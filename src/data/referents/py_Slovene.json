You must know what you are doing because,\nafter all, you are selling for a small salary your ability, which in turn de-\npends upon your knowledge - that is your answer.

By \"disregard\" I mean that we should\nlet bygones be bygones except for what we can learn from them, and\nthrow overboard all grudges we have accumulated against each other\nduring all these years in factional battles under different realms,\nwhile believing fundamentally, practically in the same principles as\nto what must be our future social order, to render equality, justice\nand international tranquillity to all mankind.\nThe main economic question is to change from private ownership of\nnatural and produced wealth to Socialism, under such regulations\nthat everyone from twenty to sixty years of age who is able-bodied\nand willing to work will have a position with enough earnings to\nbe able to acquire all the necessities of life, and the government\nwill take care of the disabled, sick, minors and the old and provide\n\nthem with sufficient income to be able to enjoy life.",
                "The machinery of production and transportation is at present so highly\ndeveloped that if properly applied to relieve the physical work of man,\na workday to produce the necessities of life would be only three or\nfour hours long.",
                "Since nothing is impossible, this will come in due time. But what will\nthe world do with it if it retains the present social order? Unemployment, \ncomparing our present state of things to the future highly\ndeveloped mechanism when man's physical endeavor will be spared, even\nbutton pressing will be replaced by telepathy, would increase to at\nleast ninety per cent of the entire population of the globe. That would\ncreate unbespeakable starvation on one side, and a wild search for\nmarkets by private capitalists on the other.",
                "Consequently, all capitalistic countries would be constantly engaged\n\nin hostile international strife; war after war would be declared by\nmasters to conquer new world markets, and all the fighting would be\ndone by the economically enslaved people that have nothing to fight\nfor. To escape such tragedy we must take in due time proper steps\nto eliminate all causes for international hate by expropriation of\n\npolitical power and economic wealth, and then establish the new social\n\norder of justice, peace and universal tranquillity. Thinking about\n\nthis I distinctly remember what our late comrade, E. V. Debs, in\n\na fiery speech in Chicago after his release from a federal prison\n\nbluntly and defiantly declared: \"I wouldn't go to a capitalistic\n\nwar at the point of a bayonet!\"",
                "Let that be well remembered by our younger generation. Fratricide\n\nin our schismatic political struggles is the worst curse we can\n\nindulge in in our organizational endeavor to unify mental and physical workers of the world.",
                "Let us discard this in favor of a new and more plausible motto: \"With\n\n\n\nmalice toward none who believe in our fuudamental principles of socialization and equal distribution of national income.\" In unifying the\n\nworking class we will be inconceivably more successful through fraternal\n\ntolerance than we have been heretofore by our condemnable schismatic\n\nquarreling in factional divisions, trying to impose on each other our\n\ndifferent petty opinions that should not, and in fact do not, change\n\nthe basic idea of the whole economic scheme on which the entire new\n\nsocial order will be built.",
                "Spread this doctrine by press and spoken word throughout the land,\n\nbuild up our newspapers and local organizations, and we will have\n\na unified international, fighting, political organization.",

Particularly has that been true in localities \nwhere our people have settled more compactly and in larger numbers.\nSay what we will, these institutions have been used and are still being\nused by the progressive and thrifty elements as savings institutions.\nMany, many have used to advantage the credit and services of these\ninstitutions to acquire their homes. Some who were not so prudent or\nwho overestimated their earning ability and plunged too deeply into\ndebt, however, could not be rescued even by such institutions. Wherever\nthe management was wise and alert to the trends and conditions it can\nbe generally said that there the association was a great asset to the\npeople and to the community. The direct opposite is true wherever the\nmanagement ignored the principal factors of good business management\nand economic tendencies.",
                "The mere fact that we were able to survive the depression gives us\n\nassurance and courage to continue. But I know that mere words are\ninsufficient to assure anyone anything in the present capitalistic\nset-up. It's got to be more than that. Action must accompany words.",
                "Permit me to say, then, that the 1937 Board of Directors of the Jugoslav \nBuilding and Loan Association have adopted, among other things,\na goal of 160 new subscribers for 1937.",
                "Ten have already begun to pay their weekly allotments. Twenty two more\nhave pledged to do the same in a short time. We are intent on disposing\nof the real estate on hand and pay off the old obligations just as soon\nas conditions warrant.",
                "Incidentally, I might say that there is a brisk demand for homes and\nthat one property has already been sold and that a number of bids on\nother properties have been received.",
                "There can be no doubt but that the experiment of the Federal Government\n\nin providing mortgage credit through Associations like ours has proved\nsuccessful. Hence, there can be no doubt but that greater support and\na more definite desire to participate in the work of these Associations\nwill be the continued policy of the Federal institution.",
                "A nation's basic wealth is its land and homes and mineral deposits.",
                "With a well organized mortgage reserve system behind it, there is no\nsounder investment than the home mortgage cooperative units or mutual\nassociations give to the investor the maximum in returns. With management, \nforesight and vision there is every reason to believe that our\nassociations can still grow and prosper and give that service, both\nto investor and borrower, that was given in the past."

This racial characteristic was the potential reason for\nthe organization of the Slovan Singing Society twenty-nine years ago (1905) in \nSouth Chicago. Immigration to the United States was not restricted at that time, \nand thousands of young men and women from the former Austrian provinces of Carniola,\nCarinthia, and Lower Styria - all three included in Slovenia - crossed the Atlantic \nin the hope of earning a better living under Uncle Sam than under the Austrian\ndouble eagle. The group settling in South Chicago and the near-by Pullman district\nlost no time in organizing their fraternal lodges, for America, unlike Europe,\ndid not provide government insurance against loss by sickness or injury. They\nalso united to establish singing clubs in the early nineties.",

This purpose is still the only motive\nthat keeps the society in existence as years with their achievements roll by. At\npresent the Slovan is the oldest Slovene singing society in the United States; like\nother societies and clubs, it has had difficulties throughout its long career.\nFinancial problems, lack of proper instructors, the World War, emigration and\nimmigration restrictions were some of the obstacles which at times almost ruined\nthe organization. At present the Slovan has seventy active members, the majority\nof them men. Never before in its history has the Society had so large a membership.",

In\nformer years dramatic performances also were presented. The Slovan has at all times\nmaintained friendly relations with other Slovene singing societies, and on many\noccasions it has co-operated with Slovene, Croatian, Servian, and German clubs in\ngiving concerts. The outstanding events in the Society's history were the gala\nconcert performances on its twentieth and twenty-fifth anniversaries in 1925 and\n1930.",

Its present headquarters are in the Calumet Park field house. In the\ncourse of its existence the Slovan has had seven directors, and Mr. Mirko G. Kuhel,\n\nthe present director, has wielded the baton for the last nine and a half years.\n\nMr. Kuhel came to America fourteen years ago. He has been a student at St.\n\nStanislaus\u2018 College in Slovenia; he attended high school here and completed two\n\nyears of college-work. He was then appointed to an executive position in one of\n\nthe Slovene\u2014American fraternal insurance corporations and since that time had very\n\nlittle leisure for other activities.",

Since he received his education on both continents, he is\n\nparticularly well adapted to give instruction in Slovene music both to immigrants\n\nand to American-born members of the choir. The Society has co-operated heartily\n\nin the movement to organize the United Slavic choral Societies of Chicago, and\n\nsincerely hopes that a permanent association will be founded."

Friendly advice, interesting news concerning our life\nhere and the people in the old country, educational and religious guarding; \nmoral, and in many cases, even financial help: all what we are\nsupposed to expect from a native publication we got, and got plenty of\nit. There is no doubt in our mind that we could not live without our newspaper. \nOur newspaper is our history; its power cannot be easily overlooked.\nAsk our old pioneers and leaders, our successful business people; all will\nconfess that Amerikanski Slovenec played an important part in their life's\nstruggles, in fights towards accomplishment.",
                "Our newspaper was the strong cement that united our divided opinion, our\n\nideal of native unity.",
                "It is true that our newspaper fulfills the ideal of native apostles.\nThirty-five years ago the voice of a small newspaper told to our people the\nfirst truth, that there is hope for all of us in America to become solid in our\nideas, economically powerful and a highly organized and respected nationality.\nFrom the Atlantic to the Pacific this friendly voice announced great news.",

                "Amerikanski Slovenec was established Sept. 3. 1891. The first issue of this\nnewspaper was printed on Racine Avenue, Chicago. The first issue and the\nothers which followed during six months were a thing looking paper of two\nsmall pages. Even in this size Amerikanski Slovenec could not exist very\nlong on account of chronical lack of money. For non-payment of rent it was\nevicted from its printing shop and forced to move to the Northside of Chicago.\nThe only way to save the paper was to find someone who would have enough\n\nmoney to finance it until subscriptions could cover the overhead. This\nsolution was found in a deal which brought about the sale of Amerikanski\nSlovenec to an ex-priest from Tower, Minn., Father Buh, who paid $600\nfor it. The man who started it and owned it is our Chicago Slovenian\nMr. Anton Murnik.",
                "Success came very soon, not through the financial standing of Father Buh,\n\nbut through his hard work and influence. There never were enough subscribers \nto pay expenses, but Father Buh found the friendly support of\n\na few sympathizers. This fact is convincing that it is not money that\n\nwill keep a publication in existence, but the personal influence and \n\nenergy of its managers.",
                "Amerikanski Slovenec moved to Tower. Minn., where Father Buh held a position\n\nas pastor in St. Martin's Church.",
                "The worst problem in the existence of\u2018 this newspaper was lack of good\n\nSlovenian writers. Reporters from small towns were not skilled in editorial\n\nwork. Translated articles sounded so funny in the Slovene language that\n\n\n\nmany readers complained that they could not understand clearly the meaning\n\nof the articles.",
                "At that time Amerikanski Slovenec had already 600 subscribers and more than\n\n200 copies were distributed free of charge. In spite of that, financial\n\ndifficulties were pressing so hard that Father Buh was forced to sell it.\n\nThis time, it seems, luck was on the side of Amerikanski Slovenec. The\n\nnew owner, Tiskovna Druzba, Joliet, Ill., put the publication on a paying\n\nbasis, but its normal existence came to an end on account of the transfer \nof its chief stockholder, Rev. Susterich, who went to Europe. Then\n\ncame the joke of a lifetime: the Slovenian newspaper passed into German\n\nownership. This period was fatal for the newspaper, but salvation came\n\nagain when Amerikanski Slovenec was bought by its present owner, Tiskovna\n\nDruzba Edinost.",
                "We must repeat again that for over 35 years our Amerikanski Slovenec has\n\nbeen the beginning of everything in Slovenian life in America. We simply\n\ncannot imagine the existence of our social, cultural and benevolent societies \nwithout Amerikanski Slovenec. We are proud of being owners of\n\nour own and oldest newspaper, and intend to support it to the end."

Of course, reference is made to the seventeen\nEnglish-speaking lodges of the SNPJ. Baseball and other sports\n\ndid not materialize as many predicted. Instead, membership campaigns, \ndances, picnics, and other means of obtaining funds to \n\nbolster the locals were instituted.

As time passes, a better system will be instituted as\n\nthe result of a better understanding of the fraternal situation.\n\nAs a general rule most of the young element is fairly well situated\n\nin other English fraternal organizations, so that our task of\n\ninteresting them is somewhat difficult. Other fraternal organizations\n\nhave more to offer in the way of recreation than the SNPJ. Consequently \nthe above is true.

The future of any Slovene\n\nfraternal organization lies in the hands of the offspring. Similar\n\nexpressions are heard and read frequently. But it is not sufficient\n\nto merely speak and write these words. It is necessary that these\n\nremarks be backed with moral and financial support. And what about\n\nthe Slovene language? What effect will these new organizations\n\nhave upon it? Heated discussions on the subject are witnessed\n\nregularly. From the most timid tales to the most capable defensive\n\narguments one is able to pick statements that would astonish even\n\nthe most unconcerned bystander. Some fear that the Slovene fraternal\n\norganizations have reached their limit; that the English subsidiary\n\nis their only salvation. Others quite differently proclaim no fear \n\nfor the language, even for the distant future. And so we conceive\n\nthe opinion that no immediate change is to take place in our\n\ngeneration because within the rank and file there exist a large\n\npercentage of those favorable to the organization of these English\nlodges yet willing to sacrifice time and money for the development\nof the Slovene language.",
                "It is true that the official business of these lodges is transacted\n\nin the English language, but it is also true that a greater percentage\n\nof these youngsters attempt in either speak, read, write, or sing\n\nin the Slovene language now more than heretofore. Prosveta is read\n\nwith delight, for it is convenient to glance from its pages to the\n\nother sections for various announcements and suggestions. What is\n\nmore, magazines such as Mladinski List and Proletarec, while not\n\nin the limelight, bear great watching. Perfected to a higher degree\n\nof satisfaction, such magazines will be of great assistance in\n\npartially keeping up the nationality. However, if the Slovene language \nis destined to extinction in this country, the English-speaking \nlodges will not be the cause nor will such lodges bear the responsibility. \nBesides being a well-balanced fraternal organization, the\n\nSlovene National Benefit Society is known to be a powerful weapon\n\n\n\nwhen used in defense of the workers.",
                "Without question it must be said that conditions, both working and\n\nliving, have been improved. Organizations such as our fraternal\n\norder have been responsible, at least in part, in bringing about\n\nsuch improvement. You might consider such action as entering\n\npolitics, but politics or otherwise, if the steps taken will\n\nbring about better living and working conditions, I deem it essential\n\nand necessary to say that our fraternal societies continue pursuing\n\nsuch tactics as long as the prevailing system of plundering the\n\nmasses last. The Jugoslav Socialist Federation and its educational\n\ndepartment is another institution which is also active in all such\n\nstruggles, as is the League for Industrial Democracy. Knowing this,\n\nhow can we fail to support them? Remembering that the years will\n\ntell the story of your present behavior, let us make history as\n\nit has never been made before.",
                "In conclusion it is necessary to appeal to the Jugoslavs of this\n\n\ncountry to help build up their race by organizing new English-speaking\n\nlodges, to keep and uphold the race by bringing up their offspring\n\nso they can speak the Jugoslav language and to support such institutions \n\nfrom whom most benefit is derived. If you do this, we can\n\nassure you that our language will not die; that the movement will\n\ngrow and prosper and will not astonish or amaze anyone.",

                "Often we glance back into the early days of childhood, dreaming of\nhow we used to run about as free as the air. Comparing those never-to-be-forgotten \ndays with the present, we say to ourselves, What\na change! For well do we remember the old Slovene settlement at\nTwenty-second and Wood streets, when that settlement was in its prime,\nwhen the industries were flourishing in the car shops, the lumber\nyards, etc. The noon factory whistles would blow and a mass of \nhumanity would dash across Blue Island avenue into their favored\nplaces with a pail called \u2018pint.\u2019 Today the noon whistles still\nblow, but not nearly as many humans scamper across the street; the\nstores of the avenue look deserted.",
                "What a change in so short a time! Of course, the war came and out\nof the war many hardships. Many disabled boys, many new millionaires\nand a period of depression. That hit our people hard, no doubt.",
                "Yes, new machinery, too, has been invented displacing men. Many\nhave moved to the west of the city; some to the north, others to\nthe south. Yet, the flow of Slovenes from other cities and places\nin the most part from the mining districts, has refilled the\nterritory. As one leaves another comes.",
                "Fifteen to twenty years is a long period of time, too. Within such\na period much can be accomplished. But it is regrettable that the\nSlovenes in this vast metropolis have nothing outstanding to which\none might point with pride. They have fostered fraternal societies, \na church and church hall. Outside of a few small business undertakings, \nwe have little to show.",
                "Our people have not been interested in politics, although they are\nbecoming more conscious politically each year. Those that did participate \nin politics, for the most part always favored the Democratic\nand Republican administrations. Each year taxes would rise, jobs\n\nwould be fewer and harder to secure. Living necessities do not balance\nwith the meager pay envelopes. So we struggle along just barely\nmaking both ends meet. Yet, our Slovene race as a whole is a progressive \nrace. However, when you scrutinize their achievements, we\nare outspoken. We have no big DOM to which we might point with\npride; no large business establishments; no cooperatives. Perhaps\nwe did not need them as bad as other large Slovene settlements.\nIt is because we have too many factions and let jealousy control\nour progress. Or is it because we always leave it to the other\nfellow to do the work? Whatever it may be, the fact remains that\nmuch more could be accomplished if the slogan of cooperation was\n\ninbedded in the mind and heart of our people.",
                "Isn't it a fact that jealousy has been responsible for so small\n\na degree of success? Time and again folks would tell us about our\n\nfraternal life; about the friction caused by mere jealousy - and\n\nthe organization of a new order wherein the years following. They\n\nhad witnessed the same jealousy segregate subordinate groups. The\n\n\nsame jealousy retards the growth of any group and ours is no exception.",
                "Chicago has had a Slovene Socialist Club for a long time. During all\n\nthese years and especially in the past fifteen years cultural work\n\nhas been progressing at very slow rate. But a large percentage of \n\nwhat has been done in this field can be attributed to the efforts\n\nof the Socialist club. The club just naturally tackled the work and\n\nknowing the responsibility of such action, it marched along as best\n\nit could under our conditions. Plays of all descriptions have been\n\nproduced, lectures on vital questions are held at frequent intervals, \nliterature of all kinds is distributed, devotees of music\n\nand song display their wares with the club's choir.",
                "Young friends, if you are at all active, or wish to become so, there\n\nis no better time than now to join the ranks of active Socialist\n\nworkers. There is no need for you to remain outside of our ranks\n\nany longer and pass away the fleeting years in the mere satisfaction\n\n\n\nof doing only what you must. Think of being able to help others.\n\nYou will find more satisfaction in that. Your ability and your\n\nearnestness is wasted unless you give the world the best you\n\npossess. We would like to see you learn more about the economical\n\nconditions which have so much bearing on your environment.",
                "It is possible to do more in the next fifteen years than in the\n\nlast fifteen. We believe so. We believe there are at least three\n\nhundred Slovenes in Chicago who should rightfully be attached to\n\nthe Socialist club. It is possible with proper judgment and unity\n\nto do something to which you can point with pride and satisfaction\n\nin years to come.",
