When on the threshold of this school say firmly to yourself: \"I must finish this school, no matter how difficult it may be!\" Decide on it in that way, and see it through. There is nothing worse than a school career not completed. People say justly, \"A student who did not complete his studies is worse than a blockhead.\" It is better to go to school and complete it than to shorten your life in some factory or in washing some Chinaman's dishes. Every worker is important, but the insulting blockhead always creates rottenness, and is an abomination. They regret that they have squandered their young lives; that is why they are always insulting and throw mud on everything. Therefore, if you begin school, complete it! Do not begin that school with the idea that you want to become a master because a person who does so never learns anything. Go to school with the idea of acquiring higher knowledge, not only for yourself but also for those who stay in the factories at hard work. They will provide everything needed in life, and you should prepare yourself to repay that debt by telling them the truth and caring for them. While you are attending school do not lose your faith--the faith of your mother and father--for when you lose that, even though you have completed your studies, you will not bring anyone any good because internally you will be burnt to ashes and your mind will be vacuous! Without the faith which your people have, you will be a wicked noisemaker and a ruined and poisoned fruit in a white collar, and with an overturned head. In this head will only be madness and contempt for the aching hand of the workingman who is providing your bread and butter. This is the greatest experience of true education, and whoever tells you otherwise is a blockhead, no matter how well he tries to fool you by showing you educational books.",

Go to school, higher school. Begin it, stay in it and complete it with a firm determination that you will serve your people with truth and not domineer over them. Then you will not be a stupid and wicked destroyer, but a real leader. Go, and do not forget this, for every word written here is the truth. Some day you will be convinced of the truth of this study."

Y. The man who made a Ukrainian course at Columbia University possible is Hon. John D. Prince, founder and present head of the Department of Eastern European languages. The work and efforts of Prof. Clarence A. Manning, Dr. Arthur P. Coleman and many Ukrainians is recognized and appreciated also, but it was the final \"yes\" or \"no\" of Hon. John D. Prince, on which the introduction of the Ukrainian course depended. Dr. John D. Prince said \"yes\", and the Ukrainian course is well on its way, accompanied by \"Evenings of Ukrainian Literature\", of great interest to many American Ukrainian students and rejoiced in by all Ukrainian people here and abroad.",

Smith, Inc., New York, 1932) when discussing the activities and abilities of members of American diplomatic corps serving in capitals of European states, observes that the ablest of American representatives are situated at the least important capitals. One of the best American representatives, he finds in the capital of Jugoslavia, and this American minister in Belgrade, is none other than our friend, Dr. John D. Prince.",

                "\"Similarly in Jugoslavia today he converses with King Alexander in purest Serbian, although the king knows French perfectly well, as does Dr. Prince. They tell a story in Belgrade, probably a bit exaggerated, of Dr. Prince's early days there. An informal gentleman, given to bright ties and not too fond of protocol, he sauntered along to the royal palace and entered. He was stopped by one of the royal sentries - those tough-looking babies in white pants who pace stiffly from morning to night guarding the portals.",
                "\"My man,\" Dr. Prince is reported to have said, \"permit me to pass, I am the new American minister\". He said it in Serbian.",

                "\"Conversation with Dr. Prince is a bit trying. At every third word uttered by a visitor the minister interrupts with a passing description of the pronounciation of the equivalent of that word in Bantu, Choctaw or South Malayan. He talks to one of his secretaries only in Russian. His researches into the various south Slav dialects - Croatian, Slovenian, Montenegrin, Bulgarian and so on, have made him famous in Jugoslavia.",
                "It is the great regret of Dr. Prince's life that he has not a perfect command of Albanian, the only European language he does not thoroughly know. It embarrasses him not to be able to converse with each member of the local diplomatic corps in his own tongue. But he solves this problem neatly by talking to the Albanian minister in Turkish. One Albanian minister, astounded and indignant, protested to his colleagues of the insolence of American government to hire Turks for its diplomatic corps.\" (pp. 485 - 486).",

May his knowledge of so many languages be an inspiration to all Ukrainian, American and Canadian youth; may he be an example for them and may Ukrainian language and literature flourish on American and Canadian soil."

The last named employs people who are specially prepared to work among children. In addition, the larger libraries have a fourth department--for newspapers and periodicals. The newspapers cannot be taken out, but the periodicals can. In the Reference Department there are special sections for law, medicine, etc.",

The public libraries here have books in the Ukrainian language, but only the large ones where Ukrainians saw to it that the library purchased them. Usually books in the foreign languages are there uselessly, because it is very seldom that anyone asks for them. The reason for this is that our people do not know that public libraries have Ukrainian literature and that if they demanded it, more would be purchased. The directors of these libraries say that they would employ workers who know foreign languages if the public wished to profit from these collections. Very seldom does anyone ask for these books because, for the past ten years, the few organs of our press occupied their time and space with bickerings and slander which turned the people to disputation instead of education.",

From these directories one can find all the addresses of friends and relatives of whom sight has been lost; addresses of night schools where many practical trades are taught free of charge; addresses and information pertaining to various factories and businesses where one might be able to secure a job or to study a special trade.",
                "The libraries also have newspapers, both old and new, of other cities, filed in yearly volumes. Whenever a workingman wishes to move to another city where he does not have any friends, he can use these newspapers, and, by looking through the \"Help Wanted\" column, secure all the information he desires, which often a friend residing in that city could not supply. It frequently occurs that the workingman has forgotten the name of the ship on which he arrived, and the exact date of its arrival. This information is needed when applying for citizenship papers. In the main libraries one can find many volumes of old daily newspapers that publish the movements of all the ships at the time in question. One should not hesitate because he does not know how to look up what he wants in the library. That is why they have librarians there: to direct him and to show him where to find it and how to find it.",
                "Whoever might care to, may quickly be convinced that libraries here are not only places where one can read comfortably and quietly, but are also places where one can obtain practical information which is very important to life and the future on this earth of the workingman and his children.",
                "That is why we say to our workingmen, \"Utilize the long evenings of your young lives in a useful way! Go to the libraries, seek there and read Ukrainian books!

                "June! Month of graduation and commencement! Graduation from the accustomed routine to the commencement of new life. This month is customarily dedicated to the graduation from an institute of education or learning. Probably you are one of these graduates, or most assuredly a friend or an acquaintance of yours is experiencing this exciting ceremony which is due to every human being. It may be from elementary school, junior and senior high schools, college, university, technical or training establishments that you are departing. You may be graduating from the elementary grades and will commence to decide your future vocation in high school; you may be finishing high school to further develop your character, mind, and body in a higher institute in order that you may fulfill your calling to the best of your abilities; or having covered the educational field you are turning your back upon schooling that you may start the greatest of many events, that of earning your own livelihood by means of your own skills, training and ideas. You are leaving an old familiar path, leaving old joys and sorrows, old hopes and disillusionments, old methods and mistakes; and with expectancy entrusting yourselves to a course which is unfamiliar.",
                "All in all you are graduating in order to commence.",
                "This month also ought to be a month of graduation and commencement for every Ukrainian boy and girl. It is time that we cast aside our intolerances toward each other; time that we refrain from entangling ourselves in petty antagonisms against groups that are not of us; time that we help and cooperate with those that are capable of leading - we, a leaderless people. Be tolerant toward others! We always hear this, many of us stress it, but very few practice that virtue. With us it is always necessary to unjustly criticize and wreck the person or group whose opinions are not similar to ours. It is absolutely impervious that we knock down the groups or organizations that are striving to do faithful work even if they may have objects parallel to our own. We ask for cooperation, yet we never have any to spare for others; not even charity. We forget that organizations are a means of strength and unity: two powers which Ukrainians need and lack. We are constantly bewailing the fact that we possess no capable leaders; yet we never fail to ruin their reputations and even lives by freely and thoughtlessly and enviously slandering them.",
                "It does seem strange and even ridiculous that we who most need tolerance, broad-mindedness, cooperation and leaders, mock and destroy these necessities. And stranger yet, we realize that these are necessities but do not strive to sincerely obtain them.",
                "Let us, then, during this month of graduation and commencement experience graduation and commencement for ourselves. Let us graduate from harmful habit and influences and commence acquiring desirable characteristics and outlooks."

                "Various attempts were made by the ancients to reconcile the month, which originally depended upon the changes of the moon, with the tropical year; however, a satisfactory solution was not possible, and the calendars of civilized nations now disregard the moon entirely.",
                "The Mohammedan nations, however, still use a lunar calendar with a year of twelve lunar months, which alternately contain 355 and 356 days. According to their methods of reckoning, the same month falls in different seasons, and their calendar gains one year on ours every thirty-three years.",
                "The Julian calendar, which was established 45 B. C. [circa] by Julius Caesar, disregarded all consideration of the moon and adopted 365\u00bc days as the true length of the year. Caesar decreed that every fourth year should contain 366 days, and transferred the beginning of the year from March 1 to January 1.",
                "The Julian calendar is still used generally in Russia and by the Greek [Orthodox] church.",
                "Another kind of calendar is the Gregorian calendar. The true length of the tropical year is not 365\u00bc days, but 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, and 45.5 seconds--a difference of 11 minutes, 14.5 seconds by which the Julian year is too long. This amounts to a little more than three days in four hundred years, and consequently the date of the vernal equinox in Pope Gregory's time had fallen back to March 11 instead of occurring on March 21 as it did at the Council of Nice in the year 325 A. D. The pope, therefore, decreed the calendar should be corrected by dropping ten days, so that the day following October 4, 1582 should be called October 15 instead of October 5 and, also, that in the future only the century years should be leap years because they were divisible by 400. Thus 1700, 1800, 1900, etc. are not leap years, while 1600, 2000, 2400, etc. are. The change was made in every country except Russia and the Ukraine.",
                "From the information given you can determine the origin of both the Julian and Gregorian calendars. Read it through carefully and try to understand who originated and later adopted the Gregorian calendar and when it was discovered that the Julian calendar was not accurate.",
                "Why is it that the Ukrainians have to be one of the two nations which use this inaccurate calendar? Think of a student coming to school three and four weeks after Easter and asking if he may have the following Monday off to go to church, because his Easter is the following Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. No student is proud to say that, but it happens quite often. Our parents have given up hope of ever seeing the Ukraine put on an equal cultural level with other countries by our adoption of the calendar that is used the world over. Let us show them that our hope has not failed, and that we are striving to have the Ukrainians adopt the calendar that is being used in all countries."

                "How does social economy appear in theory and in practice? Social or national economy is the study of the aspects and conduct of the domestic life of a nation, or of all nations. This study describes these facts, explains them, and arranges them systematically. On the basis of all this, thinking people come to many important theoretical and practical conclusions that serve the economic and political life of all the people of a nation and country. These results also have great meaning for the domestic life of many individual families, as we shall see later on from practical examples. There are many interpretations of social economy, because it is clear that the capitalist interests himself in this study from one point of view, while the workingman will interest himself in it from another. Actually they are all concerned with this study because it binds them together; but every class, and every person in every class, looks at the problems in it from different angles and from different points of view.",
                "Social economy is a great subject resting on two basic principles of capitalistic theory: personal liberty, and private ownership of property. The first principle implies that it is forbidden to put anyone to work by force; the second means that every person is forbidden to take that which does not belong to him. That is how it appears in theory, but in practice both principles appear differently. Although it is forbidden to force anybody to do a particular kind of work, people are often forced to do menial tasks because of poverty, which means that other work is not available to them as it is to those people who are prosperous. This shows that the second principle also exists for the poorer people only to a limited extent, because frequently a person who does not enjoy personal liberty must, for the sake of the money he will receive, offer his work where he did not wish to give it.",
                "Workingmen of all nations of the world endure somewhat similar living and working conditions. Only similar, but not identical, because the labor of people who do not live in their own country is done under circumstances far worse than that of those people who live in their own country. The workingman of the suppressed nation is fettered with a double chain: the economic conditions in which he lives, and authority of the country which suppresses his nation. Therefore, such people need twice as much education in order that they might profit a little from the means of modern living which social economy offers them.",
                "What sort of an outlook is this? Present-day social economy offers the two principles which we have previously considered, and it also has attached to it two more concepts without which it could not exist or else would be altogether different. What are these concepts? They are division of labor, and co-operation. We shall explain the second of these in our \"practical social economy column\" which will deal with matters related to national domestic life.",
                "First we must give you the meaning of \"co-operation\". Co-operation is the bond of the workingman to his work, and at the same time to his domestic life. What else does it mean? It means that the workingman is united to the factory or shop where he is employed, united to the country in which he resides. By what means is he thus united? By contracts, by laws or regulations, by custom, by taxes, by organizations, by costs of living, and by many other strings which for the most part he does not realize exist.",
                "In the study of economy, unity is called freedom, but in practice it turns out differently. There are two kinds of causes that change this unity to one without freedom. One of these causes can be changed for the better rather quickly, which means that the workingman will at once receive more freedom of contract when he is able to understand it. What are they? The economic position of the country in which he is living, and its working conditions. That is what we want to do in our work. It is important that this be done for the Ukrainian workingman. What does this work rest on? On a simple but very important foundation: true information about the living conditions and the working conditions in the various cities within the boundaries of Northern America (United States and Canada), including both general and particular trades.",
                "The trains are now crowded with men who are seeking work. Many people are coming to the United States from Canada because of the economic crisis there, many Ukrainians among them. It may continue like this for some time yet before the crisis is over. All of this requires that the entire Ukrainian press, both here and in Canada, turn its full attention upon the economic situation instead of always writing about politics. We want to initiate this needed change, by writing about the domestic needs of one of the largest cities of the world, Chicago. I have written these facts on the basis of stories told me by the Ukrainian workingmen who attended the banquet given in my honor by Company Fifteen of the Sitch Organization. I will write further about the tailors' trade of this city, in which over three hundred Ukrainian people earn their livelihood. I shall write about this trade and about other trades and professions with the following motive: that every Ukrainian workingman came here from his fatherland as a homeless immigrant. Many of them came here, struggling at first--perhaps even hungry for a while--but they had to have some clothing on their backs. That is why we will describe the tailors' trade first. And at the behest of the Sitch Centre, we shall give you a thorough view of the living conditions in this city."

On the outside was a continuous heavy rain. The horizon was covered with leaden clouds. A heavy oppressive fog began to spread from the lake on all sides. If only for a moment the blue sky would brighten, but no, everything remained as if it were concreted.",
                "Nature appeared obstinate and as if bent on aggravating the hope for a successful Ukrainian manifestation. Everyone was prepared for a bitter disappointment.",
                "The 30th of May also came cloudy, all swaddled with clouds. About ten o'clock that morning, the clouds became thin and the fog began to disappear. The sun began to shine in the sky.",
                "From all sides of the city and suburbs the societies accompanied by music, American and Ukrainian banners, began to move into the appointed places.",
                "Even though there were two meeting places, both were intended for the same cause.",
                "At one o'clock the signal was given at Oakley Boulevard to march on. The national march was played and all the lodges moved by fours along Chicago Avenue.",
                "At Hoyne Avenue the independent societies, already waiting in disciplined order, began to fall into one strong, unbroken phalanx. They began to flow into one big family just as the waters of the Dnieper-Slavuta flow quietly into the great depths of the Ukrainian Black Sea. A yielding peace and dignity began to show themselves on the cheeks of the people marching and in the eyes of the multitudes an unextinguished fire appeared in a stubborn determination, as if they were answering to their brothers, over the sea, asking for help in the midst of the fire and blood.",
                "The parade alone was a huge one. One had to wait for half an hour until the thirty societies that numbered nearly five thousand people passed.",
                "In the front rode men on two horses, and after them followed men bearing thirty or more flags, the flags being mostly American. Only four Ukrainian azure and gold flags were in the parade, belonging to a society which had the true national tendency. We felt the lack of our national colors.",
                "After the flags, our women followed proudly in Ukrainian costumes. This is our glory, our hope, boosting our national costumes everywhere.",

                "After this wagon there came in different formations, lodges of male societies, clubs and the sitch. After them came five allegorical emblems representing the United States, France, England, Italy and Belgium. These assured the world that the only rescue for Ukrainia is in being united with the Allies.",
                "After them followed long ranks of our men, both old and young, preceded by orchestras that played the national marches and hymns almost without stopping. Every society carried a banner with an inscription invoking the Allies and Germans to \"Let live the true democracy!\" Let live the liberty!\" \"Down with the Kaiser and his regime!\" and many such others.",
                "The thorough, dignified, saintly feeling, the sound of the national melodies and hymns; the display of American and Ukrainian colors under the blissful sun, all this added power and charm to the national manifestation.",

                "The parade came to Pulaski Park. The big hall was filled with three thousand people. Half remained in the park courtyard.",
                "Public Meeting. In the hall everyone was very calm. The band played the American national anthem. Dr. Vladimir Siemenovich greets the assembled with the words, \"Glory! Glory! Glory!\" He speaks with youthful zest about the significance of this moment and protests against the breach of Germany's agreement with Ukrainia at Brest-Litovsk. In sharp words he begs the gathering to protest against the violence of Germany toward Ukrainia.",
                "The second speaker on the platform was Father Nicholas Hutynsky. He spoke with great enthusiasm, pointing to the gains of the French and American revolution, pointing out that our future lies in the lot of truly democratic states of the world and in the loyalty of the Ukrainians to the United States.",
                "The third speaker was Dr. Stephen Hryniewiecky, whom the public greeted with great applause.",
                "He spoke in a dignified manner and with well chosen words, joining his address in thought to those of the previous speakers, assuring us that notwithstanding all the adverse powers, our nation remains still in its harmonious strength, in its national consciousness and solidarity.",
                "Every speech was alternated with singing by the choruses of M. Sysenko, Boyan and Bandurysk. They impressed the listeners with beautiful native and foreign songs. All the choruses sang wonderfully, feeling the importance of the time and place. Above all the Boyan chorus was at its zenith under the capable direction of Madam Hryniewiecky, with its strength, fairness and symphony.",
                "Then followed speakers from other Slavic nationalities according to the program. Mr. I. Smolinsky greeted the Ukrainian assembly from the Poles. He wished freedom to the Ukrainians, Poles and all the Slavic peoples.",
                "The greatest enthusiasm was shown when the American congressman, Mr. McCormick, appeared. With a strong voice he won the souls of the listeners very effectively. He spoke on the meaning of today's war, pointing out the facts about the Allies, saying that in the United States is found the only bulwark of real democracy, and the mainstay of the Allies' strength. This in the end will put down the brutal German militarism. He bade the Ukrainians join the Allies.",
                "After him followed Mr. Stepina, who spoke for the Czechs, pointing out that Austria and Germany are the greatest enemies of all the Slavs.",
                "Dr. A. Biankini, for the Croatians, wished for the Ukrainians their freedom, stating that the future hope of the Slavs lies in the federation of all the Slavs.",
                "Mr. J. Palandech spoke for the Serbs. He said that the Serbs and the Montenegrins sacrificed their lives in the World War for their liberty and that of all the Slavs.",
                "Mr. I. Zuzek spoke for the Slovenes and assured the Ukrainians of the sympathy and the attachment of the Slovenian people to the Ukrainians.",
                "Father H. Pakalnis, on the part of the Lithuanians, shortly related the history of the union of Ukrainia with Lithuania, and talked on the Polish nobility as the mutual enemy of both Lithuania and Ukrainia.",
                "Among other Ukrainian speakers that deserve credit are Mr. P. Ikach, who spoke for the Ukrainian Federation of the Socialist Party in America. He protested against Germany's abolishing the Ukrainian Central Rada (council) and against the self-styled hetman Skoropadsky.",
                "Then followed Father H.Homitsky who fervently pointed out the progress of the struggle for the national liberty of the Ukrainians in Austria and begged them to join all the other Slavic nations against Germany and Austria.",
                "Every speaker was greeted with great applause, and everyone went home filled with enthusiasm.",
                "After the meeting followed a reception in the Hotel La Salle, in which practically all the speakers took part.",
                "On the following morning news of the Ukrainian manifestation appeared in almost all the local American newspapers.",
                "The fullest account appeared in the Daily News, the Tribune, and the Morning Herald.",
                "Yet these news articles were all very short in spite of the fact that there were two American correspondents at the gathering who were given ample and exhaustive information. The article printed in the above mentioned newspapers were beneficial mostly to the Slavonic League, whose existence we do not even know, let alone how this league favors the Ukrainian cause. In them, likewise, were registered personal ambitions of some of our leaders, who are infected with the mania for greatness, and who want to obtain the biggest credit and glory for themselves. They would surely take all the credit to themselves if they could, for planning this manifestation, especially those that probably did not use any effort at all. It would be well if the leaders who are better informed about this Slavonic League would convey to us what positions they hold in the above mentioned League.",
                "In the end we can proudly state that the Ukrainian colony in Chicago acquired great moral benefit from this manifestation.",
                "The people saw for themselves how strength is created when they unite solidly in the national cause.",
                "We expected, however, that the arrangers of the manifestation would know how to interest American political circles in the Ukrainian cause on a broader scale. In this direction the manifestation brought little or absolutely no gain! For this great failure on the part of those who arranged the Ukrainian manifestation there awaits a reckoning before our people, who underwent so much trouble and who made such heavy expenditures."

                "The misunderstanding between the benefit associations and the political organizations has no perceptible effect upon the attitude of the Ukrainian immigrants. Why? Because the national spirit is too powerful to be touched by these disagreements. It is noteworthy that the great body of Ukrainians is really in accord with the political organizations, as well as, with the benefit associations. This is true because of the strong bond of national unity. Little misunderstandings, unnoticeable friction, in the realm of politics is not only not harmful, but is on the contrary, unavoidable, very beneficial, and necessary to the life of the organizations. The one main ideal is never lost sight of, viz: Freedom for their own nation. These misunderstandings are due to the fact that some do not have sufficient knowledge and understanding of national questions. The shortcoming of this paper Workman could suitably be its chaos.",

                "The political policy of all our benevolent society organs, is one: against Germany, against Austria, and sympathy with the Allies and the Ukrainian nation. We do not intend to repeat the strong arguments of our worthy newspapers which have so thoroughly discussed this question. We believe there is not a single Ukrainian in the United States or Canada who would have a different attitude; that is, who would not take sides with the Allies, and the Ukrainians, against Germany and Austria.",
                "It is a fact that there was no special agitation among the Ukrainians for any one political set-up. Again, the orientations as before so now, is not an artificial outcome of a certain political or benefit association. Slight differences in our orientation have occurred as if by means of some unseen force during the last four years. These truths can not be denied by anyone. These are facts and need no further proofs. Yet it would be interesting to explain them.",
                "First: Why are benefit associations which are somewhat hostile as far as business is concerned, yet, are all bound in a wise, one-front, all-national understanding?",
                "Secondly: Why do our political national organizations, such as the Federation of the Ukrainians in the United States, and The Ukrainian Council, in Philadelphia, which are mutually great enemies, so opposed to each other just like fire and water, why do they have, we ask, this one and the same beautiful aim, the establishment of national unity among Ukrainians? From our investigation we cast out the socialistic federation party in the United States and which we do not acknowledge as an organization at all, and which is, according to our views, a foolishly childish burlesque of socialism.",
                "The answer to the first as well as to the second question is one. It is the national spirit which, by the law of nature, must evolve. Once its evolution is begun no counter force, no enemy can suppress it.",
                "Nations are made up of individuals, and they have the same right to freedom as each individual has; therefore, a nation must have a full right to independent freedom and must not be impeded in its evolution.",
                "But can our nation live in freedom under the control of German iron-clad militarism, when in our own home not we, but a foreign element, shall be the boss? The answer is self-evident. This was the cause to wake up our energetic nation politically with the slogan: \"Away with the militarism of the Central Powers ! Away with the control of our nation ! Let freedom of the free nations live!\"",
                "The spirit of this slogan swayed all our newspapers abroad. This attitude of the Ukrainians in the United States is not the result of any agitation, but is just merely the natural outcome of a healthy national spirit.",
                "The Ukrainian colony in the city of Chicago displayed its energetic national spirit in the preparation of the Ukrainian manifestation, held on May 11, 1918.

It is no wonder that our Ukrainian people composed the proverb, \"With a mother and no father, the child is one and one-half; but without a mother and with a father, the child is just an orphan.\" Therefore, we women should not hide that with which nature has endowed us so generously! It is necessary that we all stand for our rights, especially because our obligations are far more important than those of the men!",

We want our Ukrainian people to be cultured and free, so let there be no woman who feels unconcerned about her obligations.

                "Those opposing our organization say, that our organization has its aim to disrupt the existing benefit associations, of which there are enough in America, and through this neither of them will ever be able to rise to a high financial level. They naturally give advice to back the women's organization on true educational grounds, without any benefit basis. He who knows the history of our immigration will be able to discover that among our people in America such associations grew faster, when they were backed on some financial (benefit or insurance) grounds.",
                "That is why the organizers of the women's organization decided to gather the women in this type of a society, which by experience made the best progress here in America.",
                "Money paid for insurance is not wasted but is a banked capital for a good interest.",
                "In Europe the father leaves his family land. Here in America the working class has no land to leave for their children. The lack of other assurance is substituted by insurance. In other nationalities every member of the family is insured, not only the parents. Big American rich men, even though they have enough money, in addition to it insure themselves for a large sum. If the insurance was a waste of money, as you can often-times hear among our people, then thoughtful people would not insure themselves; still they act on the contrary. The unthoughtful back out of it, as if it were an evil.",
                "We again state, that though we value the good points of insurance, the financial assurance is not the only aim of the \"Ukrainian Women's Alliance of America\". There is an additional aim, which is the main object of our program, namely, the enlightment of our women, and the gathering our women for the national and community work. This is our main purpose, and this is the plan we are determined to follow."

                "When we think upon important obligations that women have to fulfill and the influence that they have on the national life, we shall then see what a wife means to a husband, a mother to children, a housewife to a household.",
                "Can a husband expect enjoyment in life when in marriage - in this purest union of mutual associations - he sees only the misfortunes? What will happen to children who are the future generations of all nations, when the mother neglects them from the very beginning of their existence?",
                "Housewives destroy homes or build them. On them depends the question of the family's prosperity and health, or its misfortune and dissolution. A sensible woman builds the home while a foolish woman wrecks it with her own hands, says the national proverb.",
                "Where a home has a decent, understanding housewife, the home is the abode of peace, of concord, and of love. When a woman abandons the great purpose with which she is charged by the very nature of her position; where she merely exists in the family, neglecting to develop her spiritual qualities, and living a worthless, useless life - in such a home the beauty of life is lost, and in its stead comes discord, hatred and misfortunes.",

                "What are we women to do here in America? Our life seethes with confusion. We settle in the slums and do not show ourselves in public life among the people. With this inactivity no cause, neither our own personal affairs, nor our national life, is of any interest to us.",
                "We think that we are created only to look well while young, to dress well, to work hard for others. Sometimes we go to dances and eventually we get married. Then we grow old and die, leaving behind us no fond remembrances. This is the life of a servant, a slave, a purposeless creature, and unworthy serf. We must remember we are rational beings.",
                "It must not continue like this. We, the Ukrainian women, must learn to think independently, to gaze at the world with our own eyes, and interest ourselves with things of public and national importance. When we put this question to ourselves: \"What are nations?\" After a thorough consideration, we come to the conclusion that they are a union of families, which have a great deal in common. It is evident at once that every mother of a family has the greatest obligation to carry out. Obligations imposed upon women should not confine themselves only to one's own family by blood, but should spread themselves to the families of one's native people. The existence of a nation requires work in community life with all its sons. Without work the nation fails.",
                "Yet all do not work with us. That is why the cause of women has laid the burden of this message upon us, of asking all the members of Ukrainian families, including women, to work for the national cause.",
                "Nature provided us with the heart and the courage to stand. With these qualities every husband is able to stand. When we, the women, devote ourselves. to the national cause we shall bring to the work all those men that still sleep shamelessly.",
                "The Ukrainian nation is carrying on an obstinate fight now for its existence. Beyond the ocean, in our native land, they all work harmoniously together for the independence of their fatherland. They call upon us to be ready to help them. As with other nations, so it is with us. Women should be the very fire, the zeal, the warmth that adds willingness to the fighters in a war for a better lot.",

But let us remember that our nation is ruined by war, that it needs creative strength for its existence which will make it stead-fast in attaining its aspirations. We shall stand for our native country in its great adventure. We shall return to the old country more enlightened than we left it. With due knowledge we will be in power to rear the future generations in a better way for our country. We will give to the fatherland strong and healthy sons both in spirit and in body, sons who will be able to defend our native country from its wicked enemies. There is no luck, there is no better lot in the world than that afforded by an education.",

                "The notes of Dr. Sieminovich indicate that the Sieminovich family originated in Lithuania, where they are mentioned in historical documents as far back as the fifteenth century. From Lithuania the family migrated to the eastern Ukraine, where it produced a number of Ukrainian priests and patriots.",
                "The deceased Dr. Sieminovich after completing his high school and college studies in Buchacz and Berezany and serving in the Austro-Hungarian army entered the university, taking up the study of law. His career at the university was soon terminated, for he was called to America by Father O. Voliansky to help organize the Ukrainian emigrants. Dr. Sieminovich came to the United States in 1887, and for some time he edited a Ukrainian Newspaper,\"America\"; he was also a church singer, and organized many Ukrainian churches and co-operative societies. He took an active part in cultural work among the first Ukrainian emigrants.",
                "After some time he began the study of medicine in American universities. After completing his course he became a physician. In 1898 he went to Europe to pursue his medical studies further. After returning to the United States he became a professor in the Chicago Medical University, where he lectured on childbirth and female troubles.",
                "The greater part of Dr. Sieminovich's life was sacrificed in nationalistic community work. He was head of the enlightenment movement for the Ukrainian National Association, for which he wrote many cultural books; he also edited Enlightenment, a newspaper. In 1930 and 1931 he edited the newspaper Ukraina in Chicago.",
                "He had lived in Chicago for the last forty years. He was organizer of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic church here. He also took an active part in organizing the Intelligence Club. Besides all this he did work for various Ukrainian publications in Europe, especially Woman's Destiny, which he helped morally and materially.",
                "Dr. Sieminovich always participated in every movement that was promoted by Ukrainians. The deceased even during the worst circumstances of his life never fell into despair, and even up to his death he believed that the Ukrainians would have their own independent country, saying that of the Ukrainian ethnological masses a nation will be formed.",
                "In the presence of a great crowd of people the burial took place on Friday, June 17; his final resting place is the St. Nicholas Church Cemetery.",
                "Father P. Tarnawsky said a few words, full of feeling, over the grave of the deceased, pointing out the good traits of Dr. Sieminovich's character."

                "Mr. Peter R. Gonsky, the head of this dignified business, has become wealthy by putting his time, and no doubt many sleepless nights, into this business.",
                "He has not ceased to be a Ukrainian; not has he for a moment lost sight of the national cause, nor his native Ukrainian people.",
                "He is now with us and he will remain with us both in times of prosperity and of want. Mr. Peter R. Gonsky has already given proof of this, not once, but a number of times by contributing liberal sums of money to the national cause.",
                "Mr. Peter R. Gonsky is a bright living example for us, showing us that we should engage in commerce, manufacturing and business if we want to gain power for ourselves and our native country.",
                "Let anyone of our readers who thinks that this is an exaggeration take a little time off and ride over to the factory. He will be convinced that we have not written a thousandth part of what the human eye can see there.",
                "We give the address of the Ukrainian factory in another place of this issue.",
                "This factory is our glory, due to the endeavor of Mr. Peter R. Gonsky. It now brings a big income to the Ukrainian company. Congratulations to Mr. Peter R. Gonsky."

                "Mr. George Benetsky comes from an old Ukrainian family dating back as far as hetmanism. He is a professional opera singer, a lyric tenor. He studied music in Kiev and other places, and after serving in the army during the war, he began in 1920 to sing in operas and concerts. He was engaged by the King's Opera in Serbia, and traveled through South America with the Alexander Koshetz Chorus as a soloist. In 1923 he came to the United States, and sang with great success the tenor roles in various opera companies, among them the International, the American, and the Ukrainian National Theater in New York. On the Ukrainian stage he sang about twenty-five different parts and portrayed such characters as \"Andrey\" in \"Kateryna\"; \"Zaporoztsi\" (Zaporozians); \"Peter\" in \"Natalka\"; \"Leo\" in \"Utoplenoy\" (Drowning); \"Hrytz\" (Harry) in \"Oy Ne Hody Hrytziu\" (Oh! Do Not Come, Harry): \"Ilko\" (Elias) in \"Chornomortziah\" (Black Sea Coast), and many others. At the same time, George Benetsky was the organizer of a vocal mixed quartet which appeared with symphony orchestras at large symphonic concerts and in the best American theaters. This quartet gave over three hundred concerts. In New York, in 1927, George Benetsky became the director of a chorus, and was widely acclaimed. Upon coming to Chicago in 1928, he was asked to become musical director of the Chicago Ukrainian Chorus, which was to be the nucleus of the \"All-American\" chorus for the Chicago World's Fair. Last year, the Chorus appeared successfully in many concerts and over the radio, and for the first time in Chicago they presented the Ukrainian opera \"Kateryna,\" which was arranged and produced by George Benetsky last spring.",
                "On August 23, this chorus entered the Contest of Choruses which was sponsored by Chicago's largest newspaper, The Chicago Daily Tribune. At this contest the Ukrainian Chorus, under the baton of George Benetsky, was proclaimed the first chorus of Chicagoland, and was the only one to be invited to sing at the festival (for 150,000 listeners). The Chorus received the first (and only) prize: a large gold medal for each singer, and a gold medal and a valuable director's baton for George Benetsky."

                "The praiseworthy and remarkable quality of his character is that he always and everywhere in an artistic and musical world admits that he is an Ukrainian. He finished public school at Zarudia, county of Zboriv, and in his boyhood went to Germany for work. Over there in Germany he saved a little money and left for the United States of America in 1912. Here in this country he got a job in a furniture shop for $5 a week. In 1913 he received a job in a bakery shop, and in the evenings took instruction and lessons in music from the director of the Ukrainian band existing at that time in Chicago. In 1914 he began to learn the goldsmith's business and worked in that business till 1917, receiving wages of $12 per week.",
                "While working at a goldsmith's shop he continued his studies in music, taking private lessons in music for two years from the German professor, Mr. Karl Brown. In 1917 in April, he enlisted voluntarily in the military band of the 131st Infantry Regiment. From the regiment to which he was enlisted he was sent out by regiment command to the military musical school, where he studied music for two years and took the examinations for band instructor and in a short time after he was promoted to the rank of sergeant and in 1918 he became concert master. In the same year ye returned to Chicago and received a scholarship.",
                "In order to get a diploma from the Musical College, the same student must have at first the diploma from high school. Therefore, John Barabash not being in possession of such a diploma from high school, started to complete a high school course and to get a required diploma. He was working for his living with a theatrical orchestra in the evenings, and at nights and by day for four and a half years he was attending the YMCA school. In 1920 he enrolled at Harrison High School, and after four years of hard studies he finished high school and musical college.",
                "Being a student in high school and musical college, he gave instruction and lessons to the Ukrainian band and some Ukrainian students. He already, as a student at high school, was conducting the high school band and was arranging the school musical performances.",
                "After receiving a diploma from high school and musical college he became a musical teacher at the same school and in this position he remains till this day. At the end of 1924 he accomplished an examination for the director of military music, being promoted to the rank of captaincy of the 131st Infantry Regiment of the United States Army of America.",
                "Captain John Barabash is studying now a course of music at the Northwestern University, preparing himself for the highest examination of the department of music, namely, the decree of Master of Music. In 1924 he was appointed a teacher to the Ukrainian parochial band at St. Nicholas Church in Chicago, in 1926 he participated with a young Ukrainian band in the contest of the public school bands in Chicago The Harrison High School band participating in that contest won the first prize, under the direction of Captain John Barabash, and in April of this year (1930) the Chicago Daily News invited Captain John Barabash with his Harrison High School band to the public music festival to take the part in a contest of all the high schools of Chicago.

Just think what a grand star she would make, if she could give all of her time and attention to this artistic profession. In this role, she had one great disadvantage, her partner was suffering from a severe case of the grip. He could hardly sing at all, and most of his part he skilfully recited; yet she knew how to cover it up so deftly that it would have taken a real artist, who knows opera quite well, to notice the shortcomings of this opera. So much for the actors.",

Regardless of how good the orchestra may be, or how excellently the players may perform, a joint practice in rehearsal in indispensable; here was the real difficulty. Even though the chorus could have been compared to a human pipe organ, and the orchestra was well selected for the occasion, they could have performed together much better if they had both sacrificed more time for joint rehearsals. Fortunately, they came out quite well, but on the other hand it tells us that although we have such a capable company both of musicians and performers, there was room for improvement from the general point of view. Well, as long as there is worth-while material, and they are conscious of their shortcomings, then all that is needed is more general practice with the orchestra.",

It may be of importance to some to know that the hall containing 3,000 chairs was filled almost exclusively by Ukrainians.

Many speakers had a chance to express themselves at this banquet, but they unanimously had words of cordial welcome and sincere gratefulness for A. Koshets and the Choir. Mr. Koshets thanked the speakers for their warm words of appreciation as well as for the presents received. Here he described and related with more detail the Ukrainian National Choir and its traveling mission all over the world. The Choir did its part and sang a few songs which satisfied very well those present.",
                "During the banquet the well-known orchestra of John Barabash played.",
                "On Sunday, Mr. A. Koshets and his assistant Prof. Harry Tuchapsky were present at Mass at the St. Nicholas Church, the corner of Oakley Blvd. and Rice St. Dr. Joseph Nazaruk, special representative from Ukrainia, was also present.",
                "The same afternoon Mr. A Koshets was invited to a huge meeting called by Dr. Jos. Nazaruk. Invited by the latter as well as by the entire Meeting Committee, Prof. A. Koshets made an exceptional impression upon the audience with his speech. He showed himself to be a master of eloquence.",
                "Immediately after the meeting, the Ukrainians went to hear the Ukrainian National Choir at the Medinah Temple. Due to the fact that the Ukrainians attended the mass meeting in the afternoon, not many of them attended the Choir concert; nevertheless, the spacious hall was filled to its capacity by the American public.",
                "The program of the concert was different from the former ones. Even the regular attendants of all the concerts of the Choir, as well as the entire audience were much pleased, because these numbers and the presentation of them were something entirely new to the audience. Miss Nina Koshets sang some of the solos, such as, \"Oh, Mother,\" and \"Tra-la-la!\" May I add that this hall is twice as large as the former.",
                "It is next to impossible to describe every singer of the Choir individually, or every number separately. Let the heart in its higher aspect alone judge what an impression each and every number left on the audience. Self-praise gets no one anywhere; therefore, let me cite from some of the local American newspapers about the Choir:",
                "\"Hail and sincere thanks to you, great conductor A. Koshets, and to your choir. You seem to us like our native nightingales.\"",
                "\"Hail to you! By singing about the freedom of Ukrainia, you are strengthening her aims and endeavors.\"",
                "\"We salute you for your divine and melodious way of telling us who you are and who your ancestry is!\"",
                "Sing, therefore, for us and for others! Sing about the famous Siege of the past and their dauntless heroes, who with their very breasts like bulwarks, protected for centuries not only Ukrainia, but also the whole Western civilization against the savage hordes of Turks and Tartars and other migrating Asiatic tribes. Tell the world through the medium of songs, what Ukrainia is: that she is one of the richest countries in the world; that for many centuries her cossacks have done far more than their share for the preservation of the whole Western civilization and culture. Through the medium of our song make the world recognize the immortal fame and glory of the Ukrainian cossacks, saviors of European culture.",

Since its organization in 1928, this chorus has marched forward and is an inspiration to all those who find obstacles only an incentive to their removal, - a chorus of men and women who find their courage renewed by song, and who face the future unflinchingly, refusing to admit there is such a thing as the impossible.",
                "For taking the initiative in organizing the chorus, Mrs. Alice Howard, an American of keen artistic sense, is to be highly credited. Knowing that Ukrainians excel in the field of song, she herself appealed to Ukrainian-Americans of Chicago and met a hearty response in the persons of George Benetzky, a great conductor, thirty talented singers, and a benevolent patron, Mr. Conrad Sawiak. Its march started December 28, 1930, in full native costume in gay color and proud triumph in the first official concert appearance at the Civic Theatre. Presenting a comprehensive program of selected folk material from Ukraine with the purest harmony of their capella voices, it at once enchanted a large audience. Since this official introduction of the music world, every succeeding appearance of the Ukrainian Chorus of Chicago added to its capabilities and marked a new step in choral achievement.",
                "In events of major importance such as the Chicagoland Music Festival, given by 35 newspapers with the Chicago Daily Tribune leading, it had participated, taking twice the first prize in the mixed choral contests for five states, at the 1930 and 1931 fetes respectively. No other chorus in America ever repeated a like tremendous victory. Leading American music critics, hearing the Ukrainian Chorus of Chicago, wrote that its successes were not at all surprising.",
                "In its musical tours in Chicagoland, the Ukrainian Chorus of Chicago was called a \"hit\" and praised very highly. In the great Carnival of Nations Finals of 1931 and 1932, respectively, the Chicago Daily News featured the chorus especially.",
                "Upon invitation of the Civic Music Association, the chorus sang at the Civic Auditorium in La Porte, Ind., and at the High School Auditorium in Sheboygan, Wis. Both of these concerts were very successful.",

                "Representing standards highly professional, the Ukrainian Chorus of Chicago during the past six years established itself in community choral singing and as one of the finest choruses helped usher in a new dawn in music, especially in Chicago. Absorbed into our standardizing American life, it has both delighted and acquainted American music lovers with something that is new in song, both in technique and in theme.",

The girl's stepmother supports this plan, since the priest's son is her lover and she sees the opportunity to continue her affair after the marriage. But the girl has a sweetheart of her own choice, who, with the help of a gypsy horse-dealer, contrives to defeat this plan and to marry the girl himself. The cunning gypsy recalls a popular superstition about the Sorotschintzi Fair to the effect that the devil, who had once lost an expensive red coat in the fair grounds, returns each year to look for it in the guise of a pig on long, stilt-like legs. Taking advantage of this superstition, the gypsy and the girl's sweetheart succeed in terrorizing the people into believing that the fair grounds are haunted by the devil. In the panic which ensues, they frame the girl's father, accusing him of horse stealing, having him arrested, tied and thrown into a barn, where he remains over night. They also catch the stepmother in a compromising situation with the priest's son, and treat them in a similar manner. In the morning they offer to release the prisoner and suppress the evidence of their guilt on the promise that they will consent to the girl's marriage to the sweetheart of her choice. The prisoners agree to this, are released, and the marriage takes place amid merry festivities."

                "Last Sunday the Ukrainian Cossack Chorus of Chicago celebrated their first anniversary. The chorus for the first time sang at High Mass at St. Nicholas church, and after this went to the picnic, run for this occasion, where a wonderful time was had by all. June 28, 1934 was the first birthday of the Chorus, for it was exactly a year that Mr. Sam Czuba with about fifteen (15) boys held their first rehearsal. After seven weeks of practice the chorus won second place in the Chicagoland Music Festival Contest. Three and one-half months after the contest the chorus made a trip to Detroit and ran two concerts and sang a radio program. On May 19, 1934 the chorus sang at one of the biggest concerts ever held in Chicago, that of the Ukrainian Soyuz of America, at which Mayor Kelly was present. In all the chorus made seventeen(17) appearances in Chicago and three in Detroit, which is quite a record for any one year \"old\" chorus to beat. The boys have made a hit with the public, but it was not done without effort and self-sacrifice. They have succeeded, but only by diligent work which climaxed by learning the whole mass during the period of two weeks."

                "The Ukrainian national songs have great significance, because of their close tie with the life of the nation whom they most faithfully bring out in its true light. It is a perfect mirror of the Ukrainian nation, so to speak. In beautiful songs people sing out their troubles, such as, a mother over the baby in the cradle; the sincere love of youth; the sufferings of a jilted lover; the homesickness of a recently married woman; the sorrow of father and mother as they miss their recently married daughter, whose future is uncertain; the tragedy of a wife who is being chided by her unsympathetic husband, or the abuses perpetrated upon her by her vicious mother-in-law; the poor widow moistening her scanty field with tears; the weeping of an orphan on the grave of her mother; the entire human life from birth to death with all its troubles and jolly moments are reflected almost perfectly, in those popular songs of ours. And because the life of our peasant is rather bitter, with comparatively few moments of happiness, nay our whole nation, from its very childhood, does not enjoy a better fate; this is why our popular songs have such a pathetic feeling; they bring to the soul some mysterious pensiveness over human fate.",
                "At times girls and mothers mournfully sing the pathetic songs of farewell partings with young lovers; of a young cossack or soldier who went to war and did not return. Often soldiers express longing in their songs to return to their native homes when they are under rigorous discipline while serving in the army.",
                "The Ukrainian popular songs not only bring out life of the present day, but some of them go way back into antiquity, into those days of yore, when our ancestors were still pagans, and were recognizing the forces of mother nature and heavenly bodies, such as, the sun, the moon, the stars, and lightning.",
                "These are all clearly brought out in our popular Christmas carols; Little Christmas songs of praise; grand Spring and Easter songs, as well as the unique songs on the eve of St. John the Baptiste.",
                "There are many songs in which the people sing about the war expeditions into distant countries from which they brought home trophies and spoils; the people sing about the old princes and counts; about the invasions by the Tartars and Turks; about wars of our Ukrainian cossacks against the Poles and Russians; about the serfdom; about the draft to military service. All these songs picture to us the past life of our nation, painting it with lively colors. All these songs tell us who we are. Whose sons we are; who our fathers were, for whom and to what are we chained.",
                "Thereby we see that the national songs are not merely a useless past time of the present age. In songs our nation has narrated about its present and past life; about everything that makes it happy and everything that ails it. Through songs the nation has confessed all its joys and troubles; songs have opened the very soul of the nation.",

Edelman who started a spark of desire among the musically talented, energetic Ukrainian youth. From that time on they formed a club, and until June, 1921, it had many ups and downs. There was a time when it was dubious whether or not the band could exist any longer, so much so that for a time a semi-conductor had to take charge of the band. Dmitro Goy understood possibly more than anybody else the importance of such a band among the Ukrainians in Chicago. He did everything in his power to help this band exist in those days of crisis. After the World War, John Barabash, an American veteran, became the conductor. From that time on, the Ukrainian band in Chicago became more and more successful by leaps and bounds."

                "Our publication has withstood this test. It has not only passed the trial, and a severe one at that, but has established a name for itself, a name that may well be envied by many for what other youth publications in the English language can claim. For three years it has been published by the youth, for the youth! What other publication of this calibre can boast that it has not been financially dependent upon an organization of the older generation? None.",

                "However, why should we compliment this faithful servant. Actions speak for themselves and readers of the Ukrainian Youth. If anyone does deserve compliments, it is the Ukrainian Catholic Youth League, the organization which mothers this child of ours. To this organization compliments are in order, compliments, not of words only but of deeds.",
                "Complimentary words are pleasant to the ear, and may even be necessary for moral support, but they are not sufficient. Show the League and the Ukrainian Youth your appreciation by enlarging the membership of the Ukrainian Catholic Youth League with the enrolment of your club, compliment it by gaining another subscriber for the Ukrainian Youth, or by renewing your own subscription if it has expired. Celebrate the third birthday of the Ukrainian Youth by sponsoring an affair for the press fund of the paper. Everywhere and at all times, by word and deed, spread the good name of this publication, and work hand in hand with the Ukrainian Youth and Ukrainian Catholic Youth League for the highest ideals possible, for God and country."

Lack of the printed, non-partisan, Ukrainian word, that would dull the sharp ends of partisan saores and would bring the society to that order which behooves the twenty five thousand Ukrainians. As it used to be formerly--a brother avoided his brother and a friend overlooked his friend. The supposedly twenty five thousand Ukrainians in Chicago, fighting among themselves, morally without any resulting good from either this or that thought. The consequences of this will be as follows: we cannot help the country from which we originate in its misfortunes, or, take part in this city life in particular and American life generally; nor can we help ourselves much. The \"watchword\" \"support your own kind\", has long ago been forgotten. The only ones who know where our places of business are with small exceptions, are probably, only the Christmas Carolers and other collectors, that do not forget to visit them regularly and remind them of the motto: \"keep your national solidarity\". Ukrainia will strive to introduce among its people the \"modus vivendi\" with the Ukrainian groups in Chicago, and will back enterprises furthermore, it will help in the economic development of the Ukrainians in Chicago.",

This new executive committee made a firm decision to buy and own a Siege press. And there a chance presented itself to realize the decision. The Ukrainian Publishing Company was bought by Messrs. Andrew and John Bulkas, and Michael Yavorsky.",
                "Therefore, on February 26, 1922, the executive committee of the Siege organization passed a resolution to buy the whole press outfit for the fixed sum of $2,300. For this reason they sent out one of the officers Peter Didyk, to other Siege branches and districts, to appeal to the members to contribute to the press fund and thereby help realize the purchase of a so much needed press for Siege organization.",
                "Due to much unemployment that year, the purchase of the press was almost out of question, because from March, 1921, to the date of purchase only four hundred dollars was in the bank for that purpose.",
                "Until after New Year's 1922, after a reorganization of the executive staff in the headquarters, the resolution of buying a Siege press was renewed with more action behind it.",
                "They got in touch with the three owners of the press.",
                "The gentleman that busied himself most on this account was Dr. Stephen K. Hrynevetsky, through his organization assistant, L. Stachursky. The former, as chief executive of the organization and a sincere Siege member, who has the good of the organization at heart, proved to the owners of the press how much good they would do for Ukrainians in general and particularly the organization, if they the three owners, would only let the press go for a somewhat lower price.",
                "The Executive Staff invited the owners of the press to the meeting on January 22, 1922. It was then that Mr. Michael Yavorsky gave up his share, amounting to seven hundred dollars, in favor of the organization, and the brothers Andrew and John Bulka let eight hundred dollars off their two shares, and so on January 12, 1922, the printing machinery of the Ukrainian Publishing Co. became the property of the Siege Organization as per the agreement and contract, which is now in possession of the general financial secretary.",
                "When the time for the first payment came, on January 26, at the presentation of a note for the last four hundred dollars for the machinery. Messrs. Bulkas donated that amount to the organization and signed an acknowledgment \"Paid in full.\" Thus all the press machinery was bought for only $400 instead of $2,300 as was originally, anticipated in 1921.",
                "No lesser recognition should go to Mr. K. Kopchynsky, linotype operator for the former Ukraina Publishing Company. He, with his cooperation, helped the former three owners hold the ownership of the press machinery, and thus prevented it from going into undesirable hands. He also did everything in his power because he wanted to see it become the property of the Siege organization. Many thanks to him for this noble work.",
                "Messrs. Michael Yavorsky, John and Andrew Bulkas are members of Bohdan Chmelnitsky Siege, branch No. 15, in Chicago.",

He is an obstinate person where truth is concerned. Since he did so much for the progress of the Ukrainian factory in which Peter Gonsky is president, we are sure that he will not spare himself and will try his utmost in helping to uplift Ukraina to its highest peak.",

For a long time there has been felt very keenly the lack of such a Ukrainian medium. Many an effort has been made in this direction; yet they all came to naught, not so much because of lack of the material aid, but rather because of the want of people who could sacrifice their time and labor toward the publication.",
                "It was just with the arrival of Mr. G. T. Popel in Chicago that the matter of the newspaper has been definitely settled. With the moral and material support of the Chicago community, a weekly paper in Chicago began its existence. As its title shows, it is supposed to be a medium altogether independent from all parties--a national-patriotic progressive newspaper, the kind that for a long time was lacking, not only in the West but also in all America as well.",

Thus, to our newspaper, there was nothing left except to work in the field which the progressives, parties, and sectarians had left untilled in the struggle for our ideals.

They planted a seed which grew into the Trident News, a monthly magazine of which the first issue went into circulation on November 1st. Everywhere it was received with open arms, and the enthusiasm of the Y.U.N. members knew no bounds. But little did they, or even the staff, headed by Editor Michael Senchuk and Business Manager John Sawchyn, speculate or guess, or even dream, that some day it would develop into the official organ of the Young Ukrainian Nationalists of America. Needless to say, that day has arrived. The seed which was planted as the Trident News has now grown into a young, sturdy oak. The Trident, and its roots will soon spread to all parts of the globe. It will be up to the youth, and to our elders, to see to it that the roots are well fed and supplied with wholesome nourishment; while it will be the duty of the staff to make certain that the results are worthwhile and that beautiful flowers blossom forth to cheer and enhearten the youth.",
                "We, the young Ukrainian Nationalists, present this first issue of The Trident to the Ukrainian Youth of America. It is our firm conviction that the American Ukrainian Youth have been awaiting that the arrival of a publication such as this; and we further believe that it will, in due time, unite the majority of the youth, so that they will shout in unison--\"Long Live Ukraine\".",
                "It would be worthwhile to reiterate the purpose of this magazine as expressed in the memorable first issue of the Trident News:",
                "\"1. To aquaint the youth with the ideals of Ukrainian Nationalism, and to create of this youth a strong force, one that will effectively aid the Ukrainian nation to free itself of foreign tyranny and set up its own free and independent state of Ukraine, by organizing our youth into the ranks of Y.U.N.",
                "\"2. To give the youth the necessary background of their heritage by presenting to them articles on Ukrainian History, Literature and folk lore, and to influence our youth to attend Ukrainian schools, sing in Ukrainian choruses, take part in Ukrainian theatricals, read Ukrainian Newspapers and books, and in general, manifest a greater interest in American-Ukrain-ian life.",
                "\"3. To conduct and intensify Ukrainian propaganda among other peoples, by encouraging the youth to participate in civic affairs in such a manner as to make the American public conscious of the fact that there exists in their community a Ukrainian people, that these people have a culture as high as their own, and that these people are trying to aid their appressed countrymen in Europe to regain their freedom\".",
                "If this publication can arouse the youth and cause them to cling to their priceless heritage, their mother tongue, one good purpose will have been achieved. But we cannot stop there!",
                "If this publication, further, can cause the youth to realize that in unity there is strength, and can foster a lasting interest in the youth in the welfare of their nation, so as to bring the youth closer together, as of one happy family, as of one indivisible nation, a higher purpose will have been attained. Finally, if this publication can stimulate the active interest of the youth in the Ukrainian cause--the liberation of Ukraine--then our supreme purpose will be accomplished.",
                "Let us, then consider briefly the intended policies of this magazine.",
                "It should be apparent to everyone that a publication such as this cannot long continue in popularity unless it has variety and sparkling life, so that the subscriber's interest will never lag, and unless it avoids being too controversial in regard to other organizations and publications. No further assurances are necessary that this magazine will retain the interest of its readers. This first issue is but a sample of its possibilities. On the other hand, it must be remembered that while at no time will unfair or cowardly attacks be made herein on any organization or its publication, yet where it shall be deemed necessary to pry open the unseeing eyes of the dormant or blind youth, the truth will be presented--not to satisfy any urge on our part to be maliciously trouble-some or provocative, but rather to prevent the youth from falling into pitfalls and errors which have in the past prevented our people from uniting as one nation to free Ukraine. We do not say that we will strive to avoid controversy, but we can say that we will avoid entering useless, harmful controversies and discussions. With this last word, we say, \"Do pobachenya,\" and \"Slava Ukraine!\""

With the exception of one volume written years before the war about the Ukrainians in America by a certain Dr. Julian Bachynsky, who at the time was visiting America, there is literally no history of us Ukrainians in America.

Let the person interviewed tell you all he knows. And put it down in writing. Your father, your mother, your uncle or godfather or any one will do. Ask them from which village of the old country they come, when and how they came and to what locality. Ask the parson (if there is any church in your or in the neighboring locality) when that church was built and by whom, who was the first pastor and his successors. Find out what organizations exist and by whom they were started. In a word, use your common sense and ingenuity in finding the history of your community and of the Ukrainians in it. You will be surprised how much knowledge you will derive from such an interview and how interesting it will be even for using it in your home papers.

The school is located at - 2254 North Mansfield Avenue, and the school meets three times a week, namely; - on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. The plan of teaching is as follows: Reading, and writing plainly in Ukrainian language, and beside that, athletic exercises, Ukrainian national dances, according to instructions of Auramenko, Ukrainian history, and Ukrainian folk songs. The teaching of religion is not considered to be a subject on the curriculum, because the parents of the evening school pupils, belong to different churches; to Catholic churches, and to Orthodox churches; and the teaching of religion is given to pupils at the church hall, to which their parents belong.",

Chmelnitsky Siege Branch No. 15 alone, including its two collateral groups of older women and the youth. When our youth is already so filled with firely love toward their misfortunate brothers that they are ready to give them aid and help to defend their people and their native land then our faith becomes far greater for a better and brighter future for our Ukrainian people and thereby we are much stronger and closer to the goal of freeing our nation from under the enemy's yoke.",

                "(1) The question about changed names: 98 persons answering that question said they did not change their names. The full name is usually adapted to the English pronunciation sometimes not very properly, for example: the proper name, Ivan, changed to John; Mikhaylo, to Mike; Hnat, to Jim, and so on. Only three businessmen of this number (98 persons) changed their names to English names, apparently from business reasons.",
                "The question whether the children who attend school have changed their names received no attention. This question is very important because the children use all their lives the names which were given to them by their teachers. By the names it is very easy to recognize how many Ukrainian students are attending high schools, colleges and universities. It is therefore very much desired that this question be filled out in the future.",
                "(2) The second question: Married or single: 82 persons answered \"yes,\" meaning they live in the married state, only 18 persons declared that they lead an unmarried life, out of that number three women, because they have no occasion to get married.",
                "(3) The citizenship papers: On one hundred questionaires there are 67 men who took out the second citizenship papers, 18 men took out the first citizenship papers and 15 men have no citizenship papers at all, besides the fact that many of these men have been here in America over twenty years. In reference to the women as the members of families, the matter is worse. Out of one hundred questionaires only 75 women have filled out the petitions for citizenship papers. It is evident that 23 women have already become citizens of the United States of America through being married to citizens."

To-day we have the honor of welcoming our esteemed guest, a Ukrainian soldier and a statesman, Dr. Joseph Nazaruk (thunderous applause), who will tell us in brief how our affairs stand in the Ukraine, and what we must do to go hand in hand with those across the ocean who are fighting for the Ukraine's freedom.\"",
                "The chairman introduced another no less esteemed guest, Mr. Alexander Koshets, conductor of the Ukrainian National Chorus, who was also present at the meeting. The entire audience enthusiastically greeted the master chorus-leader with three cheers.",
                "The Reverend W. Stetsiuk was the first speaker called upon by the chairman. Like another Chrysostom, he is one of the hardest local national workers. He greeted the Chicago Ukrainian colony with these words:",
                "\"This is our group! These are pearls; these are sincere earnest hard workers, who always and everywhere support the Ukrainian cause. They bought $11,000 worth of the Ukrainian victory bonds. They always support the Ukrainian Government, with Dr. E. Petrushevich as its President!\"",
                "The Reverend Mr. Stetsiuk in his speech encouraged those present to promote the work in the national field, and he sincerely thanked Dr. Joseph Nazaruk as well as Mr. A. Koshets for their visit among the Ukrainians in Chicago. He finished his speech with these words:",
                "\"Western Ukraine (Galicia) is on fire. Let it burn! Let it burn to the point where all the Poles shall be consumed, and from the ruins shall rise the golden freedom of the Ukraine!\"",
                "The next speaker on the program was Mr. A. Koshets, who in his short speech outlined his activity with the Ukrainian National Chorus. He remarked that even though his work is not of a political nature, it is propagandistic for the freedom of the Ukraine. Song awakens and will continue to awaken all the national life and will tell to strangers and to other nations who we are, and whose sons we are, said he. He finished with the words:",
                "\"I only wish that your voices could resound as mightily as the Ukrainian songs [themselves] resound with one general and great cry of desire: Freedom, freedom for the Ukraine!\"",
                "Now followed the speech of Dr. Joseph Nazaruk:",

It is due to your co-operation that today our cause is already placed on the daily schedule!\"",
                "He went on to give a sketch of the fight for Ukrainian independence by the Sitch soldiers, speaking so clearly and intelligibly that up to the present no Ukrainian Chicagoan has ever given to the public so vivid a history of our struggle. In his one-hour speech he practically hypnotized the audience so that they seemed ready to listen to his excellent discourse for a whole day. His words were so dynamic, eloquent, and true to life because he not only described something that he has seen but something for which he has fought, something which he has lived through, something for which he has shed his blood--Ukrainian independence.",
                "He gave the clear facts as to why the Western Ukrainian Government and its army did not unite with Petlura, why did they not unite with the communists, and why the Western Ukrainian army found itself under Denikin.",
                "\"Neither the Ukrainian army nor the Ukrainian Government in Galicia can be blamed for it. This Government as well as the whole Ukrainian nation has before it the single ideal and aim of one united great Ukraine.",
                "\"There, where Kiev stands, there our Western Ukrainian Government has its eyes fixed. There we want to have our central Government. This, and no other, is our aim! The ideal of every nation is to be united in one integral state, but occasionally, as in our case, circumstances do not permit it!",
                "\"If it be decreed that Western Ukraine and Great Ukraine are one, then, since Petlura agreed to cede Galicia to Poland, we should be apt to lose it, but as the matter stands, it is more advantageous for us. For our Western Ukrainian Government utterly rejected Petlura's move, and Poland today does not have as yet any claim upon Galicia.",
                "\"Why do we conduct all our political business outside the Ukraine? Because the enemies, who have occupied our country would not permit us to do anything of the sort on our own soil. Again, no country has won its independence since the world war except outside its own boundaries, i. e., abroad.",
                "\"The argument that our Government is not authoritative is false! \"Our Government in Western Ukraine is legal, lawful, and authoritative, because it was established while we were shedding our blood for Ukrainian independence. Those who think that by tearing down our Government they are favoring the Ukraine surely are making a mistake. They are injuring the Ukraine and thereby helping Poland.",
                "\"A fight is in the air! A fight is going on! Poland cannot stand such a fight any longer. She is failing before our very eyes. She will collapse.",
                "\"The time will come when the Ukrainian soldiers will be stationed in Warsaw and Cracow, even as now their soldiery is stationed on our Ukrainian soil!",
                "\"There is no nation to be found that is not against Poland, and our fight will cause the Polish state to perish!",
                "\"Our slogan is: Do not tear down the Ukrainian Government! By forming one front we help the Ukrainian Government. Our unanimous stand against Poland will drive her, our enemy, relentlessly away from our soil!",
                "\"In the United States we already have the United Insurance to which all our organizations belong, including the Sitch organization with its headquarters in Chicago. Those five letters in the word 'Sitch' are our much-prized slogan! This is the organization which all should join. Such an organization as Sitch should shine above all other organizations because its existence is the most opportune at the present time. All should understand that it is the duty of the Sitch to help the fighters beyond the seas. It is the duty of the Sitch organization to give help to our waiting army there!",
                "\"In the name of the Western Ukrainian Government, in the name of its parliament, in the name of you all, brothers and sisters here beyond the seas, I appeal to you most ardently to help our fight in Galicia against Poland!",
                "\"Do not throw stones at the Western Ukrainian Government, which has no stain upon its name but is honorable and economical and in every respect faithfully performs its duty. Our Government is built upon charred ruins, and in this same condition it still exists! Our good fortune was [then] knocking at our door and continues to knock! There is still time for us to achieve this good fortune; therefore help to support your Government!\"",
                "Thus finishing his speech, he thanked the Chicago colony for its work on behalf of its nation. Thundering and long-continued ovations followed as the reward of the grandiloquent speech of Dr. Nazaruk from the enthusiastic, inspired, and uplifted audience.",
                "There were a few Reds in the hall, but they sat quietly, knowing that this mass meeting was under the auspices of the Sitch organization. One of the Reds merely ventured to propound a few questions written out on paper, silly questions, of course, which Dr. Nazaruk answered briefly, and for which Comrade Red received a loud \"Boo!\"",
                "The next speaker was Dr. S. K. Hrynevetsky, chief executive of the Sitch organization. This generous, determined Cossack pays no attention to impediments but goes wherever Ukrainians live with the slogans: \"To action!\" and \"Join the Sitch!\" He has not only showed us his generosity in words; he has also proved by his actions that he has the Ukrainian cause deeply at heart. He appealed to the audience for the so-called \"Immediate Fund.\" After his terse speech his listeners began to approach the desks of the secretaries of the meeting with their contributions to the fund.",
                "During this time the elderly Dr. W. Siminovich, in his feeling style, appealed to all to unite in action and in contributing for the national needs. He was quite interesting, for although he is old in years, he is still young in spirit and eager to work and to fight for the freedom of the Ukraine.",
                "Next was Nicholas Thatchuk, the son of flowery Bukovina. His speech also was full of feeling. He surely practices what he preaches, for he is a staunch member of Sitch. For this he deserves recognition.",
                "Then Joseph Kotsovsky spoke. He, as a good patriot, sacrifices everything possible for the national cause; in particular, money is of no consequence to him when it is a question of doing something for the national cause. He won the approval of all by his speech, and everybody enjoyed it because he explained himself in plain language. He is of the practical type and believes more in deeds than in useless, empty phrases.",
                "The money collected was sent directly to Dr. S. Stotsky. For the \"Immediate Fund\" $668.75 was contributed. A list of the contributors will be published in the next issues of the Sitch News.",
                "A few months ago Dr. Luke Myshuga received from Chicago a check for $1,000 signed by Dr. S. K. Hrynevetsky. Up to the present the contributions to cover the check have amounted to $721.25. Therefore $278.75 was added to this sum from the collection that was made at this mass meeting; an additional $390 was set aside as an installment on another $1,000 to be sent to the Ukrainian Government.",
                "In Dr. L. Myshuga's stay in Chicago, at the confidential meeting of the few leaders of Chicago, $73 more was contributed, which was also sent to the \"Immediate Fund.\"",
                "In short, the Chicago Ukrainian colony has contributed to the \"Immediate Fund\" up to the present time $1,462.",
                "Telegrams of protest were sent to Bonar Law, premier of England, to the League of Nations in Switzerland, and to the American Secretary of State, Mr. Hughes.",

                "In your letter of August 8, we learn that a Siege Organization was established in the United States, and you have inquired of us as to the necessity of it and its ultimate end. I think that every Ukrainian, myself included, sympathizes with the fate of our people who are fighting for their independence, and therefore, jointly with the Ukrainian nation. I can give you just this one answer that we accept with sincerest joy, the good tidings of your having established this organization. It is not only remarkable from the national point of view that our people still continue to cultivate the Siege ideals for an independence of Ukrainia, but also that they are ready to give up their lives to fight for it to the finish. It is our duty to see to it that each and everyone of us belongs to this organization, especially at this moment when our brothers and sisters across the ocean are suffering so bitterly under the yoke of the enemy. It is in the interest of our fight for independence that one and all should join the organization.",
                "This organization, more than any other, can awaken and strengthen our hopes; arouse in us national sentiment, power, and right and thereby help our motherland. Through such an organization as Siege, we become invincible in fighting for what belongs to Ukrainia.",
                "Then only will the world notice that winning independence truly requires the whole nation, and practically everybody should be soldiers.",
                "Then will the world see our strength, our discipline, and order.",
                "Only with an organization of Ukrainians, both in the native land and abroad, can our capable nation lead itself to a better destiny without any outside foreign interference which our people should never suffer.",
                "Only then our voice will not be lost in the desert; only then even our enemies will respect us.",
                "Only then our nation will be able to conquer everything, whatever the will of a powerful, well-organized, great nation wants. The nation can win its freedom and independence only then, when every individual will answer the call to join the Siege organization.",
                "No nation has ever won its freedom merely with diplomats and the endeavors of a scanty group of politicians, without the simultaneously determined support of the whole nation.",
                "The Ukrainian nation in Eastern Galicia understood it, and therefore, thanks to its already established organizations now has a chance to give much proof that they do not want and will not allow themselves, for any length of time, to suffer under a foreign yoke.",
                "But even in the United States the organization is not carried out to its utmost by the very fact that it does not include the whole group of our people so that there would not be a single Ukrainian left outside the organization. This present occupation of the Western part of Ukrainia by Poland, causes impediments and even impossibilities in the direction of freedom, to continue the work in that part of the country. All the more that the organizations of our people in America, country of freedom in which our brother emigrants can do so much, since they have greater freedom to organize than they ever had in Galicia while under Austria. The Siege Organization in the United States, strong as it is, is as yet in its very inception. The consolation, however, is that it is growing stronger and stronger. In it, I notice people who work with considerable sacrifice, great political understanding and their main ideal is to work for the complete success of the organization. They understand its vehement value and therefore are trying to put it into practice. For now, during this intensely opportune time such an organization when well organized may render a great help to the native land. The country needs your help, and the most significant help will be given only then, when it comes from the collective will of the whole emigration; this is possible and most effective only through the means of such an organization as this.",
                "Irishmen, Germans and Czechs, etc., had such organizations among them a long time ago. With the exception of the Ukrainian insurance companies, we, up to the present time, do not have a single organization which would include all the political parties and faiths under one slogan: For the freedom of the Ukrainian nation.",
                "It is useless to mention what an important part, in fighting for the freedom of their nation, and in the building of their State, the Czech Eagles played and are still playing in political life.",
                "We could have done better in the past. We should have been as alert as they were. Yet, it is never too late to mend, and it should be mended as soon as possible.",
                "Therefore, I accept this news with joy that an organization already exists which stands above the political parties, in the form of The Ukrainian Siege Organization in the United States.",
                "This will uplift in spirit and give further inspiration and strength to the fighters for freedom in the native land, when they can see that behind them stands another skirmish line of fighters.",
                "I am convinced that all the Ukrainians in America of both sexes will understand the Siege Organization as a national necessity and will take it as one of their first duties to become one of its members as soon as possible.",

To you, highly esteemed doctor, who has done so much and is still continuing to do everything in your power for the organization, thereby doing your full share to help the Ukrainian nation in its hard struggle for liberation from the yoke of slavery, to you especially goes true and sincere thanks and congratulations for all your special efforts in this direction.",

                "Ukrainians from every nook of America write articles to newspapers telling the world about their local activities, relations with their homeland, etc. In short, everyday we are learning about some of their worthwhile activities from many parts of this country.",
                "In Chicago, as elsewhere, our people are also earnest workers in many branches of various activities, including national. Yet, curious enough, the newspapers do not mention anything about Chicago at all. In view of this fact, I was determined to write something about the Ukrainian concert which took place in Chicago, wherein the local Siege was host to the famous Ukrainian Choirs; therefore, in a measure the Chicago Ukrainians directly and indirectly contributed to the entertainment of different nationalities of Chicago, who were present at the concert. Here everybody had an opportunity to enjoy the real beauty of Ukrainian melodies and dances.",
                "Chicago, both this year and last year, presented a small exhibition, Pageant of Progress Exposition. Of course, at this exposition practically all nationalities and all kinds of products were represented. The exposition this year was quite favorable to the Ukrainians, and the Chicago Ukrainians were certain to take advantage of it.",
                "The exposition opened on July 29, with a grand pageant of numerous musical bands and demonstrations of all sorts of products. Our Chicago Siege band, composed of forty players, with its conductor John Barabash, was one of those numerous bands. \"Ukrainian Band,\" both in Ukrainian and English, was inscribed on its large drum. They made such a good appearance, that they surely must have attracted the attention of the crowd of a million people standing packed on both sides of the streets, because as our band passed there were ceaseless ovations and cheers from the crowd. This was one of the first grand and successful appearances of our Siege Band which will have a lasting impression on a million inhabitants of Chicago. This was an appearance which informed the American public that there are Ukrainians living in Chicago. In a great measure we have John Barabash, our young Siege Band conductor to thank for all this.",
                "The exposition, as mentioned above began on July 29, and was to end August 13. The Ukrainians were invited to give their concert on the last day. No one ever dreamed of such an opportunity. One week had already passed and no one knew anything about it; naturally, no one was interested any further, to any considerable extent, with the exposition. But as the second week commenced, the incredible good news was received from the Exposition Committee that the Chicago Ukrainians had been selected to give the Grand Finale Concert on the last day of the Exposition.",
                "Within a few hours the Ukrainian Concert Committee got together, discussed the matter, and decided on concert numbers.",
                "The leading members of this Committee were the following: John Barabash, conductor of the Ukrainian Siege Band; Rev. Wasyl Stetsiuk, conductor of the Siege male choir; Professor T. Choptiak, conductor of the Lysenko choir; R. I. Smook; and Mr. Aschenko, instructor of the Unrainian national dances.",
                "From that time on the tireless work began. Both choirs rehearsed most diligently, and the girls also wanted to profit by the opportunity so they were glad to learn Ukrainian group dances. All rehearsals and preparations for the concert took place at the Church Hall, at Oakley and Rice St. The culminating point of all those rehearsals of the band, choirs, etc., was reached on the day of the concert.",
                "The concert was announced in all the American newspapers in Chicago. And curious enough, the Poles were very much surprised. They wondered why the Ukrainians were chosen, and most likely they sent their spies to the concert.",
                "Critics, reporters of foreign newspapers, as well as many Ukrainians were present at the concert.",
                "William Hale Thompson, Mayor of Chicago, and one of the members of the Exposition Committee, because of the lack of seats in the hall were obliged to listen to the concert over the radio.",
                "Now I wish to lay aside the description of the audience and the concert hall, and will start first, so to speak, with a slight criticism of the musical numbers.",
                "The first number was the overture \"Lustspiel\" by Keller Bello. The parting of the curtain disclosed a beautiful tableau of a Ukrainian Siege band wearing blue uniforms.",
                "R. Smook, the prompter, introduced the Ukrainian Band and its conductor John Barabash, and announced the first number of the program. They were given a real welcome by a lengthy ovation.",
                "As the conductor raised his baton such silence prevailed that the drop of a pin could have been heard. The beautiful \"Lustspiel\" was played with minute precision.",
                "Everyone, who has ever heard the piece and understands music, discovered that the men in the Ukrainian Band, not only play skillfully, but also with their whole hearts and souls.",
                "The second part of the first number was the serenade \"The Cupid Charms.\" The third part, \"Collection of Ukrainian Melodies,\" by John Barabash, was excellently played by the band.",
                "The second number was a song, the \"Bandoora,\" by H. Davidovsky. Another beautiful tableau was then presented, composed of members of M. Lyssenko's mixed choir.",
                "Then followed the choir of T. Choptiak. Both choirs had to sing encores. Miss Mary Vinyarsky deserves honorable mention because of her very charming soprano voice.",
                "Third number: \"Wedding of the Winds,\" music by J. T. Hall. Also \"Ukrainian Bazaar Songs,\" by John Barabash.",
                "After a short intermission the Ukrainian Band appeared again. The audience was so pleased with the band that it seemed that it could not want anything better, yet this band is comprised mostly of persons from the laboring class.",
                "In the last part of the third number the Ukrainian Band played Ukrainian compositions exclusively. This deviation from American music was a real treat to the audience. The band was called back over and over; the enthusiastic audience hardly knew when to stop its ovations.",
                "The fourth number: \"Vetchernitsi\" (Evening Entertainment), music by R. T. Nischinsky. The very appearance of the self-confident M. Lyssenko's mixed choir was a certain guarantee that this number would be a success. This it was, although in minor details there was still room for improvement. But if the fact that the choirs also consist of the working class is taken into consideration, then one is bound to marvel at how it was possible for these amateurs to render their numbers as well as they did.",
                "Another attraction was the young ladies in Ukrainian national costumes. Several of the girls were so immaculately dressed that they looked like a real tableau. Miss Olga Motsio was one of them. It looked as if those girls had come from Ukrainia to entertain the audience here, and to show American women how beautifully they dress in Ukrainia.",
                "The fifth number: Mr. and Mrs. Aschenko presented a short dialogue and excerpts from songs. It was not bad, but it seems that it would have been much better if it had been omitted entirely.",
                "The sixth number: The popular song \"Palley,\" musical master-piece of T. Vorobkevich. When the curtain was drawn, the public witnessed a slightly different treat, a male choir. This was a Siege choir and its conductor Rev. Wasyl Stetsiuk, a sincere, zealous hard worker. The choir, under his direction was being swayed with the rapidity of lightning, yet so smoothly and so harmoniously. The American public has never seen a better choir, a choir so well-disciplined and with such seriousness in their hearts for the work at hand. This number, of all the choir numbers, was the most successful. This choir was a living testimonial of the hard work of Rev. W. Stetsiuk. All we have to say, with reference to this Siege male choir, is to hope that they will continue to attend their rehearsals in the future under their very able conductor Rev. W. Stetsiuk.",
                "The seventh number: Solo and group dances were preceded by a song by a group of girls. The dances were another covetous treat for the audience. Boys and girls poured on the stage from the right and left sides formed couples, ranks, and files. With very skillful musicians the ballets came out exceptionally well.",
                "The group was followed by solo dances. This was something positively new for the audience. The following took part in it: Mr. Aschenko, instructor and manager of the dancing of the program; Stephen Musiychuk, true cossack and sincere worker in the Siege Organization; M. Tokarevich; D. Zabolotsky; Luke Stachursky. They all performed their parts very well, yet Mr. Aschenko, as could be expected, superseded them all. He is a superb ballet master and acrobatic dancer, and naturally, he would be master of the situation.",
                "Of all the girls who danced exceptionally well, several of them deserve special press attention. Among those were the following: A. Voos, O. Motsio, Mrs. M. Musiychuk, Catherine Kosovich, Mary Vinyarsky, S. Koptynsky, and Kryvetsky.",
                "The eighth number: The overture \"Superbe,\" by Dalbey, was played by the band as well as their preceding pieces.",
                "For the grand finale the Ukrainian Band played the American and Ukrainian national anthems.",
                "We are sure that this concert will never be forgotten by the American audience and still more so by the Ukrainians who were present.",
                "Two days have passed since the grand fete, after which, very desirable results have followed. The secretary of the Exposition sent an official letter to our Ukrainian Concert Committee in which, among other things, he stated that the Concert given by the Ukrainians was the most sensational event of the whole Exposition. The letter was signed by Mayor William Hale Thompson and his secretary.",
                "The day after this letter was received, special delegates sent by the Exposition executives, came to the Ukrainian Concert Committee and asked them to repeat the concert once more. However, they declined the offer due to some important reason that intervened.",
                "It seems that it is useless to comment any further on the fact that the Chicago Ukrainians did more by that one concert, than they could by many protests against their political enemies.",
                "And now, for the grand success of this concert, we should give thanks to John Barbabash, conductor of the Ukrainian Band, and to the chairman of the Ukrainian Concert Committee.",
                "Our next obligation is to Rev. Wasyl Stetsiuk, Prof. T. Choptiak, and ballet master Aschenko and his wife. They all co-operated very well.",
                "We should also thank the subordinates who answered the call of their conductors with such enthusiasm. Thanks for their sincerely impersonal interest in the concert's success.",
                "Would to God that we continue to be as successful in the future.",

During this silence every one should think and strongly desire independence for Urkrainia. Then the national anthem should follow.",

                "In view of the fact that there arose a big misunderstanding among the chief executives of the Siege Organization that threatens to break up the whole organization, the district Siege committee of Chicago and suburbs, together with Mr. Peter Didyk, who is chief organizer for the organization, Mr. Bohdan Skrotsky, chief financial secretary, and Mr. Nicholas Moronetz, chief treasurer, called on Mar. 28th a general meeting of the nine branches that exist here. There in the general discussions they came to the following conclusion:",
                "The executive committee should be together in one locality, that is to say, not coming from Chicago, but from the recording head secretary, Mr. Peter Zadoretsky in New York. This move was written in a letter to Mr. Nicholas Moranetz, on Feb. 14, 1920. There he states that the executive committee should be either in New York or Chicago. If the executive committee is in Chicago, he states he will gladly give up his post for the good of the organization.",
                "Further, according to the correspondence written by Mr. Zadoretsky, the chief executive, the three other members on the committee saw fit to call a general district meeting, in order to consult the whole Siege organization in this important case.",
                "At the general meeting, after a short discussion, all the members agreed upon that for the good of the organization the executive committee must be in one locality.",
                "Right there we stopped to consider whether or not we would be able to take all the Siege work to Chicago if a majority of its members would approve of it. We considered our strength and saw that we have nine branches with about eight hundred members. We said, we can pick out a good editorial committee for the Seige News, which has to publish the newspaper on time without any cost. We do not think it expedient that every member of the executive committee should be from Chicago, but only the majority of it, so that the work would go faster.",
                "We did not intend to take over the jurisdiction of the commander-in-chief, Mr. Boyko, nor that of the centurion nor the assistant centurions; we only wanted to keep the working people mostly for the good of the Siege Organization.",
                "As a result of this discussion we notified the head commander, Mr. Boyke, asking him to notify all the Siege members in the United States, so that they would vote as to where the executive offices of the Siege Organization are to be transfered.",
                "In return, Mr. Boyko resolved the matter in this way. Not waiting for the results of the voting, he ordered the chief treasurer to send all the books, and figures, and all the work of the head secretary to him before Mar. 30th. All this was done under false pretenses. He himself complains, and he himself does the judging - absolutely by himself. We shall state here the false movements of the head commander.",
                "First: He says that the by-laws were issued too late. The answer to it is like this. A few months for preparing and printing the by-laws is not too long, and we know it for a fact that no organization is able to do this faster. We must add that the by-laws were being prepared for five months, and laid in New York a whole month, through the negligence of the committee.",
                "Second: The same thing applies to the publishing of the Siege guide. Let the members look to how many rubrics there are in it, let them understand that this is altogether a new thing. Those that undertook the making of the by-laws and the Siege guide likely did not expect any criticism, but only an acknowledgement for their fast and true work.",
                "Third: As to the treasurer, the head commander accuses Mr. Moranetz, that he did not want to send money for the Siege News. Every Siege member must remember that Mr. Boyko made a motion at the Siege convention that there should be two seperate treasuries: one for the Siege organization, and the other for the Siege News. That is why the chief treasurer did not see fit, without first consulting all the members, to give the money from the main treasury to the treasury of the Siege News. The executive committee does not have the least idea as to how much money came in for the Siege News nor what was given out. We know that Mr. Zadosetsky and Mr. Bentoniak figured out that one issue would cost $80. Yet, at the convention on Jan. 18, 1920, we found out that besides the subscribers, over $300 of the Christmas Carol money was given for the Siege News. A few hundred dollars was supposed to come from subscriptions. All this money did not cover two issues of the Siege News. Mr. Moranety borrowed $50 from the treasury, and again there is not enough, everyone is \"squawking\" because the treasurer does not want to give out any more money.",
                "It is a fact that the extraordinary convention, which Mr. Boyko called in January, really ruined the treasury of the organization, whereby there is hardly enough to pay for the by-laws and the guide. We, Siege members, now wish for a thorough statement of the administration of the Siege News in order to find out, where and when that large sum of money was expended.",
                "The editors of the Ukraina are sorely disappointed that the head commander judges this newspaper rashly.",
                "Fourth: It was also decided that we must also stand in defense of this independent newspaper Ukraina, which always sympathizes with us, backs us and and will further back up the Siege movement.",
                "Ukraina never belittled the Siege News, but only turned our attention to the fact that the editors allowed a disloyal article concerning the national rights of the Ukrainian Republic to be published.",
                "We, Siege members, at the same time must be loyal to Ukrainia and its national government until death. Ukraina pointed out from the start that the editors of the Siege News made a mistake and that mistake will surely be criticized by the Siege members.",
                "This is the way it happened:- Today there is no blot on the Siege Organization, no disloyal accusations, due to the watchfullness of the newspaper Ukraina.",
                "Taking all this into consideration, we came to this conclusion, that the accusations of the head commander are not in any way proven.",
                "We move for the good of the Organization, that the head commander announce a Siege convention not later than sometime in April, 1920, somewhere between Chicago and New York, and we think the most suitable place would be the city of Cleveland, in which there is a strong branch of the Siege Organization.",
                "It is better to lose a few hundred dollars than to lose this important Siege movement in America-- economy in this respect would be out of place. We, Siege members, who wish to make the greatest contribution for our Fatherland, do not fear to pitch in a dollar or two for the good of the national cause.",
                "We expect that all the Siege members will back us up in this important case, from which will result not only the good of the Siege Organization, but the good of the national cause in America. We cannot remedy any matter through w writing alone. We must stand at the convention, and put up the proposition as clearly as possible, so that everyone will see what is needed for the good of the Siege movement and our nation.",
                "We do not wish to see divisions and scattering of the Siege, but a spreading of the Siege spirit far and wide from ocean to ocean and beyond.",
                "It is not the will of any individual to lead the Siege Organization, but the will of all the Siege members, and the executives' work is only to carry out the will of all the members. No one is permitted to break the national will.",
                "We do not want anything but the truth, peace and sociable cooperation of all the Siege members.",

It established a school for the illiterate, so that they may profit by the long winter evenings, and thus entirely eliminate illiteracy from our branch. All those who do not know how to read and write decided to begin to study with great earnestness, so as to learn at least the most elementary things by the next Spring.

In such a school a Siege member can profit in two ways: (1) By acquiring knowledge and fearlessness, and thus being able, if need be to get up with a speech at a meeting or convention, and (2) Should any Siege member go back to his native land, he would be able to become a leader in a Ukrainian community, either in his native village or in another town.",

If children are healthy, so will be the nation, and this applies to any nation. Let us turn our attention to ourselves. Who of us ever thought of the blessings brought about by athletics? It has been over thirty years since our immigration started into this country, and nobody has ever mentioned anything seriously about athletics yet. All of us seem to look at it indifferently, although there are many who know that for us Ukrainians it is indispensably necessary; yet during all that time they did not do anything in this direction. Meanwhile, our youth, feeling the necessity of physical drill, joined clubs hostile to us, for the sake of gymnastics. This is why today we find a number of Ukrainians in the ranks of the Polish Eagle organization. They speak Polish as fluently as if they did not know their native language or neglected it. And today we complain that our Ukrainians read Polish newspapers and speak their language, but we do not try to find the cause of this evil, and even though we see it, we are ashamed to tell ourselves the truth straight from the shoulder, that this is our own fault.",

So, if we had undertaken that work right from the start, then today, positively we would exceed twice 500,000 immigrants, for we emigrated in a far greater number than they actually give us credit for. Alas, many foreign elements unjustly claim any number of Ukrainina immigrants. To counteract this situation at least in part, we established the Siege Organization, which has for its object the training of the Ukrainian Youth, both physically and spiritually. Everyone of us already know that in a sound body there is a sound mind.",

                "Thanks to the Interim Sitch Committee, the first Sitch convention was called on November 11, 1916, in New York City, and from almost everywhere in the United States, delegates from Ukrainian organizations and associations rallied to establish the Ukrainian Sitch Organization in the United States.",
                "According to Sitch custom, the convention at that time elected the following Sitch officers: Head Commander, M. Rybak, Philadelphia, Pa.; Circuit Commander, V. Serbey, Allentown, Pa.; Assistant Circuit Commander, P. Zadoretsky, New York City; Secretaries, L. Stachursky, Jersey City, N. J.; V. Koval, Philadelphia, Pa.",
                "These officers were entrusted with leading the Sitch organization, and they publicly declared upon their honor that they would rather die than stray from or become lax in, the duties placed upon them. From the zeal and sincere determination of that sparkling youth, one could easily conclude that there was no power in the world which could stop them from their work in the Sitch field.",
                "With gladness and satisfaction, the delegates parted with full persuasion and firm faith that in the near future the Sitch bugle would blow, the strawberry-colored banner would be hoisted, hatchet and canes would flash, and simultaneously with this, our youth would wake up from their slumber to a better life, which will start its ant-like work in the Sitch field all over America.",
                "It has been almost two years since the Sitch organization was established. Just a few swore to be faithful to the Sitch cause. Yet, outside all the impediments on the part of our own and foreigners (for it is a known fact that Sitch organization does not appeal to everybody), the Sitch movement in America did not perish, but on the contrary, recently proved to be greater than ever.",
                "Up to the present time, the following independent Sitch athletic branches joined the main Sitch organization:",

They further believe that the Sitch branches will support our work with all their might.

Yet in the end, mainly under the influence of Father Nicholas Strutynsky and a few other intelligent people, there followed agreement, in a way that the \"Ukrainian Council\" gave to the members of the \"Federation\" their tags and in return they were given the collection boxes,--and finally they all agreed to work together for the good of their people.",
                "The District Committee of the \"Federation\" undertook to see to it that everything is done to put over the \"Ukrainian Day\" successfully. Madam Strutynsky, Messrs. Kowalsky, Strusevich and Osadovsky, personally worked hard in the organization preparing everything needed for the \"Ukrainian Day.\"",
                "They applied for help from the Lithuanians, Poles, and even went from house to house collecting from their own as well as from others.",
                "We must sincerely thank our girls and women that worked ardently on this day, collecting money from the passing people in the streets.",
                "The committee recommended that Dr. Vladimir Siemenovich and Mr. Strusevich take care of the exterior arrangement of the \"Ukrainian Day.\"",
                "They arranged for the announcement of the \"Ukrainian Day\" in American newspapers as much as possible. Thus, all the Chicago papers carried more or less spacious articles. The Chicago Herald even carried an extensive article, stating the present situation and the desire of the Ukrainians for their freedom and independence; so did the Chicago American. Once more did the poetess and writer, Madam Laflin, publish a sketch from the life of a poor Ukrainian family in a very sympathetic spirit.",
                "Mr. M. Sichynsky and Dr. Siemenovich undertook to request the aldermen, to permit the collecting of money in the streets of Chicago. So a full success was obtained.",
                "Notwithstanding the fact that Father Nicholas Strutynsky was opposing the independent Church for a long time past, yet during this day he allowed both the parishes to hold a meeting of all the Ukrainians in the hall of his Church. This we should be thankful for to him since from that time on both the parties started a mutual understanding.",
                "The income from the \"Ukrainian Day\" up till now was $8,353.68, from the \"Federations\" alone; as to the amount collected by the \"Ukrainian Council,\" I could not find out, but I think that it did not exceed a few hundred dollars; --this however, is quite satisfactory.",
                "The Chicago American Committee gathered more than $1,300.00 which was added to the whole amount. In this a $1,000.00 check came from a Chicago millionaire, Paten. The Pullman Company sent a separate $50.00 check straight to the Ukrainian \"Federation\" in New York.",
                "From the above mentioned amount, we have yet to pay the expenses, but for these expenses a separate collection is being held.",
                "We must state that the Poles as well as the Lithuanians, backed us considerably, for they sent their girls for the collections;--and the Lithuanians even established a separate committee for themselves and collected nearly $600.00 for the Ukrainians. The exact amount of the offerings and collections will be announced in the following issue of the Ukraina. The \"Ukrainian Day\" brought a great moral profit to the Ukrainians as a whole, besides the material aid."

Before long, Ukraine again fell under the control of her enemies.",

At this sermon he promised his excellency that the whole U.H.O. of the St. Nicholas Parish would take communion. His promise, as everyone who attended mass last Sunday at 8:00 A.M. knows, was carried out. Company 3 (the newly organized company, consisting of young boys ranking from 16 to 19 years of age) was there a hundred percent. Everyone accepting communion in their uniforms. Much color was added to the scene by the Blue and Gold capes. Other companies were also represented, although the uniform representation was a trifle smaller percentage.",

While the refreshments were being served he was asked by Okruzni Ataman Nicholas Moranets to give a little talk. His excellency accepted, saying that this occassion really called for a long talk (that is if he really was to express his feeling in full) but due to the fact that the high mass was to start in a short time he would make it brief. He said that he was happy to serve mass and give communion to all the U.H.O. members. He also told of a similar case in Canada, at which everyone; doctors, lawers, engineers and communion together.",

He, in his talk, thanked his excellency for giving communion to all the U.H.O. members and also stressed the point that without God, Ukraine shall never live. If every Ukrainian went to communion, it wouldn't be long before the Ukrainian Flag would be carried along by the side of others. At the present time it is carried by us but does not stand for an independent country as others do. Our's stands for a country striving for it's independence. The only way it can free itself is through God. As many of you might have read in a series of articles on the famine in Ukraine about a starving woman, when asked of what she thought, she replied, that she would want the Hetman back. As you can readily see, even though she was starving she still had God, and her country in mind. She knew that with the hetman, our country would survive.",
                "Later company 3 members were presented by Okruzni Ataman, N. Moranets with bars of merit for their services last year in guarding the Holy Sepulcher. The following received the bars of merit: Capt. N. Matviuw, Serg. M. Dytko, E. Masowick, M. Tymush, J. Prietula, and P. Wojciechowski. I am sure every one of those bars were earned by everyone and here's hoping that they will earn many more.

Mr. Stephen Musiychuk, the Secretary-General, read the special documents and handed them to the Chief Ataman as well as to the district leaders. Then Mr. Musiychuk read the special communications of the district managements, and, while delivering a truncheon into the hands of the Chief Ataman, pronounced these words: \"With this truncheon we place into your hands the fate of our organization. This truncheon is not made of gold and is not covered with gems, but we believe that some day our Ukraine shall be free, and then this truncheon shall shine too, as was prophesied by Shevchenko:",

                "During the last few words, the truncheon rested in the hands of the Chief Ataman, Dr. Stephen Hrynevetsky--the chorus thundered the song \"Glory, glory, Ataman!\" With tears in his eyes, Dr. Hrynevetsky expressed his appreciation by assuring the audience that the truncheon belonged, not to him, but to a legitimate Hetman of Ukraine. Then he reaffirmed his word with a solemn oath and administered the oath to all the district leaders. He also nominated Rev. Father F. Tarnawsky as chaplain of the organization.",
                "The celebration was terminated with songs by a male chorus of seventy-five members, under the leadership of Mr. D. Atamanets."

                "The Chicago Siege took part in the American manifestation on September 12. The Siege, in their uniforms, made such a splendid and impressive appearance that the parade committee had the Ukrainian local Siege march ahead of the entire American manifestation. We believe that this was one of the finest affairs that the Ukrainians had ever had in Chicago. There were over 1,000 Siege members who took part in it. The Ukrainian women wore their national costumes; a group of them wore Siege uniforms. With them were also four priests, numerous businessmen, and especially laborers. The full splendor of uniforms showed their meaning. Without them the Siege would have been practically lost in the massive manifestation of the Americans, and, as a matter of fact, no one would have noticed the Ukrainians. But as it was, the Ukrainian flags were carried at the head of the parade, together with American flags.",
                "In a few months there will be a new American holiday to which our Siege will again be invited. It is imperative that those who still do not as yet have their own uniforms get them as soon as possible, so that a still greater number may be able to join the American parade, and together with the already uniformed members, jointly as a Ukrainian unit, again add to the splendor of the American parade. Write-ups, on such occasions, in American newspapers about us will do us more good than if we paid for it.",
                "We also wish to add that thirty-six miles out of Chicago, in Gary, Indiana, the local Siege branch No. 12, on this same day, September 12, took part in the American parade held there. The American press made good comments about them."

                "Branch No. 15, which considers itself independent is composed particularly of the Catholic St. Nicholas parishioners at Oakley Blvd. and Rice St., and acted independently with the possible intention of injuring the program of the general Siege celebration.",
                "Despite this disharmony the celebrants were very numerous in our general holiday. The majority of sincere Chicago Ukrainians remember the main Ukrainian cause and not the petty affairs of a single group whose members regard the general Ukrainian business too narrowly, and look after the good of their parish only.",
                "At 3 P.M. the hall was filled with Siege members from various districts: Hammond, Gary, Cicero, Joliet, Chicago, Burnside, South Side, West Side, North Side, and even from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. There were some non-members too, who are sincere Ukrainians, and came down for a joint-celebration to honor and glorify the fallen heroes of Ukrainia.",
                "With silent, yet intense sympathy, the gathering reverently awaited the opening of the concert of the festival, and while meditating on the past beyond the ocean, in Ukrainia, they were comparing it with the present times, both over there and here, when the commencement of the concert interrupted their thoughts.",
                "With the rising of the curtain, in the middle of the stage there was a grave mound covered with green and a wooden cross reminding those present of the countless fresh graves strewn throughout Ukrainian valleys, meadows, and the lonely steppes. This sight was enough to make the people's expressions grave. There were sighs of longing, and even drops of tears could have been perceived on many of those present.",
                "The celebration was opened by the district colonel Mr. M. Saragun, with a short, yet sincere introductory speech after which followed music by the musical society \"Free Cossacks,\" Directed by Mr. John Kobeliak, the national anthem, \"Ukrainia Has Arisen,\" was played.",
                "Mr. P. Novodvorsky's lecture was next on the program. He briefly reviewed the great historical deeds from the Cossacks' period to the present time.",
                "The number following was \"A Bundle of Ukrainian Songs\" played by the musical club \"Free Cossacks,\" after which followed the number, \"Honor To The Heroes.\"",
                "During the first part of the ceremony, the choir of the Young Boyan, directed by Mr. K. Pendik, sang \"You Fell Through Sacrifice, after which a twelve-year old girl, Miss Stephania Motsio, dressed in a typical Ukrainian costume, recited in her ringing voice a short poem in honor of the fallen heroes, placing on the grave a wreath from the Ukrainian colony in Chicago. Also Mr. Wasylovsky placed a wreath from the Self-educating club. This ended the tribute to the fallen heroes. During the ceremony all those who were present stood up.",
                "The next number, a collection of Ukrainian songs, was sung by the Young Boyan. Then followed a well given recitation of one of Taras Shevchenko's poems, \"Haydamaky\" (Knights) by Stephen Musiychuk. Dr. John Smuk's Eulogy was next and suited the occasion.",
                "The choir of the Young Boyan sang \"I Slanderized,\" with a soloist Mr. P. Dmytrash, taking the lead.",

This is not so, he has only become its first real executive, particularly where the interest of the organization requires it. Already at the Convention, in the matter regarding financial secretaries, the Chief Executive agreed to their election, and the only thing he reserved for himself was his approval of them. There is a twofold benefit out of it: 1) The organization will have confidence in the financial secretaries elected and approved by him; 2) In case of necessity, the Chief Executive will have the power to immediately stop any disorder or irregularity and order a new election of them or of any other officer.",

Tactful and prudent officers should always listen to the ideas and thoughts of the most highly respected members, and good members should always respect their superiors and officers, even though their ideas may differ, or not coincide with the opinion of the masses. Thus we shall be able to build a great and powerful organization, which in turn will become an example of unity and discipline for the whole Ukrainian Nation.

One of the changes will be that the Chief Executive must appoint all the officers, with the exception of those whom he thinks ought to be elected by their respective District or Branch. In case of the death or the resignation of the Chief Executive, his assistant will take full charge of the Office. And in case the latter can not continue in the Office, he has the right to appoint an Interim Chief Executive, until the next referendum. The manner in which the Chief Executive is to be elected will depend upon the latest amended by-laws. This amendment is done according to the leading thoughts of the speech on the by-laws, at every Siege Convention, and according to the five articles in the Siege Organ, under the title: \"Let us Build a Strong Siege.\" The Chief Executive is to hold the Office for three years. All the other officers are his subordinates, and they are either directly appointed, or approved by him. After the three years are over, he must call a convention, at which the delegates will either re-elect the old, or elect a new Chief Executive. The Convention must appraise and approve, or otherwise, the work of the Officers in power for the past three years.",
                "The Chief Executive once elected for three years, can be deposed only by a referendum, that is, by a general voting of every Siege member, and when two-thirds of all the Branches and within each Branch, two-thirds of the votes are against the Chief Executive, he is deposed. Should the Chief Executive be reluctant to arrange for such a referendum, upon a demand of two-thirds of the Branches, the assistant to the Chief Executive has the right to arrange for the referendum.",
                "N. B. After a conference of the lecturer with the Chief Executive, the former made a motion only to elect financial secretaries. Mr. Stephen Muryn of Chicago was elected the General Financial Secretary. The election of the local secretaries was left to the Districts and Branches respectively. Other officers must be left entirely for the approval of the Chief Executive, after such names are presented or submitted by the respective Districts or Branches. Until further notice by the Chief Executive, the present officers hold their respective positions.",

All others are merely ethnographical material, who are either Little Russians, or Little Poles, who through their inertness, in case of fight, cannot be depended upon; but on the contrary, through their indifference they help the occupiers to hold the Ukrainian country and nation in bondage.",
                "Therefore, the Convention calls upon all Ukrainians to join the Ukrainian National Organizations and thoroughly fulfill the duties of the organizations, and at the same time train their children to do so.",

Therefore, the Convention appeals to all Ukrainians, in whatever part of the world they may be, to form clubs, groups, within the Siege organization, in every locality wherever there are ten or more Ukrainians to be found, and to see to it that they get in direct contact with the Siege Headquarters in Chicago, if they are in America, or with other Headquarters, if they are in any other part of the world.",

Therefore, because the Ukrainian nation is lacking all this on its own soil, it is in a state of war with all its occupiers. Although at the present moment the Ukrainian Nation is conquered, no lawful representative of the Ukrainian land and country has signed a peace treaty with its occupiers.",
                "The Convention finds it necessary to create a Ukrainian State Center, outside its own country, where it can be free to establish the necessary Ukrainian institutions, organizations, and newspapers. Such a center should not have a committee, but one person; because wherever a committee rules, it usually leads only to deterioration of the national ideals. Committees should be created only as advisory bodies, which can take care of certain branches of general business.",

                "An event, unusual but solemnly beautiful to the Ukrainian Catholics, took place at the St. Nicholas Church (Oakley and Rice Sts.) on January 26, 1936. From his Eminence Cardinal Mundelein's Seminary came some fifty students preparing for the priesthood of the Latin Rite, a number of whom are to be ordained in a few months. In this group were accompanying priests and deacons. They all came to attend in our Greek Catholic Church the Holy Mass and to behold the Holy Eucharist according to the Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom. The sight of the tall young student priests garbed in black and white and placed around the altar and in the front pews inspired the admiration and respect of all behold us. The sermon was delivered in English by a priest representing the seminary. His sermon made the hearers feel that the Catholic Church is drawing all its followers still more closely together, even though different rites and different languages are used. He stressed the fact that languages and rites do not matter when the liturgy celebrated is the same as in Catholic Churches. He emphasized the unity found in the Catholic Church and asked that we pray for other peoples to be led to this unity--the Catholic Church, which brings light to all. The entire service seemed more beautiful that day than ever, with brilliantly lighted Christmas trees, with gleaming candles on marble altars, with the graceful altar boys aiding the Basilian Fathers at Mass, and with the choir uplifting each soul with praises of God."

                "The question, whom shall we follow for a leader, often arises and is rarely satisfactorily answered. Shall we follow older people? They have the advantage of years, but mere survival does not prove superior wisdom. They have observed failure and success, and have had more time to make mistakes but their experiences have been based upon bitterness. Why shouldn't we then follow Christ. Men require that their leader be wise, firm, brave, sympathetic and the possessor of ability to forget himself in his devotion to a noble and worthy cause. Does not Christ measure to these requirements? He is wise, for the experience of nearly two thousand years has revealed no folly in Him. No one was more firm, more courageous, more keenly aware of what human life can mean. There was no other who so freely gave self-oblivious devotion to a great and sufficient cause as He did. Man from all diversified influences needs solely some dominant integrating influence. He needs stimulus to unlock the store of energy within him. Christ can more than adequately supply a dominating and integrating influence. Let Him be the leader of followers.",
                "Let Him be the leader of young Ukrainians in the United States and Canada. Some people think that religion should interfere with nothing. Surely, it should not interfere, but it should guide us to do right for ourselves and for all. Christ was a leader for our forefathers, for even the earliest Cossacks at first fought in defense of Christ's words and not for political reasons. Now again, after the Great War the Ukrainian Youth in Europe are adopting Christ as their leader. Their motto: \"Ukrainian Youth for Christ\" is constantly shining ahead of all their activities and movements. Make Christ our leader too.",

                "There are many hundreds of thousands of people in the United States-- Ukrainians, Rumanians, Syrians, Albanians and others--who call themselves \"Greek Catholics.\" It is well that other Catholics should know that these people are our fellow Catholics. They are called \"Greek Catholics\" because they use the ancient Greek liturgy, although these rites are not usually performed in the Greek language. Some of them use Cyrillic (ancient liturgical Slavic), others Rumanian, but in every instance it is with the full approval of Rome. These Catholics are no different from any others; all of us adhere to the same religion, with the Holy Father as our head. There is no difference in belief between us. All Catholics believe alike, whatever may be their liturgy. Greek Catholics are such because they use the Greek liturgy, just as we are Roman Catholics because we use the Latin liturgy--but we are all Catholics. These are our fellow Catholics. Let us, therefore, extend them the hand of friendship.",
                "There is a still larger number of people living in the United States--Russians, Ukrainians, Rumanians, Greeks, Syrians and others--who belong to the Orthodox Eastern church, which is, next to the Catholic church, the largest Christian denomination in the world. Their church has valid orders and has preserved the deposit of faith in a much larger measure than has any other dissident denomination; however, they are not Catholics and do not call themselves such; they refer to themselves colloquially as \"Greek Orthodox\". Although both the Greek Catholics and the Greek Orthodox use the Greek liturgy and share many customs and characteristics, they are, in religion, poles apart. The former are our fellow Catholics, the latter are not.",
                "There exists in the United States, unfortunately, a widespread popular misconception as to the meaning of the designation \"Greek Catholics.\" Many people imagine erroneously that members of the Orthodox Eastern Church are called \"Greek Catholics\"--they are not and they make no claim to the name. In Eastern Europe and Western Asia, from whence these people come, the distinction is understood. Of those who use the Greek liturgy, the Catholics are called \"Greek Catholics\", and the others are universally called \"Greek Orthodox\" or simply \"Orthodox\"--never \"Greek Catholics.\" So widespread is this error in the United States, even among otherwise well-informed Catholics, that there is the danger of our forcing the name \"Greek Catholics\" upon the members of the Orthodox Eastern church, who heretofore have never made claim to it."

                "On November 26, 1931, twenty-five years will have passed since the organization of the St. Nicholas Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church of Chicago. The anniversary of this event is of great importance to the Ukrainian people of the United States from a nationalistic as well as a religious standpoint; for the history of the Ukrainian people has been preserved by their Church in the United States.",
                "About fifty years ago the Ukrainian people--a totally disorganized group--immigrated to the United States and to other countries of the New World. Very few of these immigrants intended to settle permanently in this strange land. They came for the purpose of making money--and after they had made enough money they intended to return to their native land. But they stayed on, and presently their desire to return home was forgotten in their joy at having found this land of plenty.",
                "To satisfy their religious needs they attended the Russian Orthodox and the Polish churches which had been established here for some time. These first Ukrainian immigrants became very attached to these churches. Through the agitation of the Russian Orthodox and Polish priests the Ukrainians began to call themselves Rusini (Russians)--and to assimilate the customs of this group. It was not until later, when the immigration of the Lithuanians from eastern Galicia had increased, that the Ukrainian Greek Catholic parishes began to organize and to build their own churches. Within these churches our people formed groups whose duty it was to preserve the particular customs and traditions of their native land. A historian who undertakes to write the history of our people in either the United States or in Canada should first consult the Ukrainian Churches, for only there will he find the necessary material for his work.",
                "The Organization of the Ukrainian Greek Churches in Chicago",
                "In 1905, the city of Chicago and the surrounding territory contained a few score of Ukrainian inhabitants--immigrants from eastern Galicia. Among them was the family of Jacob Olenec, to which a son, Michael Olenec, who now is operating a drugstore on Chicago Avenue, was born August 16, 1905. The baptism of their son presented a problem to the Olenec family. The father learned of a Greek Catholic Church on the South Side of Chicago at 4949 South Seeley Street, whose pastor, Father Victor Kowalitsky, and parishioners were natives of the Carpathian Ukraine. Mr. Jacob Olenec asked Father Kowalitsky to baptize his son and also invited the Father to attend the baptismal party. During the celebration at Mr. Olenec's home, Father Kowalitsky advised the guests to organize their own church. The assembled guests accepted Father Kowalitsky's advice and decided to call a meeting for this purpose in the near future.",
                "According to the parochial books the first meeting was held on December 31, 1905, at 939 North Robey Street (now Damen Avenue). This meeting was opened by Father Kowalitsky with the Lord's Prayer, and he spoke to the assemblage on the need for organizing their own church. He also told them that for eight thousand dollars they could buy a church on Bicker-dike Street from the Danish people. At this meeting it was resolved to purchase this church. Twelve church officers were elected at once.",
                "First Church Committee",
                "The first church committee was composed of the following persons: Father Victor Kowalitsky, president; John Tzihon, vice-president; Peter Winiarsky, treasurer; and Dr. Vladimir Sieminovich, secretary.",
                "The trustees were: Attorney Stephen Yanovich, Michael Zyma, John Shved, Carl Dziak, Nicholas Labant, Stephen Horansky, Jacob Olenec, Basil Biskup.",
                "The following men were elected as collectors: Anton Molochnyk, Andrew Kymak, Stephen Horansky, Andrew Cherepa, Nicholas Kozuba, Basil Biskup, John Kregel, and Jacob Olenec.",
                "At this meeting thirty-three persons volunteered contributions totaling five hundred dollars for the organizing fund. Six people offered to lend money for the purchase of the church; toward this fund Mr. Jacob Olenec gave five hundred dollars. The Union Bank lent them five thousand dollars which was secured by a first mortgage. The remaining two thousand, secured by a second mortgage, was borrowed from John Shved and Peter Winiarsky (each of whom lent a thousand dollars).",
                "There were fifty-one people present at the first mass, each of whom contributed one dollar.",
                "At the meeting mentioned above it was also resolved that the committee hold a meeting at 7 P.M., January 2, 1906, at the office of Fritz Frantzena, 292 Milwaukee Avenue. At this time they planned to sign the contract for the purchase of the church and to make a five-hundred-dollar down payment with the promise to pay the remaining sum after a period of twenty days.",
                "The minutes of the first meeting were signed by the following: Father Victor Kowalitsky, Michael Zyma, John Tzihon, and Dr. Vladimir Sieminovich.",
                "At the first meeting (December 31, 1905) it was decided to name the church St. Nicholas, and to sign it over to our bishop who was to come to America.",
                "On January 28, 1906, the newly organized Ukrainian Church on Bickerdike Street held its first mass, which was celebrated by Father Kowalitsky. The altar on which the first mass was celebrated was donated by the Magyar Roman Catholic Church of Burnside.",
                "After the first services, news of the newly organized Ukrainian Church of the Greek rite spread rapidly among our fellow Ukrainians and the parish began to increase.",
                "Pastors of the Church",
                "The first priest to serve as pastor of the St. Nicholas Church was Father Victor Kowalitsky, as we have mentioned. It was not an easy task for the first pastor to lead the newly organized parish; it was necessary to devote much work and energy to providing the church with the necessary equipment, for the income was very small. The parochial books of that time show that the income for the first six months of 1907 was $1,469.08.",
                "Father Kowalitsky was pastor of the St. Nicholas Church for approximately a year and a half. He left the parish on the Saturday before Palm Sunday in 1907. After him came Father L. Besaha who was pastor of the parish only a few months; the parochial books record the name of Father Besaha at the yearly meeting of July 7, 1907, and by the following meeting, which was held on October 13, 1907, he had gone. (This meeting was opened by Basil Kowalsky, who was appointed as a delegate to New York to greet Bishop Ortynsky.)",
                "After the departure of Father Besaha, Father Nicholas Strutynsky became pastor (he is now priest of a Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in Detroit, Michigan). Father Strutynsky presided over the parochial meeting held November 17, 1907. At this meeting it was resolved to pay the cathedraticum to the Ukranian Bishop Ortynsky, the bishop who had just arrived from Eastern Galicia. This order was issued by Pope Pius himself.",
                "Father Strutynsky was pastor of the St. Nicholas Church for nearly fourteen years, and during his pastorate the parish grew visibly. At this time many Ukrainian people began coming to the United States from the old country; the Ukrainian group in this country was steadily growing larger.",
                "Then Father Strutynsky suggested the plan of building a new church in a different locality, and this was carried out.",
                "In 1921 Father Strutynsky went to another parish; in his place came Father Constantine Kyrylo, who remained here one year. After him (in 1922) came Father Basil Stetsiuk who began working energetically to advance the work of his predecessors, but this did not last long for Father Stetsiuk's work was terminated by his tragic death.",
                "In 1923 Father Philemon Tarnawsky was appointed pastor of this church where he remains to this very day and where, with God's grace, he leads this parish.",
                "Since the organization of the St. Nicholas Church the following priests have served as assistant pastors: Father Michael Kuzmak (now pastor of the St. Mary's Ukrainian Church on the South Side of Chicago), Father Merenkiw, Father Leo Van, and Father Michael Kindey.",
                "After the death of Father Stetsiuk and until the coming of Father Tarnawsky, Father Denis Giretsky served as visiting pastor.",
                "The Building of A New Church",
                "In order that the plan to build a new church might be carried out, it was first necessary to purchase the land. In 1912 Mr. Basil Kowalsky found the lots--a large tract of land at Oakley Boulevard and Rice Streets--which the parish bought, and where they began building the new church.",
                "The building plans were drawn up by I. G. Stienbach, and the construction work was carried out by M. Ryan (both residents of this city).",
                "On November 27, 1913, the cornerstone was blessed by Bishop Ortynsky. At this ceremony the church made a clear profit of $507.86. The church was erected in 1914.",
                "The first mass in the newly built church was held Christmas Day, January 7, 1915.",
                "The newly built St. Nicholas Church is an enormous temple; no Ukrainian church in the United States or Canada can compare with it.",
                "The church, a wooden structure, is designed in the Galician-Ukrainian style. It is painted in the Byzantine style with the Slavic stylistic motives of Kiev and Novogorod.",
                "The edifice contains nine pictures. There is a painting in the upper apse (the presbytery), and in the apsidal recess there is a reproduction of the celebrated \"Immovable Wall\" of the St. Sophia of Kiev and the monumental Holy Virgin, \"Oranta\" (the Praying Virgin). In the lower compartment there is the magnificent representation of the \"Eucharist,\" an ancient motif borrowed from the same St. Sophia of Kiev. The painting represents our Lord administering Holy Communion to the Apostles.",
                "Above the apse, in the \"triumphal arc,\" there is a large painting depicting \"Deisus\" (the Supplicant). In the middle is the figure of our Lord with the open Gospel in his left hand. To the right of His image rests the Holy Virgin, and to the left is St. John the Baptist, both with heads lowered in prayer. Behind the Holy Virgin stands St. Nicholas, the Patron of the Church; and behind the figure of John is the Martyred St. Josephat. Both Saints maintain an attitude of prayer for their faithful people.",
                "Within the northern arc is a large painting of the Pentecost, a reproduction of the descent of the Holy Spirit on the Apostles.",
                "On the southern arc is a large painting representing the Assumption of the Holy Virgin in the Novogorod style of the fourteenth century. In the four corners under the apsidal are four Evangelists and their symbols resting on thrones.",
                "The stained-glass windows are decorated with beautiful mosaics. In the large window over the choir loft is the traditional picture of Judgment Day. The window in the north wall contains a picture of the Birth of Christ. In the south window is a large picture of the Transfiguration of our Lord. In the eight small double windows are beautiful pictures of saints facing the altar.",
                "This is the first time stained glass has been used as a medium for Byzantine art.",
                "The main altar, the tabernacle altar, and the two side altars, are made of white Italian marble with Byzantine mosaics.",
                "All of the sketches for the ornamentation of the windows and altars were planned and drawn by Father Gleb Werchowsky. The painting and most of the decorating was executed by our Chicago Ukranian artist, Mr. Theodore Katamay.",
                "The stained-glass windows were constructed by a Chicago firm, the \"Munich Studios\".",
                "The St. Nicholas Ukrainian Church embraces nearly eight hundred Ukrainian families who support it materially and physically. There are approximately five hundred families who are faithful parishioners and about three hundred of these are grouped near the church, thereby confining their spiritual and national needs.",
                "The church also provides an evening school where several hundred Ukrainian children who attend a public school during the day are being taught to read and write the Ukrainian Language. The school is conducted by the Sisters of the Basilian Order and Mr. Dmytro Atamanets.",
                "There are many societies within the church. One of the most zealous church societies is the adult Apostolic Prayer Society (which was confirmed by the diocese director, the late Father Zahar Orun, on May 3, 1916); there are four juvenile branches of the Apostolic Prayer Society (two of girls, and two of boys, all of which were organized in 1924). There are also: Mary's Company (organized in 1927), the Sisterhood of the Immaculate Conception (the latest to be organized), St. Stephen Society (organized in 1908), and the St. Nicholas Society (organized in 1906), branches of the Ukrainian National Association; the St. George Society, the Markiyan Shashkevich Society, a branch of the Providence Association (a benevolent organization); and the St. Vladimir Society, a branch of the Ukrainian Workingmen's Association.",
                "Many of the parishioners belong to the United Hetman Organization and the Sitch Red Cross. The church has its own singing society, the Lysenko Chorus, which is directed by Dmytro Atamanets.",
                "Ever since the establishment of the St. Nicholas Church the parishioners have taken an active part in Ukrainian National affairs, and have contributed considerably to the relief of their native country.",
                "The Ukrainian committee collected eight thousand dollars during the time of the Ukrainian liberation conflict to be donated as a \"National Loan\". Not long ago there was a collection of one thousand dollars for the so-called \"Needy Fund,\" which provides aid for our native country. There have been many contributions to the \"native school\" of the old country; not long ago, at the time of the visit of the \"native school\" delegate, Mr. Yasinchuk, a donation of thirteen hundred dollars was collected. There have also been many collections for Ukrainian invalids in Europe.",
                "Every year the parish, either separately or in conjunction with other societies, observes traditional national Ukrainian holidays, and holds exhibitions and important religious and patriotic festivities which reveal the national spirit.",
                "The organization of church societies at the St. Nicholas Church added much to the strengthening and uplifting of the religious spirit among our parishioners, and at the same time created moral discipline among them. They also made the group more conscious of their national obligation, always to aid the native cause.",
                "Our societies have exercised a definite influence on the young Lithuanians who are natives of this country: youth that attends its own church, hears its own mass, speaks its own language, and sings in its own choir.",
                "Ukrainian Night School",
                "The night school at the St. Nicholas Parish is very important to the children who attend public day schools where they do not acquire any religious training. They are given this training in the parochial night school. Besides this they learn to speak and to write their own language, and to understand the history and geography of their native land. In this way we are filling the hearts and souls of our young with the desire to love their own. During the last nine years approximately three hundred students have received diplomas from the Ukrainian Parochial School. In 1925 the order of Basilian Sisters came to teach the students. The parish also maintains two separate schools where about eighty children attend classes.",
                "The Lysenko Chorus of St. Nicholas Church",
                "The Lysenko chorus is a singing and dramatic society, which, in addition to performing the functions of the church, gives plays, concerts, and other cultural entertainments. All this takes place in the hall of the St. Nicholas Church. The Lysenko was organized in 1907. Its founders were Father Nicholas Strutynsky and Michael Kostiuk, who became the first leader of the chorus. At that time many Ukrainian people, especially the young Ukrainian businessmen, assisted in the organization and development of this society.",
                "During the leadership of Michael Kostiuk the chorus took part in a contest of choruses at Riverview Park; the chorus sang two songs: \"Vulitzia\" (Street) and \"Hulyali\" (Danced).",
                "In 1917 Basil Kotziubinsky was engaged as leader of the chorus. He led the group for three years and presented many plays and concerts for the Ukrainian colony in Chicago.",
                "In 1920--1922, Theodore Hoptiak and the late Natalia Hruniewetska led the chorus.",
                "Father Basil Stetsiuk, who personally was a great lover of music and who sang very well himself, was appointed pastor of the church in 1922. From the very beginning of his pastorate he attempted to broaden the scope of the chorus and to direct its singing activities into the field of higher art. Through him the chorus was divided into two parts--male and mixed. The male chorus was led by Father Stetsiuk himself, and the mixed by Mr. Hoptiak. In this year both choruses appeared at the World's Exhibition at the Municipal Pier in Chicago. This concert was heard by about ten thousand people and was written up in all the American newspapers of Chicago.",
                "In 1922 the church officers asked Mr. Dmytro Atamanets to lead their chorus. He accepted and is still successfully leading this chorus.",
                "In Europe Mr. Dmytro Atamanets took an active part as an actor-singer in Stadnyks-Lviw Ukrainian Theatre; later, after his arrival in this country he worked as director of a chorus in Detroit, Michigan. After accepting the leadership of the Lysenko chorus Mr. Atamanets displayed his organizing ability in his endeavor to raise the status of the chorus. The progress of the Lysenko chorus received great commendation in the city of Chicago as well as in other cities.",
                "The Lysenko Singing Society gives annual concerts to celebrate Schevchenko, November holiday, and other national holidays. They have presented a series of concerts on the radio. The chorus appears to be the cultural fire of the Ukrainian parish, where the Ukrainian group can always find cultural activity to warm its aesthetic sensibilities--for they love their own native art. The patriotic work of the Lysenko Singing Society and its leader, Mr. Dmytro Atamanets, is highly appreciated by the parish. We are glad to have among us such an active nationalistic organization."

                "In September 1930 a hundred years have passed since on the site of today's Chicago, the first white people settled down. At this time I wish to say a few words on the history of Chicago, and especially on the beginning of our Ukrainian immigration into this city.",
                "Chicago is situated on the river known by the same name, which today divides the city into three parts. Once this vicinity was a muddy space, the main part being a thick forest, which only the Indians had lived on. Just a hundred years ago the white people began to settle here. They had to carry on a persistent war with the Indians, who would not let the white people into their habitat.",
                "The first white person who saw this territory, about ten or more years before the white people had settled here permanently, was a French Jesuit priest, Father Marquette, who tried to convert the Indians to the Christian faith. He died in this region. When more white people appeared on the site of this town, the federal government constructed a defensive fort on the island between the two branches of the Chicago River, and named it after its first commander, Fort Dearborn.",
                "In a short time the Indians attacked Fort Dearborn, and mowed down not only the small number of soldiers, but all the rest of the white inhabitants who sheltered themselves here from the Indians.",
                "From this time on there were more whites settled, and in 1833 the colony of Chicago received its city charter.",
                "And we Ukrainians too form a part of the colonization in this world renowned city.",
                "How many Ukrainians there are living in Chicago no one knows exactly, for there is no complete census available. The number is estimated from fifteen to thirty thousand; if we take the median we may surely number them to the amount of twenty thousand.",
                "I came to Chicago from Shamokin, Pa., where I practiced medicine in the year 1893. I came hither only because at that time the Chicago World's Fair was in progress and also to visit my friend, the late Stephen Yanovich, who conducted a law office in this metropolis.",
                "At that time there were so few Ukrainians in Chicago that one could count them on his fingers. They were mostly the Lemko-Ukrainians, who then called themselves \"Slovaks\" instead of Ukrainians or Carpathian-Ukrainians.",
                "Here was a Russian church located at Center Avenue, far back of the railroad tracks, beyond the 16th street. Thither I went to church, trying to find my own natives. It was useless, for there was only a few Hungarian-Ukrainians, calling themselves \"Hungarian-Russians.\"",
                "This went on for about three years. In the end the Lemko-Ukrainians began to flock in. With them I tried to organize at least a small church, for this was the only way to organize our people into a group. At first we called priests from distant places, even if it were for only one Sunday service. The first priest who came to us was a Hungarian-Ukrainian, whose name I have forgotten. At that time there was not a large enough number of our people, even among the Carpathian-Ukrainians, so that we could organize a separate permanent parish. That is why we were quite satisfied with the services, the priest performed in the basement of St. Stanislaw Kostka's Church, Noble and Bradley streets. After some time we called the late Father Konstankewicz from Shamokin, Pa., and started to organize the parish all over again, at this time were likewise unsuccessful. Later on we called Father Izmaylo Kulchytsky. Now there were a few scores of our people already. Father Kulchytsky celebrated his first holy mass in a settlement house on Noble and Augusta Streets. Now it appeared to us that people did not want to rent out places for services from the Poles any more. That is why we obtained the permission to use the American settlement house for our services.",
                "This time we really started to organize a parish in Chicago. We held a few meetings at my home, because Father Kulchytsky lived with me. This was about ten years after my coming to Chicago. But it was found out that there was not enough of us to support a priest, not to speak about building or buying a church. So again we postponed organizing the church for some time. In the end Father Kowalitsky came on his own accord; he was a Carpathian Ukrainian priest. We called a few of the leading people together: the late Mr. Fetzura, Mr. Vitzarsky, and others, and decided to call a general meeting of our Ukrainian Greek-Catholics. The meeting was held above a saloon on Robey (now Damen Avenue) and Homer Street. Here we put together a few hundred dollars to buy a church. At that time a Swedish church together with a small home for a priest was for sale on Superior and Bickerdyke Streets.",
                "Mr. Yanovich and myself gave a few hundred dollars as a down payment, and for the rest we signed a note, which bought this church and home. Our first Ukrainian services were held here. But before this, there was a great deal of trouble, for some of our Lemko-Ukrainians (Mountaineers), especially the late Mr. Fetzura, and a few Ukrainians from lower Hungary, did not want Ukrainian Greek-Catholic church, but the Orthodox one. The majority however wanted the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church, which remained so.",
                "Afterwards trouble started again, for the Carpathian Ukrainians wanted to have their own way about the services and the Lemkos wished their own. This was very unharmonious at times; for the Galician Ukrainians sang in their manner, and the Carpathian Ukrainians in their own fashion.",
                "In order to overcome this distress, I organized a church chorus, which checked the misunderstandings for a while. Afterwards, during the second year of Father Kowalitsky's pastorate again a disagreement arose, because our Galician element was growing stronger and started to demand the resignation of the Carpathian Ukrainian priest, asking for their own. Yet Father Kowalitsky would not resign.",
                "This disorder led to the expulsion of the priest with the aid of the police. This conflict was inspired by a Galician Ukrainian, Mr. Kowalsky.",
                "Thus our church was left without a priest. Easter was near and we could not get any priest. The people began to be confused.",
                "Then we, together with Mr. Kowalsky, turned to Pennsylvania for a priest. At that time we had not our own bishop, so we had to seek a priest ourselves. But no priest was too eager to starve in Chicago. In desperation, Mr. Kowalsky, who is now a fireman, found a Polish Orthodox priest, Father Pociecha, who knew a little of our liturgy. This orthodox priest celebrated the Ukrainian Easter services as best he knew. Anyway, the people were satisfied with such a priest.",
                "Shortly afterwards there came to Chicago from Canada, Father Nicholas Strutynsky, who took over the Chicago parish. In a short time, our group grew so large that the church on Superior and Bickerdyke Streets became too small. Father Strutynsky then bought sixteen lots, where the church of St. Nicholas is now located, i. e., on Oakley and Rice Streets.",
                "At that time this vicinity had very few buildings. Together with Father Strutynsky we went to a Polish priest who was then building a church opposite our old one, to find out the name of the architect. Father Strutynsky consequently made plans for the new Ukrainian church which exists now. At first we were going to make the interior with the Hutzul-Ukrainian embroidery designs, but it was found to be too expensive for our colony; so we put the Hutzulian embroidery design, only in the front of the church.",
                "The first civic society in Chicago was the one under the name of \"Yurey Solomeychuk,\" whereof the members called it \"Hutzul Solomeychuk,\" to honor the man who just then was arrested in Kolomeya by the Austrian- Polish officials for his patriotic revolutionary speeches. Upon completion of the church, the society moved with its library into the basement of the church, changing its name to \"Brotherhood of St. Nicholas, Branch 106, of the Ukrainian National Association,\" and thus it was incorporated.",
                "The library, which cost nearly $250, was likewise located in the hall of St. Nicholas Church. People borrowed books, but left no trace of them, for once taken they were not returned.",
                "In the year of 1907 Dr. Stephen Hrynieviecky and his wife, Natalia, came to Chicago. The doctor and Madam Hrynieviecky began to take an active part in our community affairs; especially the late Madam Hrynieviecky, who undertook training a Ukrainian chorus.",
                "Through her expert instruction she gained fame among the Chicagoans. During one celebration at Grant Park, in the heart of the city, she led all the assembled choruses of Chicago that numbered more than a thousand singers. In this ensemble the chorus of Madam Hrynieviecky also took part, of course.",
                "Today Chicago has four Ukrainian Greek-Catholic churches and parishes, and a church for the Carpathian Ukrainians; one orthodox and one national independent church, besides. For the present these few reminiscences on the Ukrainians in Chicago will be sufficient. In the future I will write something on a larger scale."

Our grandfathers, just on the verge of that terrible evening, when the worst war in history commenced with thundering cannonading, whispered stories to their grandchildren about you, our great Prince of the Church, undaunted hero. Your glorious deeds will pass on and be written in golden letters on the pages of our history as a perpetual legacy for all the generations to come.

You were the only one then (during the capture of the remnants of the Ukrainian land by the Russians) who dared to preach the word of God on Faith, Hope and Charity, during those days of horror and doubt; during the hour of national bitter suffering and disorder.

Even before this many of our members had joined the 132nd Infantry so as to become American soldiers and thereby acquire more military training. Today our aim is to explain to our readers why we should join the United States National Guard.",
                "It is not beyond possibility that some will think that this is unreasonable, saying: How can one remain a Ukrainian patriot and still join the ranks of another country's army, thereby so seriously obligating himself to serve the interests of another commonwealth, when military service with all its burden and eventualities is only for war?",
                "Such a question might justly be raised among all honest people who have become accustomed to the serious outlook on life. Therefore we must answer in this manner: By joining the United States National Guard nobody impairs his patriotism, even as nobody harms it by becoming an American citizen. But by becoming a citizen of this country one is obligated to protect its interests against the enemy. If one were to become a citizen of the United States only because of the material and political advantages which this citizenship offers and was not willing to carry any of its burdens and obligations, it would be a contemptible procedure, and such a man never could be considered a good citizen.",
                "A Ukrainian has no country of his own as yet, and when he takes the oath on becoming an American citizen, he does not betray any one except the Austrian, Polish, Russian, or Roumanian government.

                "First of all we must consider this special aspect of our subject. The United States is the only country in the world in which a person can become a citizen and still not betray the nation of his birth or lose its spirit, for the simple reason that the American nation is composed of people of many nationalities who compose this mutually governing and working commonwealth. There is no other country in the world of which you may become a citizen and still remain a son of your European Fatherland, so that you can actually help it and fight for it. As an example we have here the Irish, who through a few hundred years of Americanization,have acquired all the necessary material resources and have carried on a fight against England for their independence and gained it.",
                "As another instance take the Poles, who with their American comrades gained the freedom of Poland. The Czechs achieved the same end through American soldiers who at the same time were Czechs and patriots, and the same thing happened to the Slovaks and the Lithuanians.",
                "The nature of the American state usually favors the endeavors to attain freedom of those countries which are oppressed or abused and which have nationals among the citizens of the United States. We can maintain with absolute certainty that no other country in the world has this spirit, for not one of them would permit immigrants to found national societies or create military units to serve their oppressed native lands.",
                "America cannot have any colonizing intentions regarding the European countries; therefore it does not have them in regard to the Ukraine. Its intentions are clear and honorable. The American love of freedom is universally known. This love inspired America to help in forming national legions for the oppressed nations, and many who joined these legions were found to be good American citizens.",
                "It is true that we often hear Americans say that only that immigrant can make a good and patriotic citizen of the United States who was and is a good patriot with respect to his native land. This is true, for how can you love the country in which you were not born and be true to it if you do not love and honor the country in which you were born? But it is not difficult for our Ukrainian patriots to join the United States military service. There is no difference between Ukrainian and American patriotism.",
                "There is one important fact which influences the majority of our people, and that is that the United States does not have compulsory military service. The American Government does not force you to render military service as other countries do, and that is why it appears to Ukrainians that the United States does not regard such service as obligatory. Therefore, any one may say, \"My home is on the border,\" and he may carry on his business in the hope that the army which he was not forced to join will defend him from the country's enemies. But he who truly accepts American citizenship and knows what it means to be a member of a commonwealth should understand that in return for all the benefits which he enjoys as a citizen of this vast American country he should help to carry certain burdens. Of these obligations the most important is that every normal and healthy man should help to defend the country in which he enjoys privileges and of which he receives benefits. He who does not care to defend this country came here only seeking something for nothing. The mere fact that we are American citizens should impel us to enter the United States military service so as not to hide behind the backs of other citizens, dwelling as peaceful inhabitants who seek only our own comfort, when instead we should be ready to give our lives for the country of which we have vowed to be loyal citizens.",
                "The United States maintains the so-called National Guard, the military organization which accepts all men who care to enlist voluntarily. This same service sent some millions of soldiers to the French front, thereby determining the outcome of the great war. Soldiers of all the [subjected] nations were enlisted in this military service, and as a result they now may boast of having their own countries.",
                "Where were the Ukrainians then? Some of us called ourselves Austrians, others Magyars; and those who considered themselves Russians rejoiced because the Russian mobilization could not reach them here in the United States. Those Ukrainians, almost thirty thousand of them, even in the time of the war might have made their way into the United States Army, thereby getting to the front, but they did not form any fighting unit and did not have any political influence. They therefore had no effect on the destiny of our native land, for they were unorganized, and they had no prestige; hardly any one knew about them.",
                "Is it not time that we corrected this infirmity? We do not know whether there may not shortly be a new World War, which again will change the map of Europe, and in which again the fate of the Ukraine will be involved. No one can guarantee that it will not come to this. Let us suppose that this will not take place in our generation; is it not nevertheless worth while to have our own American-Ukrainian military unit here in the country where we are allowed to have such things?",
                "As we mentioned above, the reason why the United States did not speak up for us Ukrainians is that we lacked Ukrainian-American soldiers in the World War. Now we may say, to console ourselves, that the will to found our own country was too weak at that time; the idea of a free Ukraine was limited to Ukrainians in Germany or Austria because the rest of our fighting men were in the same encampment with Russia, and therefore even America would have [been against any attempt of theirs to attain independence]. The result is that our politicians did not adjust themselves in time and came to their senses too late as usual, though the fact that it was too late was hardly our fault.",
                "We now see that America will be the one to decide the future conflicts of the world. Therefore whom should we conciliate for our cause if not America?",
                "There are two different advantages in creating a Ukrainian military unit in America: first, the national and political advantages for the Ukraine; second, the advantage for the individual Ukrainian-American, who will be benefited by it later on.",
                "The first advantage is political. If we have military unites in the American Army, Washington will officially recognize us as a nation. The American Government and its laws do not recognize those peoples who have countries of their own unless they declare themselves as nations striving to gain their independence, [demonstrating their purpose by] forming separate units in the American Army. The historic examples of this are the above-mentioned Polish, Czech, and Lithuanian legions; through them America recognized their peoples as nations--nations deprived of their countries. To put it briefly, in order that America may recognize us as a nation even before we have our own country, we must form at least one unit of the American National Guard. Therefore the first goal is that the Government of the United States shall acknowledge our national existence and the legitimacy of our efforts to attain independence.",
                "If the best and the largest unit of our potential Ukrainian Army shall be created and formed in America, then when it comes to founding our country, America and her Ukrainian citizens as soldiers of this army will have the right to say the deciding words, and no other Ukrainian formation will have that right.",
                "We, members of the Sitch organization, can and must achieve our aim because we are Americans! We must prove to America and to the whole world that we are a race fit to rule by our nature and by our cast of thought, even if only because we want to receive the confidence of American governing circles; and by enlisting in the National Guard we shall achieve the most important aim of our organization. If we do not achieve our aim, our Sitch organization will be merely a set of toy soldiers. Therefore, to put it briefly, the members of the Sitch organization have the opportunity to become real soldiers and to acquire all the military training requisite for modern warfare.",
                "Let us now view the individual and private advantages which the American Army offers. A member of the Sitch organization who enlists in the military service of the United States will be grateful to the United States for all the benefits which he has received and which he is to receive by living in this country. Every one knows what these benefits are, especially if he compares the misery and the political oppression from which he came with the life in America. A member of the Sitch society by enlisting in the Army has the opportunity to become a true patriot among honorable Americans and a full-fledged citizen. He ceases to be a foreigner and becomes a real American. Every one can understand how this may prove advantageous in future years. A Ukrainian who enlists in the National Guard has the opportunity to learn something, to broaden his education by pursuing many technical studies, very profitable for him and for the group which he frequents outside the service. The member of the Sitch organization who enlists in the National Guard finds himself in the company of good people who are conscious of their governmental and social obligations; therefore such a member has the opportunity to utilize his free moments culturally at the proper educational gatherings. Ukrainians enlisting in the National Guard also have a chance to learn dicipline and order, which our people sadly lack.",
                "Besides all the above-mentioned opportunities the founding of a Ukrainian military unit has one more advantage, perhaps the most important of all, namely, that these Sitch soldiers will play the principal part in the liberation of the Ukraine; therefore they will be the founders of a large and important Ukrainian army which under the leadership of Hetman Skoropadsky will create a new, invincible commonwealth of Cossacks and forever defend the freedom and the liberty of our native land."

In addition the League has communicated with the societies of the Ukrainian Youth League in our native country and with Catholic organizations of other nations, The Ukrainian youth could very soom create a united front by becoming members of their local societies, and by these local societies becoming members of the Ukrainian Youth League. The Ukrainian youth of the United States and Canada would then profit from the movement on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the League would become an effective force among its own people and the people of other nations. Therefore, those societies and clubs that do not as yet belong to the Ukrainian Catholic Youth League are urged to announce their Ukrainian character by joining. We urge those young, energetic men and women who live in localities having no youth club to establish one of their own and to announce its affiliation with the League.

                "Some time last year, in October, to be more exact, a movement was started throughout the United States to educate at least part of the Ukrainian Youth in the science of aeronautics. Racial pride, perhaps, was the cause of this movement, precipitated no doubt, by the epic flight of the Italian air force; and then again, a trained body of fliers would be an untold military advantage should the occasion ever arise for their need.",
                "Throughout the different cities, notably Chicago and Detroit, students gathered under competent instructors. With eager enthusiasm they met, desiring to be among the first to have their name inscribed as the pioneers in Ukrainian aviation. The Detroit branch or Corps II, we hear, is progressing satisfactorily and Chicago is very nearly finished with the first part of the movement.",
                "The actual formation in Chicago of Corps I was made under the head of Captain Charkow who holds a limited commercial pilot's license, thus qualifying him for this position. With Colonel Shapoval who was then head of the Siege Organization, they gathered twenty-five students to form the nuclei of this school.",
                "The place chosen for the instruction of the students was the printing shop of the Siege newspaper. Here, every Monday and Thursday evening between the hours of eight and ten, week in and week out, these pupils met to be initiated into the art of flying. No practical shopwork was given. The idea was to leave the student learn the theoretical side of the science and then, later, to send them to a school where actual training was to be given. Approximately 170 hours of study we necessary to cover such subjects as Aerodynamics, Engine Theory and Aerial Navigation. Tests were given at various intervals and a subject was concluded with a final examination. It has taken longer to finish this part of the course than was expected but that has been compensated for by the fact that each subject was thoroughly explained and more of it presented than is necessary for an ordinary pilot to know. During this time enrollment dropped considerably and the ones left can well be called the \"cream of the crop\". Further training in the military line will be given these boys and girls. Each student is to become an officer upon the final completion of the course and he will be trained to command. (A course in etiquette is also in the offing, a very wise idea, and instruction in the art of conversation and entertainment is seriously being considered). In order to bring the whole matter to a final conclusion it is only necessary for the older members of the organization to get together, to cease their bickering, and to send these youths to a practical school where actual flying can be taught. The strife in their ranks, or is it inertia, has resulted in very little being done, if anything at all. Rumor has it that some time back the Siege did make an agreement with the Curtiss Wright Corporation to send a number of students to their school at reduced rates. But nothing has come of it. The lack of money is a serious matter. It seems that no effort is being made to obtain any so far.",
                "In Detroit, however, there is more initiative. They have built a training plane, the Ukraine, which is to be christened on the nineteenth of August. This event will make history, for it is the first of its kind, and in the future Ukrainian avaiation will be more than a myth. That a vast city like Chicago should permit a smaller one to forge ahead of it in such a task is humiliating, but if by any chance Detroit should also have the honor of a student obtaining the first flying license in the organization then will our chagrin be complete, and low should hang our heads. Still, the cheering thought remains that at least our efforts have been successful as a whole and soon many more will tread in the footsteps of the leader, just as the Ukraine is forerunner of many to come. Incidentally, weather conditions permitting, Captain Charkow will make an exhibition parachute jump probably on the maiden flight of the Ukraine.",
                "The purpose, I repeat, of this movement has been two-fold. The first was to show the world that Ukrainians are not backward in one of the world's greatest undertaking. The second, the practical one, is not so honorable. If by any chance the much heralded conflict should come into being then will the value of this movement be seen. I, for one, hope that nothing of the sort will occur, but if the world should go mad and another holocaust be loosed, then we must take advantage and strike while the iron is hot. There are principles that must be defended and the principle of liberty is the greatest, yes, sufficiently great that millions of lives should be sacrificed for its existence. To release Ukraine from its despoilers and to give back its age old heritage of freedom, must be the final goal of every true Ukrainian."

Most appropriately they sang High Mass, and though this was the first performance of the kind, it served to effect the listeners most pleasantly. It showed that with cooperated energy little things develop to great indispensable realizations. It proved that work and patience can promote everlasting beauty. In the afternoon a picnic was arranged by the chorus members to which all were invited and at which all enjoyed themselves. The profit from the picnic was donated to the fund for the school soon to be built at the St. Nicholas Parish.",

A new attraction to keep the membership steady is a library which was officially opened July 20th. Though the library is simple and the collection not immense it is already beginning to expand. Members of the organization are privileged to draw books. Baseball is keeping both the boys and girls physically active. A group of boys are now publishing a new weekly in Chicago, called U. Y. O. A. Weekly (Ukrainian Youth's of America Weekly). The editor of this organ is N. Matviuw, and the business manager is J. Prietula."

In March a Ukrainian drama of five acts was enacted and sponsored solely by this organization and it was successfully done. On April 1st a concert in honor of the celebrated poet, Taras Shevchenko, was conducted by it. The organization meets every Friday for general meeting where business is performed, discussions heard and talks given by members, guests and the reverend missionaries. The group always gains unusual information and rare amusement from the lectures of Reverend missionary Markiw. The Culture Club, a division of this organization, meets after the general meeting to discuss topics of immediate interest, as poetry, education, music, heredity and behavior, or to have a debate. There are also music groups; a separate boys' chorus and girls' chorus. Both are under the direction of two organization members. The boys have been and are active in the sports division, and especially in baseball games. Socialsare held once a month in the form of short plays, concert numbers or movies. Also a sewing club for girls; another division meets weekly in order to learn the art of Ukrainian embroidery.

This year they also honored our greatest poet, Taras Shevchenko, on the one hundred and twentieth anniversary of his birth. Now they are preparing to pay tribute to the Ukrainian mother.

                "(Ukrainsky Profesionalisty v Ameritzi e v Kanadyi), (Winnepeg, Manitoba, Canada), PP. 49-52. By Stephen Sumeyko. (Address delivered at the First Congress of the Ukrainian Professionists--held in Chicago, August, 1933.",
                "JOURNALISM AS A PROFESSION FOR OUR YOUTH.",
                "Some day when a historian writes a history of American-Ukrainian life, he will undoubtedly designate the contemporary period as a period of transition. Today we are witnessing the gradual retirement and decline of the older generation of American--Ukrainians and the continually increasing influx in its stead of a new and fresh element--American--Ukrainian youth. Yet this displacement of one generation by another is not the most important manifestation of this transitory period. What is important is the beginning of a readjustment in the class status and class consciousness of the Ukrainians in America. From being a practically pure laboring class, the Ukrainian immigration in America, under the influence of favorable local conditions, is beginning to readjust itself to a more natural and balanced social order, based upon the proportionate presence of all classes which go into the make-up of a well balanced ethnic group: The laboring, the artisan, the business and, lastly, the cultural and professional classes.",
                "We have witnessed the coming of the Ukrainian artisan, the Ukrainian business man, and now we are witnessing the arrival of the Ukrainian professional man and woman. Every year brings and ever-increasing arrivals to this class. Every year we see more lawyers, doctors, engineers, dentists, teachers, accountants, musicians, and even a literary light or two appearing in our midst. Slowly but steadily we are assuming those positions which befit an inherently cultured and talented people such as ours.",
                "It is this gradually increasing entrance of our young men and women into the various professions that has led me to notice that there is one very important field which offers fine opportunities for our youth, and yet which for some reason or other seems to have been overlooked by them. The field or profession to which I refer is--journalism.",
                "What do I mean by journalism?",
                "Omitting a highly technical and exact definition, journalism is generally regarded as the profession or occupation of publishing, writing, or conducting a journal. \"Whether journalism is a profession, or an art, a science, a trade, a craft, or even a game depends,\" to quote one authority, upon the equipment, the point of view, the outlook and the motive of the individual engaged in it. To an editor or writer it is usually a profession, to a man in the advertising department it is a business, to a printer it is a trade. \"What I have in mind is that which begins with reporting and end with editing, and which, in view of present-day stringent requirements of preparation and training, may be properly called a profession.",
                "Although this profession offers fire opportunities for the individual engaged in it, as well as to the cause to which that individual may subscribe, yet as a life calling it does not seem to attract our young people, even though some of them have considerable talent for it.",
                "Here in America, journalism has reached its highest peak of development. The printed word is now more powerful than ever before. The American newspaper besides being a mirror of world-wide life is also a powerful instrument in the shaping of public opinion. It offers to the young man who seriously enters it an education in many respects greater than any college can afford; it puts him in close contact with life; it makes him broadminded and arouses a high degree of intellectual activity.",
                "Aside from these general advantages, however, there are additional benefits which will insure to those young American-Ukrainians who take up this profession as their life calling.",
                "Even the more pessimistic observers among us are beginning to see that the Ukrainian cause is assuming greater importance than ever before, despite all efforts of its enemies to the contrary. This growing importance of the Ukrainian cause has its repercussions here in America too, in the form of growing stability of American-Ukrainian life. Contributing to this stability is the realization by our people that their future welfare depends mostly upon these uniting their strength. Everywhere, therefore, efforts are being made to attain this unity. And with the elimination of certain evils from our life, these is very strong likelihood that Americans of Ukrainian descent will play a definite and important role in American life and at the same time be of considerable aid to their kinsmen in their native land Ukraine.",
                "Yet the entire matter depends upon the younger generation of American-Ukrainians. The older generation has built a foundation, and it is up to the younger generation to erect the rest of the structure. That is why the really decisively critical period in American-Ukrainian life, one that will determine its future existence, is yet to arrive during the span of American-Ukrainian Youth's existence.",
                "Happily for all of us, as well as for the Ukrainian cause, the American-Ukrainian youth is showing greater interest in the Ukrainian cause as well as in its own common fate than was even expected. Being gradually welded together by common descent and interests, it is beginning to show signs of living up to the hopes of the older generation and performing greater deeds than the older generation in the field of good American citizenship and in the sphere of Ukrainian National aspirations.",
                "Yet in order that these hopes be realized here in America as well as in the old country, in order that the youth may play its part in the building of American-Ukrainian life, it is absolutely necessary that the growing interest of our youth in Ukrainian affairs be never permitted to die out. It must be fanned to white heat and everlastingly kept there.",
                "And what medium other than the press, in all its manifold forms, will best succeed in keeping this interest burning brightly, in keeping alive in the future generations of American-Ukrainians the realization that they are descendents of a great race, that it is their duty besides being good American citizens to strive for the complete independence of Ukraine, and that also it is their solemn obligation to continue the works, and tasks of their parents and build them to even greater heights. There is hardly a doubt, I am sure, that in a country as large as America, where our people are scattered far and wide, the press is the best fitted to cope with such a tremendous task.",
                "It is my conviction that the Ukrainian newspaper in America has a fine future. The American-Ukrainian youth is far more accustomed to newspapers and more greatly dependent upon them than were our parents. In time, when this youth comes into its own, it will demand a press of its own, one that will reflect its life and help chart its course. Whether these newspapers will appear in the Ukrainian and English language is another matter and besides the point, for the same ideals can be expressed and disseminated in either language. It's the spirit that counts! The question arises, though, will there be sufficiently talented and trained American-Ukrainian journalists to rise to this demand, young men and women who have been born and raised here in America and yet who through diligent study are well acquainted with their Ukrainian background, with Ukrainian life, history, and culture?",
                "The answer to this most vital question can be determined now. Now is the time and opportunity for a number of talented young American-Ukrainians to prepare themselves for this calling--journalism in the field of American--Ukrainian life. Start now!"

                "To study the possible approaches to this problem of the Ukrainian Youth we ought to have a fair picture of the Ukrainian immigration.",
                "First of all, we generally like to compare our immigration with that of other nationalities and criticize accordingly. This is especially true with the American-born generation. The comparison is erroneous in that we are not comparing similarities. The fact that our immigration is practically the youngest that came to this continent does not allow comparison with such immigrations as the Irish and German which occured much earlier. Whereas the others through various generations have been ingraining themselves in this country, the Ukrainians have come to see the first American-born generation entering the threshold of maturity. Whereas the others came at a time when the country was undeveloped, the Ukrainians came at the time when industry was reaching its peak of production; and that itself was to some extent a calamity.",
                "Kid ourselves as much as we will about equal opportunities, we cannot help but realize that the \"first come, first served\" rule applies to life as well as it does to movie seats. The older the immigration the larger percentage of those immigrants that create is a well-to-do class with its appendages of social, economic and political influences. The fact that the older immigrations came at a time when this nation welcomed them only improved, or rather had real opportunities thrust upon them, whereas the arrival of the Ukrainians at the time of industrial broadest development enticed them into the factory and its affiliates and thus stunned their natural development which would have come had they settled on the soil. This is the fundamental difference between the Ukrainian settlers of Canada and the Ukrainian industrial workers of the U.S.A.; the Canadian was transferred from soil to soil which he knew and loved and the American was transferred from the soil to the factory and mine which were strange to him and where he got lost. The new surroundings and conditions owed him and in the hum of industrial life and activity the immigrant was charmed and set to wondering. He began to question himself about how soon he'll be able to save $500, $1000, $5,000, etc., and go back to the old country, buy lots of land, and be a first-class \"hospodar\" . As the years rolled by he kept on wondering, and the children kept on wondering.",
                "Now that children are wondering away the fathers are beginning to take notice of their children's presence, and their interest is aroused. What is the trouble? It is not that the fathers were not patriotic, in their sense. They always seemed to respond to different appeals to support the Ukrainian cause. The simple trouble is that the appeals were always one sided. The constant calls were for material help to the other side. One thing was forgotten and that was the true aim of the Ukrainian cause: Perpetuation. Even the free Ukraine would not be of any great mutual benefit if that freedom was to be short-lived. We have had a taste of that. We are striving for a lasting freedom of a nation and consequently should prepare a lasting army of its supporters who may have to wage a lasting battle to the finish. We need perpetuating generations of nationally conscious Ukrainians. Unfortunately all that was take for granted as far as the immigration went.",
                "True enough, the older generation has built some fine institutions; but now that the time is approaching when the fathers will pass away, the problem of these institutions looms up to the front--are the young folks ready for it? To say the least, the problem that the fathers are facing is not a simple one.",
                "In dealing with the children we must first consider the parents who have their greatest influence over them. These folks may be divided into two types. There is the indifferent parent and we may be certain that the children of such are practically bound to be the same. Then we have the second type and that is the serious or trying type that deserves all the consideration. According to the old country tradition, the father's word should be \"law\" whether it is logical or not. Not knowing much about American life, the parents expect the child to obey. The child on the other hand, confronted with a strange request made without an explanation, rebels and refuses to obey. Whatever may follow one may be sure that the child will be constantly on guard and suspecting that all \"old country\" notions must be just as ridiculous. Very often this first encounter is the cause of a lasting and an irreparable breach. The above cites the stern father.",
                "Now we have another type of a parent whose inferiority complex results in a similar breach between parent and child and that is the \"dividing parent.\" How often have we heard, \"It must be so because Johnny said so.\" Whether Johnny knows that he is alive or not is another question but because he finished elementary school and possibly is floating through high school, the mother sees in him the incarnation of all wisdom, even though her plain common sense must have told her more than once that his requests were unreasonable. But then this is America; everything is different. Results: parents always wrong, parents looked down upon as ignorant, all the Ukrainians judged in the same light, and the Ukrainian cause is given the same consideration.",
                "Coming to the topic of the young folks themselves, we must divide them into two groups, also. (Please bear in mind that throughout I'm speaking in generalities; there are exceptions to all rules). In the first group belong the grown ups. If these are not nationally conscious they are lost.\" You can't teach an old dog new tricks.\" In exceptional cases you might arouse interest but hardly a fever or devotion to a cause--not even money can do that. That takes up to the second group which consists of youth's growing up. Their life is a detached life; detached because the elders have been constantly detaching them from their own circle. This alienation process has been worked in different ways. I have mentioned the stern father and the divining mother. I must mention the foolish laughter of the elders at the children who in all earnest endeavor to learn, mispronounce Ukrainian words. Then we have the unnecessary long church hours which turns away so many boys and girls, and that is quite an important factor because our churches are our oldest institutions here, they are our oldest gathering places, social centers. While the fathers live they may be able to force the children to attend church, but what is going to happen to the churches later? The other alienating influence are our plays, entertainments and lack of inducements.",
                "Naturally the question of \"what is there to be done\" comes in its logical sequence. The answer, is short, is: teach the elders and induce the young. About the first part of the advice a lot has been written by various contributors to our Ukrainian papers but like all enterprising novelties, it must be sold--sold by constant advertising. The elders must be taught how to respect their own nationality,--their own customs and their own institutions,--but respect intelligently. Just as an example let's take the Christmas holiday, observed by us by the Julian calendar. It is a usual question which the children ask:",
                "\"Why must our Christmas be so late?\" I know that a lot of our people are abolishing our Christmas time on their own initiative or on their children's advice, and the natural result, as far as the children are concerned, is another defeat for the parents and their \"old country notions.\" Now a logical answer would: \"Our Christmas time has been kept since Christ was born, and the other was introduced only a few hundred years ago; so which deserves more consideration?\" (After all as far as calendars go, if we were to use the right date, neither of the established dates would be right).",
                "Intelligent respect for our own is of great importance in the upbringing of our children. Intelligent respect to our own tongue will eliminate a lot of that alienating effect. Just emagine: a young girl or boy is trying her or his best to get the tongue around a certain syllable but fails--the parents, and perhaps some present friends, burst out with a roar of laughter. A big joke (considering that the elders who have lived here ten, fifteen, and twenty years have not even tried to learn the pronounciation of their adopted language, yet expect the youngster to learn their strange tongue in a fraction of that time without any guidance--while other people have to pay hundreds of dollars to learn the same.",
                "It is not that those elders mean any harm,--for from it. They certainly did not know any better and through their ignorance build, up the very wall which they want to eradicate.",
                "Help the youngsters. True enough, the mispronouncement is funny at times but then erase the effect of the laughter by an explanation of why it is funny and correct and accent or what not, and both the child and advisor will benefit by it. The youngster will remember the mistake because of the mirth it produced and the elder will gain the respect of the child because of the source of knowledge that the elder will appear to represent. On the other hand, if there is no reason to laugh, then for goodness sake, don't. The greatest satisfaction that I have had was to hear on similar occasions some bright youngster pop up the question, \"Why do you laugh? What's so funny about it?\" In some cases the question had a sobering effect.",
                "We must induce young folks to respect and cherish our ideals. The form of inducement may be classed as local and national.",
                "If we consider the smaller town as a locality we are faced with a small Ukrainian colony and unless it is a farming section, it is a compact colony where the members are in close touch with each other. Having one meeting place it becomes their social center, where all entertainments are held and where the children get their only information about their father's homeland. Unfortunately, the information gained by the youngsters is not of the homeland out of the environments in which they live, of the conditions which influence the elders the most. The children are allowed to watch the card playing and drinking and drinkfilled stage performances which stagnate even to this day. Result: the children form an opinion in their plastic age and the opinion is: the old country is the same so why bother about it. Keep the children away from the private bar and its profits. Choose your plays as carefully as you would choose a guardian over your children, and having chosen them try in a cooperative manner to persuade the young folks to participate in those clean plays. A few monetary prizes for the young participants of the understanding performances will serve a special inducements. Forget the profit; think of the mutual gain.",
                "In larger cities the conditions have improved to some extent. There is some concentration of intellectual forces which naturally take a lead. But on the other hand, the diverging forces in the large city colonies are much greater. Therefore it is necessary to center on the national form of inducement which has more influence in the large cities and which through that influence involves the smaller colonies as well.",
                "The Ukrainians must have, by all means, their own native schools of quality. So far, with the exception of some Canadian institutions, I have not heard of permanently established quality schools. It is that lasting curse among us which must be fought at all costs. Profit! Something for nothing! False profit!. And soon we will be reaping the lost gain. There should be no one in a colony as important as the teacher in our native schools--I mean qualified teachers who may be entrusted with the molding of young characters. Let us forget about the one-in-all combination: teacher--deacon, janitor and general abuse mongrel. Stop wasting your pennies. One good man could cover three to five colonies with the minimum cost to the individual group and with the maximum benefit to all concerned. A central guiding institution is needed to coordinate this work and I hope that the recent movement in that direction will materialize.",
                "We must awaken the pride of the young folks in our own institutions. In this respect, forgetting some of the faults in his endeavors, there can be no doubt that V. Avramenko's dancing organizations have blazed a trail of great significance. The organizing ability of the man should be capitalized to every extent in this new school movement.",
                "Considering all the phases of our life in this country, we find one thing lacking, and lacking sorely. No matter how, the most important thing, in order to get the young person's attention, is to appeal to his or her feeling. We can do so by mouth or written word. The first means is out of question physically. That leaves us the possibilities of the written word, further, to appeal through writing, the person must be well acquainted with the medium of expression, and naturally to an American born Ukrainian the English word is the most effective medium of expression or transmission of thought.",
                "Herein we are sorely in need of Ukrainian literature in the English language. We need to encourage young people to specialize in literature, and through substantial renumerations we must induce them to write. The large central institutions are in the best position to undertake this move. It must be a continuous annual subsidy or fund; otherwise the power of inducement would be nullified. What rich sources of Ukrainian historic material and what possibilities of parallelization with the history of this continent!",
                "We are living through a period of Ukraine's greatest upheaval. Ukraine is transformed into land of martyrs. This fact should be utilized by the Ukrainian papers. Where life is at stake, no means should be spared to impress the young of the bestiality of the killer. The impression is lasting and is taken to heart. If we are to develop fighting supporters of a mutual cause, we must present in a true light the reason for our battle. To this end, more material should be printed in English, for the general dissemination of the news.",
                "In conclusion I must say that a lot of the suggestions cannot be followed out as long as we have party frictions and go to the extent of letting party prejudice come before a mutual aim. We must admit that the older generation will finish its existence in the same attitude, but the coming generation has none of these obstacles to handicap its progress.",
                "There must be a full recognition of this fact and all nationalistic groups must meet and formulate a common line of endeavor in tackling this \"wondering\" problem which might be neglected too long. Regardless of the party, we have one aim and must train our children to see it in the same light and work hand in hand for the same cause. If we don't there will be no one else to do it; so, since it must be done sooner or later, why not try to do it now? And it is up to the Ukrainian professional men, especially those in the ranks of the younger generation, to lend their shoulders to this problem in which they are bound to play the main guiding part.",

He then spent a year of graduate work at the same University--this time specializing in Education--and received distinction in his work. In September, 1932, having been awarded a two year fellowship by the Social Research Council of Mc. Gill University, Montreal, he embarked on the study of Sociology, and in 1934 was awarded the M. A. degree. He next won a fellowship at the Institute of Human Relations of Yale University, and entered Yale in October 1934 to continue his studies in Sociology. Last May he obtained a renewal of his fellowship for next year, and in addition was awarded a scholarship. The following year, then, Mr. Mamchur will continue his Ph. D. studies in Yale.",

                "Mr. Chairman, Reverend Fathers, Ladies and Gentlemen:",
                "I have chosen to speak on the \"Orientation of the Ukrainian-American Student,\" and as I go on, I shall make clear with what particular phases of this general topic I shall deal. In order, however, that you may understand why I make the suggestions which I shall make later on in my talk, I find it necessary to describe very briefly what I regard to be the REALITY of the situation of the Ukrainians in America. And this description of what I call the reality of the situation of the Ukrainians in America is, in greater or lesser degree, similar to that of any other nationality which has migrated to America. In other words, let me sketch what the essence of the general immigrant situation is.",
                "It needs no explanation to grasp the fact that an immigrant is one who has moved from one cultural milieu to another. That is, when one moves, he moves not as a simple physical skeleton, he moves as a personality; as an individual who has a certain language, a certain religion, certain occupational abilities, skills and attitudes, certain political experiences, certain manners and usages in connection with marriage and family life and that goes to make up living. In other words, the immigrant comes with a culture (based on his historical experience) which, though it may not be vastly different from that somewhat-hard-to-define American Culture is it yet different from the latter in some degree. It is for that reason that the immgrant-in order to live as a human-being-i.e. to express himself according to his culture--establishes various institutions, \"Societies\" the church, the press, the mutual benefit organizations, the dramatic and literary clubs, choral groups, and the organizations which aim primarily at helping those of his nationality abroad. Now these series of institutions constitute, by and large, the \"world\" in which the immigrant in America lives. It could not be otherwise; true, he works usually in American institutions, and has other commercial contacts with the latter; when children grow up they are important American-culture carriers into the home, and thus also contribute somewhat to the change of the culture of the parents. But essentially the immigrant participates little in the American world; his distinct culture, coupled with the fact that he comes with an occupational background which sets him upon his arrival here in the lowest occupational class in the country--that of unskilled labor not only serves to keep him apart from the American world, but actually makes Ukrainian society of tremendous value to him. This immigrant society, at first constituted to admit the individuals's culture expression, later serves in turn to actually preserve his old world culture--his national identity. Hence, by and large, though the culture of the immigrant changes, the degree of change is small; he is essentially a Ukrainian and as such he dies.",
                "But the situation is very different with his descendants, those born in America, a certain amount of Ukrainian culture is transmited to them through the homes and through familiar participation in the immigrant society; but the primary fact that from the age of six or so they attend American educational institutions, coupled with all that that signifies,--means that the attitudes and values of the children--their culture--will be very different from that of their parents;--they become progressively less Ukrainian, and simultaneusly more American. Some may become completely identified with American culture. But whether or not that happens in the second generation,--it is inevitable in later generations; one may remember his national ancestry but that is all. His interests have become the interests of those about him; and their culture is--American.",
                "This process is not peculiar to Ukrainians; it is a fundamental social law; it represents what happens to any nationality (not race, e.g. Japanese--for this introduces complicating factors of physical features, e.g. color) in the situation of the immigrant. To put it briefly: Assimilation is inevitable whether we like it or not; it cannot be stemmed though it may be delayed. And it is largely with the situation which delays it that I shall deal.",
                "To return to my original statement, then, if we are realists--if we look squarely at the fact in the situation, whether or not they please us or others--we shall have to admit that the Ukrainian cultural carryover in America, with its attendant institutions and organizations, though an essential, and in most ways a beneficial, process--is, at the same time, merely a transition-al one--one of temporary duration--unless, of course, immigration is renewed.",
                "It is, then, to this reality situation of the inevitability of assimilation that the second generation of Ukrainians in America those born here--have to orient themselves. This orientation has two sides: First, that which refers more particularly to the Ukrainian aspect; and, secondly, that which refers to the American Social Situation. The two are interlinked, but for purposes of exposition, I shall treat them arbitrarily as if they were distinct.",
                "But, let me say, that I treat of the problem as it confronts particularly the student, and, I am not thinking, except in certain individual cases, of those of the first generation. And by \"student\", I do not mean necesserily one who is at least a graduate of some university. Whoever has a live interest in life, whoever seeks knowledge, whoever attempts to unravel the so called \"secrets\" of the physical and the social world, is a student, a scholar in the true sense of the word. There is a world of difference between mere schooling and education; the fact that you are here is, I would say, in itself testimony that you are all students in the very best sense of the word-whether or not you may exhibit diplomas and the like. So in a sense, what I say, refers to all those present here.",
                "Well, then, what is to be your attitude towards what I may term the \"Ukrainian question\"? This Ukrainian question is a sort of a double-edged sword; one with one face towards the Ukrainians in America, the other, referring to the lot of Ukrainians abroad. I shall deal with each of these aspects in order.",
                "How many times have you, as a student in high school or university had to listen to some grave person indict you somewhat as follows; \"Why don't you speak Ukrainian more often or more fluently, and accurately? Why don't you develop yourself in written Ukrainian? Why don't you know more about Ukraine's culture, her glorious past, her achievements and disaster? Why don't you know more Ukrainian history, literature, art?...Why don't you tell the world you're Ukrainian, boast about it, and never miss an opportunity to emphasize your national ancecestry? Why don't you read more Ukrainian newspapers? Why don't you belong to a Ukrainian dramatic society? Choral group? literary club? Young people's club? Why don't you attend Ukrainian functions more often...",
                "Why, in the world, don't you 'stick' with Ukrainians,..and so on, and so on, the monologue continues; irrelevant examples from other nationalities are cited and sure enough the bewildered Ukrainian-American thinks he or she has committed the unpardonable sin, has been sort of snivelling knave, a renegade to some sort of a \"sacred\" ideal that should have been all but apotheosized!",
                "Now let us \"dissect\" this indictment against Ukrainian-Americans, particularly students, and see how much sound sense it contains. The policy, by implication, advocated therein, I shall call, the Isolationist Policy--for certainly, if followed literally, its effect would be to isolate Ukrainian-American from contact with other Americans, from those of a different national background than Ukrainian, from those, in fact, with whom we live--and with whom we should naturally associate at least as much as with Ukrainians. Now, remember, to be sure, I am all for us having a better command of Ukrainian; an acquaintance with several languages is certainly a mark of a scholar. Then, again, the fact that most of our parents are fluent in only their native language menas that we need to, and shall, pick up at least a working knowledge of Ukrainian....I am also all for us knowing more about the culture and tradition of our nationality--of course, that too, is a mark of a scholar...I do, again, recognize that there is no necessity for being apologetic about our national ancestry. I do, further, recognize a moderate participation in Ukrainian Societies. After all, we belong to families--and, if for no other reason than that, we should participate in these organizations, for they are the only ones in which our parents, by and large, can participate; our partial participation in them tends, then, towards the stability of the family. I also recognize the superb and almost incalculable self-expression in such forms of art as music, folk-song, drama, dance, handicrafts, etc. I recognize their educative, their amusement and recreational values, and their function of preservation of the beauty--the resplendent tradition of Ukrainian folk culture...Oh yes, full well I realize how much poorer we would be, how much poorer America would be, without the preservation of those artistic forms of Ukrainian culture, which are not only a balm to the weary Ukrainian soul, but are a dessert (as it were) which has a universal appeal, which is not confined to Ukrainian tastes--which is, in a word, a universal language, so beautiful, and in many cases, incomparable, peerless! Oh yes--I thrill at the colorful Ukrainian costumes; at the melody and pathos of the song--the song which strikes a note in human hearts which, I dare say, no other national song can. Oh yes, the opportunities to recite, to act in dramas, to sing--which are afforded to Ukrainian- American children by these Ukrainian societies-are of incalculable value to the children. They give them a means and a mode of self-expression, of artistic individual development. And again, full well, I realize the purely amusement and recreational value of some of those organizations. In our impersonalized city-life these societies provide a need which might, otherwise, find our young people on street corners, in taverns, with gangs---and what not. This much, then, I recognize--and more, as far as it pertains to those who are not strictly students.",
                "But, the indictment against us--which I have termed \"the isolationist policy\"--cannot be taken too seriously--to the letter. As far as the student is concerned, it is a matter of practicable policy. Here he is in America, born here, and here he shall live--and fare well or fare worse. The fundamental in controvertible fact simply is that if we are going to achieve those posts in the economic and social life of this country--those posts to which our abilities entitle us--we must, of necessity, identify ourselves with Americans. Does that necessitate any unusual rational policy? No--it means simply following the \"natural\" course. To the student, it means that his associations will have to be largely not exclusively, with those who share his interests; i. e. largely, with other students irrespective of their nationality. I said, to the student it is a matter of practicable policy. And it is. If he were, for example, to take the isolationist seriously, he would be spending the time which he should spend at his studies (in order to excel), or at his special interests, or in social contact with students in his field--he would be spending this time, I say, in rehearsal for, and presentations of, Ukrainian plays, concerts, dances, studies, on committee and executive work, etc., etc. Time, after all, is limited; and two jobs cannot be done well at the same time. Attention to studies must come first-and this necessitates a mild boycott, perhaps temporary, of everything else. Secondly, we hear so much sheer undiluted \"bunk\" about the prejudice of Americans towards Ukrainians. I have looked for this all my life and I have not found it, except in the vaporings of unadjusted fanatics. True enough, there is a certain antipathy because of competition and strangeness; but remember, when the American knows us he regards us on our merits--without regard to our national ancestry. And it is up to us--by mixing--to get to know the American, and simultaneously, he will get to know us. In other words, a policy of contact--not isolation--is the one which will guarantee to us that place in the American social order to which our abilities entitle us. As far as the student is concerned, the policy of isolation can only relegate him to the lowest economic strata from which, by difficult degrees, our parents had to rise.",
                "Let me emphasize this point by a sketch example from Canada. There is one school of thought among Ukrainians there which is isolationist in the extreme. The group in control is interested, (as a matter of fact, for its own existence) in Ukrainian students living in the so-called Ukrainian Institutes. These institutes isolate the Ukrainian student almost completely from all but the most ephemeral kind of contacts with Canadians; and they indoctrinate the students with a vicious isolationist philosophy. The consequence is that the Ukrainian student, after he has been at the Institute anywhere from 1 to 8 years, he comes out an absolute stranger to Canadians. He is a species of \"true\" Ukrainian, I'll admit, but he is totally unfit to take his place among Canadians. Unaccepted there, he turns back to Ukrainians, becomes a virtual parasite, is embittered against Canadians, and finds it expedient to continue propagandizing the isolationist policy of the Institutes. And so the cycle of isolationism goes merrily on.",
                "Let us never forget that those who advocate, explicitly or implicitly, a literal following of the isolationist policy (which I briefly set forth a while ago in that monologue), are not personally disinterested. Some may advocate it because of a deep sentimental attachment to the old world--only natural in the immigrant.",
                "Others advocate it because they live off the organizations which they beg us to support and participate in. But whatever the motives are, the simple fact is, that they neither understand nor appreciate the problem of the Ukrainian--American. We have to take our choice between isolationism, and consequent relagation to bring hewers of wood and drawers of water for Americans; and, the policy of contact in the widest sense, and consequent successful economic and social adjustment. There are no other alternatives. Fanatic Ukrainians we may be--and remain a sort of a caste in this country; or, realists we may be--and take our place in American social structure after the fashion of our abilities. The choice is yours.",
                "Now--as to our orientation towards the problem of Ukrainian independence abroad. We hear, you know, under the guise of this, a lot of unadulterated non-sense, and it would take me beyond the scope of my address to detail this subject. The central facts, however, as they appear to us are simply these. History illuminates us sufficiently to make us feel absolutely certain that so long as the general world social organization is what it is, no sizeable cultural group such as that of the Ukrainians, can develop, can express itself as human in the fullest sense of the word, so long as it is under the domination of a state (or states) ruled by a different nationality. In other words, the logic and the facts for Ukrainian independence for a Ukrainian state based on Ukrainian culture, we accept from the outset. Here is a mass of humanity, consisting of some forty five million souls who, under foreign subjection have been, and are still being, reduced to a condition worse than that of serfdom. I need not elaborate on this.",
                "On purely humanitarian grounds, then, I would, to the limit of my ability and circumstances, help in the struggle of this group for freedom. But we have an additional reason for being interested in the fate of these people: We are their descendants, our very fathers and mothers have experienced some of the bitter taste of servility to foreign masters. Their fate, then, is of very close personal emotional concern to us. If we do not help them, who else will, I would say then, that we should be interested in, and should be ardent supporters of, the struggle for Ukrainian independence abroad, and should contribute to it in our distinct ways--in whatever way we are best equipped to do so.",
                "But our attitude to the world Ukrainian situation cannot stop here--i. e. with the mere support of any or every organization or party which allegedly seeks this independence of Ukraine. And here I am advocating nothing; I am merely asking you to study the so-called programs and policies of the varied Ukrainian organizations here which have a reference to the old world situation. And do not be \"dupes,\"--pardon the expression--do not swallow without masticating what you hear from the platform and in the press. Study the propaganda and the educational aspect of these organizations. Why this, Simply because, though these organizations have one thing in common--desire for Ukrainian independence, i. e. the desire for the establishment of Ukrainian state, they do differ, and at times radically, as to the means whereby this independence is to be achieved; and secondly of (sic) the social order which we are to have after having achieved independence. Now--remember--these two latter aspects of the situation are (as) important as the first; but it here where there is almost illimitable scope for divergent policies. Those at the helm of these organizations in America know this very well; They know that it is easy to unite Ukrainians on the question of the desire for Ukrainian independence, but they also know that it is not as easy to secure the undivided support of Ukrainians for a particular mode of achieving this independence, or for a particular social organization which we shall presumably have after we have established our state. And so--for their own success--some of these organizations \"soft-pedal\" these two aspects in their propaganda; the consequence is that we are apt to get the notion that the only important aspect about the situation is whether or not we want Ukrainian independence....you should study this for yourself, because, as I have said, these organizations, despite their ignoring of these aspects in their propaganda, do have a fairly specific philosophy as to how the Ukrainian state is to be achieved, and what form it will take. And these matters are important! Granting the desire for Ukrainian independence, can we continue to hope and pray for some miracle to occur through the tangled nets of European diplomacy, or must we rely, first and foremost, on revolutionary techniques, I am not solving the question for you--I am merely posing it! And secondly, whichever method we adopt to support, the price our people will pay will be no small price--no mean sacrifice of lives, of property, and of culture. It is well to reflect, then, that what we do achieve will be worth the price--to phrase it crudely--for we might have merely an exchange of masters with no essentially significant change in individual human liberation. To put it concretely--without stateing my view--do we want the armageddon of fascism? Do we want half-baked parliamentary republicanism with capitalists as the boys chuckling behind their grim visage?, do we want some nonentity as a monarch whose sole concern shall be to keep his crown, do we want some temblance of socialism, or do we want undiluted socialism? All these--and other, possibilities--are implicitly or explicitly, in the program of the parties which beckon our support. And all I say is, that the differences do matter--and you, as students, should acquaint yourselves with the facts, and not be ensnared into supporting something which in your senses you would never dream of supporting...so much for your orientation, as students, to the double-edged Ukrainian problem.",
                "Now, as to the more specifically American orientation. If you continue to be students, according to my definition, whether or not you are being \"schooled,\" you will find--if you have not yet--that this is a very anomalous (if not \"crazy\") sort of a world. You will see our so-called democracy fanatically attached to so-called education; at the same time you will see each year thousands of graduates of high school and college discovering that not only a good part of the education which was supposed to enlighten them, has been absolutely \"mum\" --silent--on some of the greatest personal and social problems they shall have to face; but also that this \"education\", which was supposed to be a sort of an entree into this job or that, leaves them facing blind alleys... you will see young people wrecked through inability to get a job, and consequently inability to get married, etc... you will see the country teeming with hoboes who can secure no attachment anywhere... you will see our divorce mills going full blast--and many families being that but in name (sic)...you will witness anticrime campaingns, antivice crusades, and temperance battles...you will see our rate of mental illnesses rising year by year; you may even brand this a neurotic nation...you will see all sort of \"social agencies,\" annual \"mobilizations for human needs.\" You will find sort of respectable men and women--largely financiers--supporting these social services--which, by the way, is fairly logical, since it is through their hold on our economic system that these very human problems are created...you will see--yes--witness strikes and walk--outs; \"the big bosses\" will not recognize the demands of labor; labor strikes, and the city or state suffers a hundredfold the difference of the wage dispute in question. You will see three quarters of our population in wretched misery, barely existing. You will witness the anomaly of a government drive for acreage reduction; you will see cotton plowed under or tomatoes dumped in the ocean because, they say, \"there is no one to buy these things\"--yet the larger proportion of our population is without reasonable necessities of life. You will see, on the one side, million dollar heiresses cavorting with princes and counts, and on the other, you will see a poor mother with half a dozen children trying to live on six dollars a week. Honest, sincere attempts at partial reform will be met by \"grass rooters\" euphemistically sounding the death--knell of the fetish constitution. And if you look beyond the national horizon you will see every nation spending the major portion of its annual budget in preparation for carnal warfare...you will hear talk of free speech, free press--yet you will find that if you suggest honest critisism of anything in our order you will have real difficulty in finding a newspaper in the country which would publish it...you will continue to hear lip-service to ideals; love, justice, charity, brotherhood--all a mockery--for we pay but lip-service to these; doing but this, yet we delude ourselves that we have the reality of these ideals. And so on--and so on, one could go without end enumerating or \"castigating\" the social problems that beset us. The fact is that all is not well with this world. And try as we may, we cannot convince ourselves that these things are due to some visitation of divine wrath--although that may be the ultimate explanation--or to anything a magical nature. The social problems that beset us have a social origin;",
                "They can be studied much as physical disease is studied, and are equally--on their level--\"curable.\"",
                "Let me emphasize this point. The scientific method came to be applied seriously to the study of the physical phenomena of the universe some centuries ago. We had, as a consequence the evolution of the sciences of physics, chemistry, biology, astronomy, and their allies--and through these science and their application, various inventions were made, various \"problems\" of the physical universe were \"settled\"--as it were. But there is evidently no limit to man's ingenuity, to his ability to invent, and, at the same time, there appears to be no limit to the necessity for invention. For example, the biological sciences have unraveled the process of various diseases, but much yet remains in the field of the unknown. And so these scientists continue their investigations. As a partial consequence of the varied inventions made as a result of the finding of the physical sciences, the so-called \"industrial revolution\" was ushered in; it added to the social problems. But the outstanding fact is that scientific method in the physical realm has given us a tremendously wide control over physical nature. In the realm of human relations; i. e. society--the relations of humans to one another--we are still largely helpless. We witness delinquency, marital discord, crime, mental illnesses, poverty in the midst of plenty, periodic depressions, and all the catastrophic effects associated with these, we witness human slaughter on a world-wide scale--and we seem to be able to do little about all these social plagues of humanity. Now, if we are ever to secure the control in the social realm which we have been able to secure in the physical realm we must study society as we study germs, atoms, molecules, friction, light, mechanics, etc. This is admitted; I need not re-emphasize it. But there has been a long lag in the scientific study of society; until about the end of the last century men, sat in cosy armchair and philosophized about society. This has changed in a revolutionary manner. Students of society today no longer build beautiful deductive systems about society; they have applied the inductive method of the physical science to its study. And the results so far have been as encouraging as can be expected. Science works by slow degrees; but already the social scientists have a good deal of authoritative scientific formulations some light on our economic problems, on problems of personality, on our political organization, etc. And this is one of the paths we must follow if we are not to be engulfed by the armageddon of revolution or obliteration by war--if we are to forstall the annual toll of human wreckage which an archaic system takes today.",
                "You as students, then cannot put much stock in the vaporing of politicians; most of them are--if I may use an anology--\"hired donkeys\" who must bray and act as their master--usually the industrialist who contributes to their campaign funds--bids them. They are no more free--though they may think otherwise--than is the bird in a cage. And so their platitudes about the constitution, about liberty, individualism, etc., are but a smoke screen to hide the facts. And you must get at the facts, not assume that they can be \"manufactured\" for you, and served on a silver platter, as it were, by those who are supposed to be our political leaders. In a word--study society, in an unbiassed manner; if you have academic ambition, I might suggest that you turn to the field of social sciences for that is where the greatest discoveries are yet to be made, where the greatest contribution is possible. Understand the society you live in. Let the varied problems that beset us, which cannot escape your eyes, and which often have a personal reference to you yourselves. Let them be to you a stimulus to study. For it is only by understanding the society in which you live, that you can become intelligent co-operators in its reconstruction. You have the advantage of some schooling, of some leisure--you can, therefore, study; the unskilled laborer whose life centers around the factory must need look to you for guidance; whether you will it or not, yours is the leadership role; whether you lead well or ill depends on how true you are to the ideal of the student.",
                "Hold that banner high--for it is indispensable for a peaceful progressive adjustment of various social forms to the fundamental technological and economic changes which occur from time to time. An apathetic, lackadaisical attitude will only find you swept unknowingly into the maelstrom of worse ills than those besetting the American society today."

                "The most complicated problem among the foreign citizens of the United States is to distinguish between emigration and immigration laws and passport regulations. Many immigrants living in America came here from the middle and eastern parts of Europe, where the consequences of the large European war began incredible changes in the states' rights, which up to today are not settled and reflect disadvantageously on the American immigrants who came from those countries. Many of them would like to go back to the old country or bring their families to America, but due to the abnormal situation and the rapid changes in the occupied territories by hostile nations, this is not easy to accomplish, because the American lawmakers adjust themselves to these abnormal European situation which is often changing, or are remedying the emigration and immigration procedure and the passport regulations, which must be followed along that line.",
                "But alas! often the immigrants cannot speak the English language fluently enough to express themselves clearly. On this complicated question, and as a result of it, many a cheating agent profits by it a great deal, taking advantage of the immigrant to a point that is virtually impossible.",
                "This is oftentimes found among the Ukrainian immigrants who mostly come from the Eastern Galicia, Bakuvinia and Carpathian Ukraine. A long time ago these countries belonged to the Austrian monarchy, and now, with the agreement of the Peace Conference at Paris, these Ukrainians were partitioned: Eastern Galicia was ceded to Poland; Bakuvinia to Roumania; Carpathian Ukraine to Czechoslovakia. On account of this the Ukrainian immigrants have more difficulty in communicating with the old country than for instance, Italy, or some other country. When they are leaving America they frequently do not know how or to whom they should go for a passport, and sometimes fall in the hand of merciless cheaters.",
                "So, to remedy this and to protect the immigrant from exploitation, the American Red Cross opened a Foreign Language Bureau in New York, which gives actual advice to foreigners in the cases of various laws of the United States, among them laws about coming to America and going to Europe. From the first of February, that is, from the time since the opening of the information bureau to the 30th of June of this year, 667 people turned to this information bureau for advice as to bringing their families to America; 972 people turned to the information bureau for advice on leaving America; 652 persons wanted to have their passports made out through it. It is understood that the information bureau cannot issue passports, but gives advice in which way they can be more easily obtained.",
                "During the time of the existence of the information bureau for the foreigners, which was put up by the American Red Cross, (it) helped and satisfied a few thousand people who turned to them for advice. Many of those are Ukrainians who number 750,000 in the United States of America.",
                "The Foreign Information Bureau, in which there is a Ukrainian branch, has its representative from Washington, who is well informed on the government organs, and notifies the Ukrainian branch of the information bureau about all changes and improvements of the government laws concerning foreign settlers in the United States."

Due largely to the efforts of the church, the sparks remained alive, to be fanned into a considerable flame when the winds of nationalism swept across Europe in the 19th century. The Guild of Saints Cyril and Methodius, founded in Kiev in 1846 by a group of Ukrainian writers to promote the movement, was suppressed within a year by the government of Nicholas I.

First he claimed that the Ukrainian language never existed, and then he had the audacity to turn right around and say that the Ukrainian language must not exist.

Over 200,000 Russian soldiers and officers wanted to enlist in the American army for small pay. Vopicka cabled the American government that a force of 200,000 fighting Russians could be enlisted at the front to establish order in the Ukraine and to effectually check the rising tide of Bolshevism. He begged for immediate approval of this plan, and action to finance the organization, but the approval came too late. The willing Russians had already left the front to return to their homes.",

During the year 1638, Bogdan Khmelitzky and the Cossacks started a march upon Poland to regain their homeland from the Polish despots. On this march Khmelnitzky conquered town after town, city after city, until he reached a territory which he knew was definitely Ukrainian. Here he was astonished to find that under the influence of the Polish despots, the Ukrainian people were fighting against his own Cossacks. Not wanting to harm his own people, he decided to investigate the cause of this change.

The Ukrainian people were forced to attend the Roman Catholic Church, and all Orthodox teachings were abolished. Besides, the Ukrainians were forced to speak Polish only. Gradually, Khmelnitzky's men spread a burning flame which reached the hearts of these Polonized Ukrainians. They explained to them that they were at heart Ukrainians, and not Poles. And that they should join Khmelnitzky to free their homeland. It was apparent that due to the severe oppression of the Polish lords, after patiently waiting for years for the liberation of Ukraine, these Ukrainian peasants slowly forgot their true identity and gradually were intermarrying with the Poles. Nevertheless, a flame was lit in the hearts of the Ukrainian people. They deserted the Polish ranks, joined Khmelnitzky and fought with him until Ukraine again became independent.",

                "Compelled to live out of our country, we Ukrainians were deeply touched by your generous intervention in behalf of our native land by your bill, introduced in the Senate of the United States of America, which recommended the recognition by the United States Government of an independent Ukraine. This bill reflects the great importance of self-determination of nations, a principle which actuated us in the year 1917-18 after the downfall of the Russian Empire, and upon which the wish of the Ukrainian nation for independence was based, as was so strikingly manifested by the voice of our people in 1917. Thus in 1917 the Ukraine became an independent country with a republican form of government, and later in 1918 it became a state under the leadership of a hetman. These achievements were later nullified by the violence of the Russian Bolsheviks, who, having conquered and subjugated the country, merely granted it a fictitious independence under the nominal title of \"Ukrainian Soviet Socialistic Republic\", and the country became, in fact, a colony for Bolsheviks and was held in a slave-like independence under Bolshevik rule. With the country overrun and occupied by the Moscow Bolsheviks, the Ukrainian nation at once raised protests against this act of violence. The repeated peasant uprisings, general armed resistance against the oppressors, and lastly the flight of virtually the entire Ukrainian cultured class to other European countries, as well as to America and Asia, furnished proof of the Ukrainian protests against the Bolshevik occupation.",
                "Imbued with the lofty principle of independence, every Ukrainian abroad put all his energies into the effort to influence public opinion regarding the deplorable state of affairs in his country under the Bolshevik yoke. This is the reason your splendid action is of such predominant moral importance and force to the Ukrainian cause, and why we hope that it may be instrumental in bringing about important results in our struggle for the liberation of our country. While we are expressing our sincere gratitude to you, permit us at the same time to draw your attention to an important fact which, it seems to us, you did not especially dwell upon in your bill. Among the Ukrainians abroad, as well as among those who live upon the Ukrainian territory, there are two different political groups which, although each seeks to achieve an independent Ukraine, differ in their views as to the ultimate political structure of that country. One group strives for an independent Ukraine under a republican form of government, while the other, with which we ourselves are affiliated, hopes for an independent Ukraine under the leadership of a hetman, in accordance with our historical and traditional form of government. This latter form of government existed during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and was restored by Hetman Skoropadsky. In sympathizing with and welcoming your action in behalf of the independent Ukraine, we believe that your support of the cause as expressed by your bill did not embrace the idea of any particular form of government for an independent Ukraine. However, we are fully convinced that the form of government which is most universally approved, and which most nearly approaches our national principles and ideals, will be and should be selected by the Ukrainian notion."

                "On Monday, October 8, at 8 A.M. the delegates from all Ukrainian societies, fraternities, etc., of Chicago were on hand at the La Salle Station, where the Chorus was to arrive. All the delegates, some of them in national costumes, welcomed the guests with flowers. Among them all the local Sitch District Number Two (Chicago) was best represented. Besides the delegates there was a great number of Ukrainian Chicagoans who came out personally to see and welcome the world-famous Chorus.",
                "The Chorus arrived at 9 A.M. and was instantly surrounded by newspaper reporters. After this ordeal the members formed a semicircle, and Dr. Myroslaw Siemens officially welcomed them in the name of the Ukrainian Chicagoans, and presented Mr. A. Koshets, their conductor, with a grand bouquet of flowers. Mr. N. Motlink uttered a few words of welcome to the Chorus on behalf of the local Ukrainian students.",
                "Mr. Koshets expressed in a few forceful words his appreciation of the welcome which they had accorded to him and to his Chorus. He ended with the exhortation:",
                "\"Give full support to the National Chorus!\"",
                "Immediately after this the delegates took the Chorus to the Auditorium Hotel for breakfast. This was followed by a tour through Chicago's principal streets, places, parks, and buildings of historic value.",
                "On this same day in the evening the Chorus gave a concert in Symphony Orchestra Hall. This journal has not space enough to describe--and furthermore no words could do it--all the feeling and the inspiration that filled the hearts of each and every one present at the concert. It may be of importance to some to know that the hall, containing 3,000 chairs, was filled almost exclusively by Ukrainians. The Ukrainians had anticipated the large attendance and had bought their tickets ahead of time. Many of other nationalities, who did not expect so enormous a crowd, were unable to secure tickets in advance and consequently were included among the thousand and more who had to be turned away. For this reason the announcement was made in the intermission that another concert would be given on November 5 in the Medinah Temple, in a much more spacious hall.",
                "The welcome committee, chosen from various societies, clubs, etc., provided handsome bouquets for Mr. Koshets and the soloists. There were also numerous bouquets from total strangers, as well as from many individual Ukrainians.",
                "After the concert a banquet was arranged at the Congress Hotel in honor of the Ukrainian National Chorus. At the banquet delegates were present from almost every society, club, fraternity, etc., and especially from the Chicago Sitch Organization District Number Two.",
                "At the banquet speech followed speech in honor of Mr. A. Koshets and his famous Chorus.",
                "We must not omit to mention that the banquet was honored with the presence of the Ukrainian Metropolitan Archbishop Count Andrey Sheptytsky.",
                "The speakers were as follows: Dr. M. Siminovich, Dr. S. K. Hrynevetsky, chief executive of the Sitch Organization, who fearlessly and openly spoke his mind as to the difficult agreement between the Ukrainian National Chorus and their impresario Mr. Rabinoff, Dr. Volodimir Siminovich, Dr. S. Yanovich, the Reverend W. Stetsiuk, Metropolitan Archbishop Count Andrey Sheptytsky, S. Museychook, M. Skatchuk, H. Skehar, T. Levtiich, the Reverend L. Van, the Reverend T. Hundiak, P. Novodvorsky, S. Kochy, R. Smook, T. Sawchuk, and others. To all these speeches Professor A. Koshets replied, revealing himself not only a genius of song but also a master of eloquence. The banquet was finished with the Ukrainian hymn sung with subdued voices, \"Ukrainia Still Lives\".",
                "Special thanks are due to Roman Smook, our young attorney, who worked the hardest to make the welcome for the Chorus a success.",
                "The Chorus remained in Chicago a whole week, and therefore Ukrainian Chicagoans had a better chance to talk to its members individually and to learn many things from our native nightingales about conditions in the old country.",
                "On Tuesday the Chorus had a reception and a supper at the residence of the Reverend W. Stetsiuk, where Metropolitan Archbishop Count Sheptytsky resided during his stay in Chicago. The latter now had a chance to become better acquainted with the conductor, Professor Alexander Koshets, and his Chorus.",
                "Here the singers were more at liberty to express and to enjoy themselves. They sang a few church and national songs which will long remain in the memory of the venerable old Archbishop and the rest who were present.",
                "The Reverend Wasyl Stetsiuk verily is an exceptionally generous person and a sincere performer of his duties; he never spares himself nor his money for a good cause. He displayed these excellent traits of character particularly at the funeral of the late Perehowsky, in the illness of Archbishop Sheptytsky, and in the reception of the Chorus at his residence. Three cheers for him for that!",
                "On Friday, November 3, the Ukrainian Orthodox people prepared a welcome supper for the Chorus at 1944 West Erie Street, Chicago. Various speakers had a chance to express themselves at this banquet, but they all unanimously had words of cordial welcome and sincere gratitude for Professor Koshets and the entire Chorus. Mr. Koshets thanked the speakers for their warm words of appreciation as well as for the presents received. Here he described more at length the Ukrainian National Chorus and its traveling mission all over the world. The Chorus did its part and sang a few songs, which pleased those who were present better than anything else would have done.",
                "During the banquet John Barabash's well-known orchestra played.",
                "On Sunday Professor Koshets and his assistant Professor Harry Tuchapsky attended mass in St. Nicholas' Church, at the corner of Oakley Boulevard and Rice Street. Dr. Joseph Nazaruk, special representative from Ukrainia, was also present.",
                "On this same Sunday in the afternoon Professor Koshets was invited to a big meeting called by Dr. Joseph Nazaruk. Requested to speak by the latter as well as by the whole meeting committee, Professor Koshets made an exceptional impression upon the audience with his talk. He showed himself a master of eloquence.",
                "Immediately after the meeting the Ukrainians went to hear the Ukrainian National Chorus at the Medinah Temple. Since the Ukrainians had attended the mass meeting in the afternoon, not many of them were present at the concert; nevertheless the spacious hall was filled almost to capacity by the American public.",
                "The program of the concert was a novelty even to those who had regularly attended all the concerts of the Chorus, and the public was much pleased, since these numbers and the presentation of them were something entirely new to the audience. Miss Nina Koshets sang some of the solos, such as \"Oh, Mother,\" and \"Tra la la!\" May I add that this hall is twice as large as that used for the other concert?",
                "It is next to impossible to describe every singer of the Chorus individually or every number separately. Let our hearts be the judges of what an impression these songs made on the audience. Self-praise gets no one anywhere; therefore let me cite what some of the local American newspapers had to say about the Chorus:",
                "\"Hail and sincere thanks to you, great Conductor A. Koshets, and to your Chorus! You seem to us like your native nightingales.\"",
                "\"Hail to you! By singing about the freedom of Ukrainia, you are strengthening her aims and endeavors.\"",
                "\"We salute you for your divinely melodious way of telling us who you are and what your ancestry is.\"",
                "Sing, therefore, for us and for others! Sing of the famous Sitch of the past and of their dauntless heroes, who with their breasts for bulwarks defended not only Ukrainia but also the whole Western civilization against the savage hordes of Turks and Tartars and other migrating Asiatic tribes for centuries. Tell the world through the medium of song what Ukrainia is: that she is one of the richest countries in the world; that her Cossacks have done far more than their share in the preservation of Western civilization and culture for many centuries. Through the medium of our song make the world recognize the immortal fame and glory of the Ukrainian Cossacks, saviors of European culture.",

Both your material help and protests, history cannot and will not forget nor slight. Yet, from you, who are real Ukrainians, not only in name but also in deed, Ukrainia expects much more than that which you have just done, because in America no Polish blackjacks nor Russian detectives are threatening you for your cultural activities. There you are free to organize, free in many respects; therefore, far more is expected of you. \"Your work should be more productive,\" thus call to you those from beyond the grave who fell gloriously for the cause of liberty; thus call to you the abundantly productive wheat fields of Ukrainia.",

At that hour Ukrainia will need more well-educated people for various official positions in different branches and departments of her future State apparatus. I am sorry to say that in the past some of our men holding responsible positions were not trained enough for their special offices, and this was one of the main reasons why Ukrainia was defeated. Due to this frequent incompetency of officeholders, the shrewd enemies had a freer hand to enter the forbidden door which, when they once entered they left but ruins therein. Thus the things that were valiantly fought for by our boys, everything worthwhile acquired by the Ukrainians, was destroyed by the enemy.",
                "Therefore, organize for the time of liberation is again very near. Have the rank and file of well-educated men and youth in various branches of learning prepared and ready to answer the call of Ukrainia to fill successfully her administrative offices. Therefore be ready! At the opportune time let every one be on the alert, prepared and ready to fall in line and take the place where he is best fitted. Be ready to drive away the enemy, the occupier of our native land, and stand firmly on guard to prevent any hostile creature from poisoning our future peaceful inhabitants.",

There, in the United States, you have the facilities to prepare those things, and this is all the more reason why you should not let any party differences cause any dissension among you.",

Today the latter are dying of cold and starvation. In Eastern Galicia and all over Ukraine we see utter poverty and starvation. In Eastern Galicia as well as all over Ukraine nothing but gloom, pauperism and starvation is to be found. Who is to help them? We! Other people will not take care of our nation.",
                "We Sitch members of Chicago and abroad, should take example from our forefathers Zaporoztsi. By this time we should have already 100,000 Sitch members right here in America, but alas, we are far below this desired number.",

Otherwise, we shall not be worthy of the name of followers of the famous Cossacks as long as we do not do our sacred duty to our brothers over there.",

It is our sacred duty to take our own native country out of the hands of the enemy and become ourselves masters in our homeland. To accomplish this we must solidly unite into one unbroken chain with one aim and slogan: Away with the enemy from our country. Let us get to work. Let us establish Sitch branches in every place where such as yet are not existing. By being united in Sitch organizations it will give us strength and prestige and help to drive away the enemy. This we have to bring to a successful end, and the sooner the better, because we do not intend to continue dying in agony under the Polish yoke.",

                "Day after day, year after year, our nation is fighting for freedom, and is waiting for the moment of resurrection, the moment of freedom!",
                "Many summers our forefathers, fathers and even our brothers toiled at the sweat of their brows, the hottest days not excluded, on the manor fields that were not, and are not their own; many winters they froze in unheated homes or tramped around without a place to lay their heads, they were all waiting and lived with the sole hope that better days were yet to come, the days of national freedom. They were and are still waiting! Their bodies are freezing with cold, while Polish bandits are beating them up, yet they suffer, and are waiting for us here beyond the seas, with their outstretched arms asking us for help!",

Is it with our tears, by weeping over their bitter fate, without otherwise even turning a finger for a betterment of their lot, while we continue to live comfortably here in America? We must help them with something substantial! We must follow the appeal which they send us through the words of President Petrushevich and his envoys! We, one and all, should buy a National Liberty Bond, and thus help to defend the rights of Eastern Galicia, i.e., Western Ukrainia. This is the only way in which we can help our fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, who are suffering today great tortures under Polish bayonets.",

                "Therefore, we appeal to you, all Siege members of both sexes: If there be anybody who still has not bought a Liberty Bond to help free Eastern Galicia from the Polish occupiers and their yoke, try to buy one for the smallest sum of money. It is the last call!",
                "Be generous, Siege members! Those few dollars that you have or will spend for the Liberty Bond, they will be paid back to you or to your children by Ukrainia, when she is freed.",
                "It is the duty of every Siege member to not only buy a bond, but also to help sell some to others.",
                "Christmas time is approaching. Try to recollect how you Siege members, enjoyed immensely this Christmas holiday in Ukrainia. How lovely it is just to think of it. How sweetly, how pleasantly, in a cozy home with the rest of the family we celebrated it. But how bitter it is for the one who does not have any home relatives, and sometimes not even a bite of stale bread on this great holiday. What an unwelcome thought to think of those unfortunate ones, hungry and in tatters, driven out of Ukrainia by the enemy, somewhere in Europe tramping through foreign lands, and reminding themselves on Christmas day of the grand times we all once had in Ukrainia.",
                "Such poor tramps, hungry and ill-dressed, are our own Siege sharpshooters in Czechoslovakia and other countries. These, our brothers, once sacrificed their lives for their people, they still are more ready to fight for the ideal of freedom for our land and people. They, hungry and cold, are just awaiting the momentum, when again they will have a chance to fight for what is Ukrainian. It is our duty to help them. Let us show them materially that we are united with them in spirit, and thereby we will inspire them while they are waiting for an opportune time to fight!",
                "Therefore, on Christmas Day let us go from house to house to sing Christmas carols and the money received for it let us send to our brother fighters. Let none of the Ukrainian homes refuse Christmas carolers, for theirs is a great purpose: to help our heroes who stand in protest against the whole world for the freedom of Ukrainia.",

Greetings: I have just received a copy of Sichovi Visty of August last, wherein I notice that during the meeting of June 27, the Sitch members of Chicago praised me and my work very highly by standing up and singing the song, \"What Kind of Wind\", in my honor. Many thanks to P. Novodvorsky, Chicago district colonel, and Stephen Musiychuk, district secretary, for their initiative in the matter.",
                "Unfortunately this news did not reach me until half a year later, but it has moved me greatly. I have worked for our cause all my life, and especially during the World War, yet how much have I suffered even from my own countryman? Therefore, this kind of acknowledgment on the part of my Chicago oversea brothers, is real manna for my greatly depressed soul.",
                "On this account, I am, my dear brothers, herewith expressing my cordial thanks for your appreciation of my work. At this moment I wish to add that it makes me very happy to see you, beyond all expectations, as stalwart Sitch members as you were in your native land. I know you are furthering the Sitch activity in the same direction and spirit as it once flourished in the Eastern Ukraine.",
                "I am building high hopes on your excellent Sitch organization, for I am sure that it will be a blessing to America, and that it will have a considerable bearing upon our national regeneration in the homeland.",
                "True enough, our land, at the present time, is flooded with enemy regiments, and our people are groaning under the feet of the Poles; therefore, all the greater responsibility lies upon us as emigrants. We must do what our brothers and sisters in the native land cannot. It is our duty to give them both material and moral help, so that all may survive this critical period.",
                "It is the duty of all of us who are now living abroad to prepare all those things which are necessary for our Sitch activity, so that, should we return home, we will be prepared and supplied with ammunition.",
                "Toward the end of February, 1919, I established a main Sitch Committee in Vinnitsa, in Great Ukraine, and at the end of April a similar committee in the Carpathian Ukraine (formerly under Hungary).",
                "There is an excellent opportunity for you, Ukrainian-Chicagoans, in the coming year, 1921, to make yourselves known to the entire civilized world. Next year, a great convention of athletic societies and associations of the laboring class will take place in Prague. It is the so-called \"Athletic Olympiad,\" a festival to which all the working-class athletic organizations of the whole world are invited. This Olympiad will be under the auspices of the United Workingmen's Gymnastic League, Prague, II, Navlickova, 5 B, whose honorary head is Masaryk himself, president of the Czechoslovak Republic. The Czechoslovak government, through Mr. Benes, its minister of foreign affairs, has officially invited the whole world to take part in this festival.",
                "As a sacred duty you should do everything in your power to see that your Sitch organization in Chicago, as well as all the other Sitch organizations in other countries all over the world, is well represented at this festival, since it is classed also as a workingmen's athletic organization. You, Ukrainian-Chicagoans, should help, by your active participation in this festival, to let the whole world hear about you and thus be reminded that the Ukrainian nation lives, and together with working-men's athletic organizations of other nationalities fights for the betterment of humanity.",
                "It is evident that our Ukrainian brigades in Czechoslovakia will not lag behind. We are sure that they, especially those from the Carpathian Ukraine (autonomous state in Czechoslovakia), will be very well represented on this occasion.",
                "You also, Ukrainian-Chicagoans, must help us to show the world that Ukrainia lives and is struggling in every field for her existence and betterment. Therefore, it is desirable that your Chicago Sitch, as well as the American Sitch in general, take part in this athletic festival. It is self-evident that you are unable to send out a large group, but you can send a small detachment, including especially those members who have had something to do with Europe in the past. The Ukrainian flag carried beside the splendid American starry flag at the festival, will help us to gain friends among the Czechs as well as among other nations, and particularly among the American-born delegates, some of whom do not as yet know much about us Ukrainians, and about our Sitch organization in America.",
                "Thanking you, Ukrainian-Chicagoans, members of the Sitch organization, from the bottom of my heart for your friendly acknowledgment of my work, may I take this opportunity to command the attention of the whole worthy Sitch organization in the United States of America, and cry out with a thundering voice so that my brothers and sisters beyond the sea may hear the words:",

                "The greeting of the dear guests took place in the national hall at Oakley Blvd. and Rice St., during the extraordinary meeting of the Ukrainian delegates of all the Ukrainian societies in Chicago and vicinity, witnessed by an audience of several hundred people.",
                "Dr. Vladimir Siminovich was chairman of the meeting; M. Ftomin and H. Kisil were secretaries.",
                "At 2 P. M. Dr. Julian Bachynsky and his secretary, Mr. Kozakivich, appeared at the meeting, being welcomed by a thundering ovation of those present.",
                "In the name of the meeting and the whole Ukrainian colony in the city of Chicago and vicinity, Dr. Siminovich cordially greeted the legation of the Ukrainian Republic. To this Dr. Bachynsky answered with a speech to the meeting that was actually flowing from the heart.",
                "Having explained to the meeting that the main object of the arrival of Ukrainian diplomatic mission to America was to gain recognition of the Ukrainian Independent Republic by the United States Government, Dr. Bachynsky pointed out the manner and the way whereby the Ukrainian immigration in the United States has the possibility and the duty to help the Ukrainian state mission to attain their main object.",
                "\"The Ukrainian immigration in America,\" said Dr. Bachynsky, \"is almost in its entirety of a working class character, which is a deciding factor in its organizations, struggling for a decent living wages. This characteristic of our immigrants in America, once farmers and laborers in the old country, who are earning their daily bread with their hands, is the reason why the Ukrainian immigration on this side of the ocean with such enthusiasm greeted the Ukrainian National Republic in the Ukrainian native land; an independent state of the Ukrainian farmers and laborers in particular.",
                "\"This almost uniform characteristic of the Ukrainian immigration in America shows that all its groups are in their very essence alike, not antagonistic, and as such should go in one direction, especially in the affairs wherein the welfare and the future of the Ukrainian nation, of the Ukrainian democratic state and its independence is concerned. The leaders of the several independent groups ought to bear this well in mind.",
                "\"The Ukrainian State mission,\" continued Dr. Bachynsky, \"does not meddle nor does it intend to interfere with the interior affairs of each group among the Ukrainian immigration.",
                "\"The mission treats all the groups alike as individuals working for the general welfare of the Ukrainian cause, and suggests only, and wishes from its very heart that the scale of activity of every group be raised to the utmost of its capacity in order to help the native nation and land to realize its wishes, sincerity and zeal, with which the Ukrainian immigrant is enthused for the common cause of ours.",
                "\"As in Ukrainia, all the loyal sons of hers, regardless of their political tendency, joined one common front to defend and safeguard the liberty and freedom of Ukrainia, so also it is the duty of the Ukrainian immigration on this side of the ocean, unanimously to stand together and with its power second the motion and thus support our brothers in the native land.",
                "\"Contention and ambition of the individual groups can find its expression only in the field of zealous activity for the good of the nation.\"",
                "Further, the speaker suggested the ways by which the beyond-the-sea immigration can assist Ukrainia.",
                "In the first place this is a matter of a political activity and propaganda of the Ukrainian immigrants in favor of the independence of the Ukrainian National Republic.",
                "Starting with shops and factories where the Ukrainian workingman meets the Americans, and going up to the highest legislative and executive bodies of the American Federal institutions, the Ukrainian immigrants have the opportunity of carrying on a propaganda in favor of our most justified Ukrainian cause.",
                "The American citizens, the American public opinion, the decisive American legislative, and other official bodies must be informed in every possible way by the Ukrainian immigration in America about the just struggle of the Ukrainian nation for its freedom and state independence, and thus help the free and independent Ukrainia to earn the approval and acknowledgment of the greatest republic in the world, the United States of America.",
                "Every judicious activity on the part of the Ukrainian immigration aimed in that direction will aid our endeavor considerably.",
                "This work of the Ukrainian immigration in America, in many instances, already has taken up in that direction an organized form of activity with the assistance of the Ukrainian press and the information bureaus.",
                "It is understood, however, that the activity of the official Ukrainian mission in the United States has entirely to travel by independent roads.",
                "The second great duty of our beyond-the-sea immigration is to help materially the pillaged and destroyed native country during the World War, and especially that part of the country which suffered the most, namely, Eastern Galicia.",
                "In this field this immigration can and ought to help very much the native country.",
                "Contributions and the sending out to the old country of suits of clothes, linen, shoes, and other materials, and funds by the Ukrainian immigrants in America will alleviate the horrible misery among the relatives in our native country.",
                "The whole Ukrainian (Eastern) Galicia groans not only from starvation and cold, but also from the dreadful epidemic diseases.",
                "For the money collected in America it will be possible to organize medical help and hospital assistance; to buy medicine for the sick and bread for the hungry.",
                "A material help on the part of the beyond-the-sea emigration to the native land is at the present time of the most vital importance.",
                "Therefore, with greatest joy the speaker did welcome the thought of establishing a Ukrainian Relief Committee among the immigrants of ours to help the native land. This had been proposed already and unanimously decided upon by the delegates of all the Ukrainian organizations in America that met in New York to make this a reality as soon as possible.",
                "The aim of the activity of the Ukrainian Relief Committee is of an immense importance and of common interest to all the Ukrainian immigrants. Therefore, the proposed work of the Committee ought to reconcile to themselves the Ukrainian totality both in the United States and Canada. Only with united energy and effort of all the United States citizens of Ukrainian descent, who are the only source of help for our suffering brothers, the old country can receive such material help as is necessary at the present extraordinary critical moment to eliminate the heretofore unheard of suffering as much as possible.",
                "The third point of Dr. Bachysky's speech was about preparing the emigrants to serve the native country as useful Ukrainian citizens in the event they go back there.",
                "Many emigrants in America and Canada with time will return to the native land. Ukrainia entertains high hopes of her sons living abroad. Ukrainia will welcome them with sincere, open arms as experienced and well prepared builders of the new Ukrainian Republic and of the independent Ukranian national life.",
                "The sons of Ukrainia, who because of the long period of war, though many of them wounded, in great sufferings and scarcity, lifted up the risen Ukrainia and defended her freedom and independence, but they are too much exhausted to undertake the creative and reconstructive work by themselves. They need our help, our fresh unused energy. This supply of new energy will come from our beyond-the-sea emigration.",
                "For the Ukrainian emigrants abroad, in the first place the youth, awaits a great task in the independent Ukrainia. They are to continue the life in freedom through channels of creative work.",
                "Therefore, the Ukrainian youth abroad, of both sexes, ought to prepare itself here accordingly for that one great task.",
                "Should they return to Ukrainia, they ought to be armed with sincerity, enlightenment, and stand as fearless defenders of the Ukrainian liberty.",
                "They ought to return with the greatest possible resources of human skill and professional knowledge.",
                "Thus, in the old country, they will become leaders and teachers of their brothers, who lived all their lives in their native land, in those things which they had a chance to learn in the wide world.",
                "Therefore, an organization of the Ukrainian youth among the beyond-the-sea emigration, whose concrete object is love of and attachment to the independent Ukrainia, to work for intellectual uplifting and professional learning of the members, is exactly the best sign that the Ukrainian immigrants of the United States and Canada understand well their future duty toward their own nation and their native land.",
                "The speaker sincerely welcomes the Siege brotherhood in the United States who inscribed on its banner an uplifting, yet true, slogan \"in union and learning lies the strength of the nation.\"",
                "Under this slogan the sons of Ukrainia are shedding their blood for the freedom of Ukrainia. Under this slogan the Siege brothers from beyond-the-sea in an opportune time, will stand shoulder to shoulder to active work for common good.",
                "A storm of a long-lasting ovation was the reward of the envoy, Julian Bachynsky, for his speech.",
                "With the speech of Dr. Bachynsky ended the official appearance of the Ukrainian mission before the Ukrainian colony of Chicago.",
                "Then followed a discussion of the delegates of the associations in the presence of the envoys of the mission.",
                "The following took part in the discussions: H. Kysil, Novodvorsky, Dr. Siminovich, Moranets, Kryvovyaz, Rev. N. Strutynsky, Didyk, Boychuk, Dr. Hrynevetsky.",
                "The discussion was carried mainly on the ways of organizing a speedy material help to the native country.",
                "As a consequence the meeting unanimously passed a resolution demanding of all the central organizations, whose delegates took part in the common conference in New York, under the leadership of the head of the Ukrainian diplomatic mission, to introduce and establish as soon as possible a Relief Committee for the purpose of helping the native country on the basis that had been decided upon by the delegates of the Ukrainian organizations at the New York conference.",
                "It was delegated also to the Ukrainian Red Cross in Chicago, as a local branch of the future Relief Committee, to start out its activity in Chicago and vicinity as soon as possible.",
                "The treasurer of the Chicago Committee is Dr. Siminovich who, simultaneously with the activity in Chicago and vicinity, undertook to organize another Relief Committee in Canada, where he is invited by the Canadian Ukrainian organizations and will leave for Canada in the nearest future.",
                "Immediately after the meeting they started the relief collection, which will be carried out systematically within all the societies, and at every opportune time till the end of the relief collection campaign.",
                "Dr. Bachynsky, the envoy, made a good start by contributing $100 to the relief fund.",
                "The collection among the Oakley group was postponed till the next Sunday, due to the fact that the meeting was coming to a close.",
                "To begin with $340.30 was collected on the very first day.",
                "Dr. V. Siminovich, in the name of all the Ukrainians present, thanked the envoys of the Ukrainian mission for their coming to Chicago. The meeting ended with the national anthem, \"Already Ukrainia has risen.\""

                "The Chicago Polish newspaper, National Daily, organ of the Polish banker Smulski, who is a personal friend of Paderewski, usually has very good information about all affairs concerning Poland, and about all the Polish propaganda and its official politics both in Europe and America.",
                "In the issue No. 266 of the above mentioned newspaper, of Nov. 12th, the editorial, \"It, and let it be so,\" there are important data which throw light on the character of the Polish official circles headed by Paderewski and the delegates for the Peace Conference in Paris, and particularly on the character of Polk, the United States delegate with reference to the Ukrainian (Eastern) Galicia.",
                "The Poles make great endeavors to make the Peace Conference in Paris, which has almost decided as to its taking the final step, to cede definitely Ukrainian Galicia to the Polish state forever.",
                "The Poles, who in a criminal way, aggressively with the force of arms, against the will of all the Ukrainian nation, occupied Ukrainian Galicia, are very much concerned and want to induce the Peace Conference in Paris to give them some title, whereby they could hold the Ukrainian land in the rapacious claws of the Polish white eagle.",
                "Mr. Polk, a delegate to the Peace Conference in Paris, a representative from this great American nation, waged war against the European autocracy to insure all the enslaved nations who are deprived of freedom and independence to give them justice; according to the Polish newspaper, he acted very favorably toward Poles in their robbing aggresiveness with reference to foreign lands, and in the first place toward Ukrainian (Eastern) Galicia.",
                "Here is what the National Daily writes: \"With reference to Eastern Galicia Mr. Korab Kucharski in his last letter from Paris writes favorable news.",
                "\"Our general opinion is that the Polish affairs have been pushed aside from the green table and our delegation, having folded their arms indifferently, follows a development of affairs foreign to us. However, to judge it to be so would be a mistake. President Paderewski told me: 'During the last three weeks I signed more notes and made more declarations than before during the congress session.'",
                "\"As a matter of fact, within the last few days our delegation waged one of the most important, if not the heaviest fights at the congress. It was about ceding Lemberg and Eastern Galicia to Poland. This affair had been decided and buried in the mass of documents and memorials.",
                "\"The highest tribunal had decreed that Eastern Galicia will be ceded to Poland for a stretch of fifteen years, and after that a plebiscite will take place as to where it is to belong.",
                "To lose Eastern Galicia would mean not only to lose the oil fields and the fertile land, but would mean also tearing down one of the main pillars of the Polish state.",
                "\"This view was directed by the activity of our delegates, Paderewski and Dmowski.",
                "\"Therefore, our representatives when they learned about the decision of the Peace Conference with reference to Eastern Galicia, they did not take it for granted.",
                "\"Paderewski succeeded, due to selected arguments and ceaseless activity for several weeks, in the first attempt to convince the congress.",
                "\"The matter is altogether exceptional and extraordinary. The business about Eastern Galicia, although already decided a few days previously, was brought back before the highest tribunal.",
                "\"Our representatives succeeded in breaking through the congress routine due to the American plenipotential delegate, Mr. Polk, who was so taken up with the arguments presented to him by them in their private conversation, that he interrupted the discussion which was in progress before the highest tribunal and brought up the question about Eastern Galicia.",
                "\"The French, Italian, and English delegates, on hearing this declaration unanimously decided that Eastern Galicia should be ceded to Poland without any further plebiscite. From now on we can consider that our endeavors are won already.\"",
                "Such information is given to the Americans through the Polish-American newspaper by the correspondent Korab-Kucharski, who is one of the noted Polish politicians in Paris. In the presence of the American Poles he handed in to Minister Polk a flattering acknowledgment of his zeal in favor of Poland.",
                "The American Poles ought to be thankful to Minister Polk for what he has done for Poland.",
                "Yet, for the Americans and the Ukrainians who stand for truth and justice, the ardent undertaking by the American delegate, Mr. Polk, of the business about Eastern Galicia which was ratified later by the Paris conference (before Mr. Polk was there), was again sent back before the highest tribunal with this aim, that it be done in favor of the Poles, only because Mr. Polk was taken up in private conversation with the Polish representatives, appears to us at least queer, if nothing else."

A tramp alone is expected not to make anything out of it; his heart will surely not be bleeding over the downfall of the general all-Ukrainian affairs of the Ukrainians in America. Why is it so? Because a tramp is loafing, walking aimlessly from place to place, and therefore does not look deep into the hearts of the Ukrainian \"politicians\" who are tools in the hands of our \"leaders.\"",
                "At one time there appeared all sorts of articles published that called upon the nation to unity. Now one, now another political party wanted us to join their ranks. Each one of them promised everything possible to help us to attain the independence of Ukrainia; to give help to our poor enslaved brothers and sisters in the old country. The slogans of one or the other party did not fall like the grain on the stone, but fell on sensitive hearts, and everyone tried to contribute as much as he possibly could.",
                "But there was nothing wrong in it. Soon the offerings were directed to purposes to which the people assigned. I shall not enlarge on that whether or not the offerings went to their destined place. I have in mind to divulge the consequences which are being felt due to not sufficiently enlightened and rather blind partisans.",
                "A good number of people, to whom the good of the Mother Ukrainia is not only at heart, but they almost can not imagine Ukrainia as an enslaved state, so they group themselves, hold meetings, and think time and again and plan on what would be the most expedient way to group together all the Ukrainians under one banner, under one slogan: \"Help the native country.\" After having made definite plans, they call together a larger number of people, they reveal their thoughts, and all of them like one agree on the proposition.",
                "To this group comes and joins another group, etc., until all of them are of the same mind. However, it would be better by far, if the partisan misunderstanding would be entirely and once for all discarded and all of them took to work for common good, and no Ukrainian should decline to act in that direction, especially to give moral and a material assistance to the native country.",
                "The heart leaped for joy in every Ukrainian, when he saw how all of them together, regardless of religious or political persuasion, attended meetings and gatherings, took part in discussions and exchanged their ideas and experiences: they united themselves in order to expand the work of good will. It seemed that from now on there peace will be established among us against which no hostile force shall prevail. And indeed no hostile force could shatter us in performing our determined work. This incident will be present in our mind till our very death, and we shall glibly entertain thoughts about it and hand them over to our children, as if it were a miracle, that all the Ukrainians in Chicago and in the United States, full-heartedly tended toward the one aim.",
                "Yet, how long did it last? After several months a few political bigots, who could not see further than their party, started their irrational movement. Seeing that the people were gladly contributing, and that the sum was swelling considerably, they wanted to distribute that money, not among their enslaved brothers and sisters who beg for help, but to send it over to their party, so that the party would promulgate the names of the bigots in heavy type - for they want to be shown how big they are - and could show to the public that they are the holders of the receipt from the money. And as to their brothers and sisters living in the old country - what of it - let them die of cold and starvation, let them cry for help as much as they want to, they (the bigots) do not hear the cry from across the ocean.",
                "Do not worry, however, dear brothers and sisters! Not all the people of ours are of this type! Before long those ambitious criers will stop their bigotry; their foggy heads will clear out and they will come back to themselves and see their grave mistake. Deep within their hearts they are as generous and as good as the rest of the Ukrainians, and therefore they will soon understand that we could rather stand the decline of our institutions in the United States than the downfall of our Motherland.",
                "When our Mother Ukrainia becomes a free and independent state, she will not forget us in our needs, provided we help her now, provided we support her now. She does not need our pecuniary help for political purposes, either at home or abroad but she needs and expects of us her sons and daughters a moral and material support for reconstructing purposes.",
                "The finest moral support we can offer to our Mother Ukrainia is when we all group ourselves together, and leave out once for all all sorts of misunderstandings, negative criticisms, and dissensions, and stand shoulder to shoulder to fight the enemy. Thereby we shall give a living example to our brothers and sisters in the old country and thus show them what they have to do to win liberty, freedom and independence for Ukrainia.",
                "We shall help Mother Ukrainia then, when we hurry to dispatch not only money, but also clothes and food. Therewith we shall strengthen their spirits, which are weakened in them through sufferings of cold and starvation.",
                "Let us leave the political field to diplomatic missions who are existing in all countries. Let us help them by sending our protests and urgent requests to state officials; everywhere let us arrange local protesting manifestations, protesting meetings, and let us promulgate this among the Americans and other nations.",
                "We think that our diplomatic mission does not need any money from us, but in case they would require of us what Ukrainian would there be but would contribute for the purpose.",
                "In unity there is strength. Therefore, let us do everything with a united front; let us not permit any dissension to creep in; let us not look around asking what does the majority want or what the minority does not want, but let us act in such a way that all unanimously would agree upon our propositions. And when we act thus, do not worry, Ukrainia! No hostile power in this world can sweep thee away; no enemy shall prevail thee, and the Ukrainian nation is assured of coming up to the very top in Europe.",

To counteract the evil, we wish to explain to our people at this meeting what danger each one of them runs into.",
                "At that meeting of October 12, 1919, there were about 250 present, including men and women. It was opened by Mr. P. Kavatsiw. In a few words he explained to those that were gathered the purpose of the meeting, and asked them to nominate a candidate for chairman of the meeting.",

Yet, we, instead of helping them in their honest efforts, go to any Polack, our cursed enemy to take advice from him on how to counteract their destructive activity. Now reason this out with me: \"Could there be any greater crime a Ukrainian could commit than to go to the Polish consul, take out a passport there, and swear that he is ready every minute to join their legion, and thus go and murder the enemies of mother Poland? Murder his brothers and sisters, nay, even his very father and mother, should they still be living in the wilderness without a place to lay their heads.",

Have you enough conscience to give away your money, earned with the sweat of your brow, to the Pole, and thus provide for him the means to procure a stronger knout with which he will drive your father and mother deeper into the cave, whence they shall never be able to see God's world, and themselves occupy their cozy homes, making themselves comfortable in their feather-quill beds?",
                "You send clothing and footwear through the Polish agents who, instead of sending them to your wife, children or parents, are distributing them among those Polish bums who stand with knouts at the entrance of the caves in which your most beloved dwell, lest perchance they may show their heads out of the cave, their unavoidable grave, and thus in the meantime other nations may notice the horrible Polish culture.\"",

After hearing the speeches of Mrs. Mary Bilyk, Harry Kryvovyaz, and Yaroslaw Skrotsky, they understood better the object of the Ukrainian Red Cross, and without any encouragement on the part of the speakers, they contributed $22.55, which makes with the former collection $108.85.",

Our enemies tried to show our fight for liberation of Ukrainia as Bolshevistic. When we are all united then the horrible falsehoods of the enemies will come to light. It will prove that only a few dozen of Ukrainian people are Bolsheviks, are half-wits and are not fit to think for themselves. The Jewish and the Russian comrades think for them and the red guardians only parrot the phases which they learned from them."

                "The first issue of Ukrainia is dedicated to the Honorable Dr. Vladimir Siemenovich. Could it be otherwise?",
                "The history of the Ukrainian colony in our city, is so tightly and so finely bound with the life of Dr. Vladimir Siemenovich, and his sympathetic and eminent person is so well known to all Chicagoans, that if, by some accident, he should be absent from any of our general national holidays, or if he were not seen at some important community affair then we should look around and expectantly ask: \"Why is not Dr. V. Siemenovich here? Perhaps the poor man is sick, or maybe he is only detained and will yet come....\" There was a time when the Honorable Dr. wax never late, but always put himself at the head of every national work, and always he was the last to leave it, even when his home and professional obligations were heavy. So when he is recently sometimes late this, folks, you will please pardon him.....today.",
                "When Chicago and all the cultured world, will celebrate the World's Fair in our city (1933) we, the Chicago Ukrainian group, and it may be the entire Ukrainian people, on this continent as well as in Europe, will celebrate the forty year jubilee of the permanent, effective and uninterrupted work of the Hon. Dr. Vladimir Siemenovich in our city. This will be our Ukrainian holiday, and we do not doubt that it will turn out on a grand scale.",
                "Dr. Vladimir Siemenovich was born in Galicia, from an old priestly family, which gave out a great number of both secular and clerical marvels, very well known in the history of the Lithuanian-Ukrainian state, hundreds of years before our time. After completing his gymnasium studies and several years of law in the University of Lviv, young Vladimir bade farewell to his native country and started over the ocean. The heavy yoke over Galicia, ruled by the Austrian-Polish nobility, which he felt more than the average man, caused the young Ukrainian law student to stand on American soil on March 11, 1887. The Galician-Ukrainian Bibliography published by the late John Levitsky in the very same year received its first batch of American news from Dr. V. Siemenovich, for the Lviv Dilo; from then even until this day the Venerable Doctor has not let the pen out of his very busy hand, since month after month, year after year, persistently does he help the Ukrainian publications both in his native land and here, without any pretension and always with excellent articles on various subjects.",
                "At the time of his stay in the East our young immigrant took an active part in the national work, besides attending a University where he finished the course of medicine. In 1893, as a young Doctor, he undertook a permanent stay in Chicago and since then has never abandoned us.",
                "Little and hardly evident was the Ukrainian colony in Chicago, not quite forty years ago. Many of us were not yet then living....As a young doctor, he won the love and admiration of his people. From this time on there was not one national event, not one useful community work in which Dr. V. Siemenovich did not take active part. Along with this the modest but hospitable home of Madam and Dr. Siemenovich, both guardian angels, wise and active hosts and leaders, became a place of shelter, of moral consolation and of material help for everybody. It is no wonder then, that all who in anyway possible profited by the good hearted and generous hand of Dr. V. Siemenovich, are legion. It is pitiful that there were found among them some that paid him for their bread and lodging with great ingratitude, and that some boldly threw mud and rocks at their benefactor. Yet this never lessened the charitable optimism of the honorable doctor, and never has it ousted from his Christian heart this great guiding watchword of his life. The purpose of a noble soul is to work restlessly and create noble deeds for the good of humanity without looking for acknowledgement and thankfulness, without regard for the aggression and abuse of cunning and mean people, whose base profession is like the dog's barking, so that noble souls may keep up their endless work for the benefit of everybody - until death!",
                "In the above mentioned motto in the life of Dr. V. Siemenovich, there appears before our eyes all the beauty and splendor of a human being. It is evident that there are all kinds of people. Our late, prematurely dead poet, Alexander Kozlovsky, used to say occasionally without any sarcasm during Ukrainian meetings, \"Do I not see enough Ukrainian-Ruthenians? Only I do not see real men among them\".",
                "So our venerable Dr. Vladimir was a real man, both when with contempt he ran away from the hard bondage of the Austrian-Polish nobility, and when in America he became a doctor. He was a real man, a human being who at every opportunity knew well how to see the good in everyone else. That is what ancient Romans called the \"Salus Rei Publicae\", and it is exactly applicable to our honorable Dr. Vladimir through all his life, and the characteristic will remain with him until his end comes. Thus we all must perceive, love and honor the beauty and splendor of his noble soul.",
                "Cultured Americans and, generally, all the cultured Anglo-Saxons, the Germans and the French have learned during long ages to respect and to esteem the human soul and man's brains above all the treasures of the world. \"You may destroy all our machines and all our factories\" - the Americans say - \"yet we shall not bewail for our educational geniuses will build them again even more perfectly. But if our scholars were annihilated then our great nation would be immediately reduced to powder; for it is impossible to make up for the loss of genial human brains even with mountains of educational human trash.\"",
                "We, too, do respect and esteem the ideal and the genius of Ukrainian magnanimity in the honorable person of our most beloved and eminent Doctor Siemenovich, as well as his Ukrainian kindness, benevolence, hospitality, personal modesty, self-sacrifice, public munificence, ceaseless labor and his ready understanding of human weakness.",
                "We bow our head before him to the very ground as before a Socrates, a promoter of learning and science, but, above all, do we salute Dr. Vladimir Siemenovich as an ideal man, Ecce Homo! - Behold the man!",
                "Dear Ukrainian youth, and all you Ukrainians who are dispersed all over God's creation like so many autumnal leaves! Behold an example for all and everyone of us - for all the young and the old, for the learned and those untutored, for the rich and the poor - a rare pattern indeed - uncommon, pure as a crystal, an exemplary type of an ideal human being to be fully initiated!",
                "Behold him as one that always has been, is now and shall remain forever in his wholesome seed that he so prolifically sowed into his uncultivated national soil; behold him as the invigorating salt of the earth; behold him as the shining luminary dispersing the darkness; here is a man who throughout his life has sacrificed his ego on the altar of his Ukrainian people and Fatherland.",

                "Dr. Vladimir Sieminovich was born on January 4, 1862 in Monastersky (county of Buczacz [in the Ukraine]), the son of a priest. His father's name was Leo, and the maiden name of his mother, Domicelia, was Turkevich. The mother of Dr. Sieminovich is still living; she is ninety-five years of age. Dr. Sieminovich received his early schooling in Buczacz, Berezan, Stanislawow and Lwow. University studies included at first law (two years) at Lwow, and later medicine at the John Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland; and after that, one year of medicine at Prague, a year at Vienna, a course at Cracow, one at Berlin, and one in Paris at the Sorbonne. These are the best universities of the world.",
                "Dr. Sieminovich has lived in America for the past thirty-nine years. At first, he lived in Shenandoah, Pennsylvania, where he edited the first Ukrainian newspaper in America, the weekly America. He worked there one year and a half. Then he went to Europe as delegate to Cardinal S. Sembratovich in Lwow, to obtain Ukrainian priests for the Ukrainians of America. He brought back Father Andruchovich. Dr. Sieminovich organized, or helped to organize, many Ukrainian churches in the United States. The first parish in Chicago was organized in a hall above a saloon at Robey and Homer Streets, twenty years ago. Dr. Sieminovich has worked in Chicago for the last thirty-two years. When he first came, there were no Ukrainians here from Galicia, except for a few Lemkos and Carpathian Ukrainians. The first mass in Chicago was celebrated by the Rev. Father G. Tsmaylo Kulchytsky in the hall under the St. Stanislaus Kostka Church, at Noble and Blanche Streets. Dr. Sieminovich took active part in the organizing of the oldest Ukrainian society in Chicago, the Society of George Solomeychuk (later changed to Society of St. Nicholas). This is Branch 106 of the Ukrainian National Association.",
                "The first Ukrainian church in Chicago was situated at Bickerdike and Superior Streets, and was purchased from the Swedes for $5,750. Dr. Sieminovich, along with the late Attorney Yanovich, signed notes for this amount. The above-mentioned amount also included the purchase of a parish house. The same group sold all this property and bought a large tract at Oakley and Rice Streets for the sum of $16,000. This tract included sixteen lots at one thousand dollars per lot, and is the site where the large Ukrainian Church now stands. Before the parish took possession of the property, quarrels began because part of the people wanted the Orthodox Church. Dr. Sieminovich stood for the Catholic Church, whereupon, upon his recommendation, the bank loaned the money without the signature of Mr. Fetzura, who was unwilling to sign because he wanted the Orthodox Church. Dr. Sieminovich vouched for the loan with his own securities and the bank issued the money.",
                "The first newspaper in Chicago was Ukraina which lasted for a few years. It began during the war. In the first issue of Ukraina, Dr. Sieminovich published the following proclamation: Organize a Ukrainian legion here under the guidance of Roosevelt. The first to oppose this were the socialists from the \"Federation\", even though Dr. Sieminovich was their head. Mr. Semeshko, especially, voiced his opinion against the creation of the legion; he is now some commissar in Russia. He came here from Siberia.",
                "Besides the Ukraina, the Ranna Zorya (Morning Star) appeared for about a year. It was the organ of the Ukrainian Women's Alliance, which was organized on the same principles as the Ukrainian National Association. The administration was carried out wonderfully by a woman who came from Lwow, and who was the wife f a Croatian, Mr. Zubsich. This paper collapsed because of local misunderstandings. Dr. Sieminovich was also the editor of this paper. Dr. Sieminovich was co-editor for many Ukrainian newspapers in the old country, such as Dilo (Action) and Ukrainske Slove (The Ukrainian Voice). In America, he wrote for the Svoboda (Liberty), America, and the Narodna Vola (National Will). Twice he visited the Ukrainian colonies in Canada, where he organized the Ukrainian Red Cross.",
                "Dr. Sieminovich has a great knowledge of life. One of the basic features of his character is the value which he attributes to women. He says that women are as important to any cause as the soil is to the feeding of people. When we turn due attention on our women, we will find that the idea of our freedom was originated by them generations ago.",
                "Therefore, we turn our Sitch organ over to the guidance of the worker mentioned above. The Chief Ataman [Hetman] and the Sitch Central Committee could not have made a better selection; they sent to Dr. Sieminovich the deputation to which he pledged his best efforts. He will certainly exert all of his imposing energy and all his knowledge of life, for he has seen many things on this earth and has been through a great deal."

There he received his first inspiration, and determined to give himself to the study of music.",

Soon he joined the Chicago Ukrainian, under the name of Taras Shevchenko Band, and later on he played a trombone in the Chicago City Band. On the side, however, it was his ambition to reorganize and better the Ukrainian band. This he succeeded in doing, and made great progress with it.",

After finishing this he became a conductor of a military band and had thirty-five musicians to supervise. In a short time he made such a good showing with the band that he recieved high official praise, which was published in the Chicago Daily Tribune, and he became a candidate for first lieutenant at the time the Armistice was signed.",

As conductor there he made wonderful progress. Besides all this work, he did everything possible to change Ukrainian amateurs into real musicians.",
                "One of his best qualities was that when he was appointed conductor of the army band, he attracted the attention of not only American admirers of music but also Ukrainians, and other nationalities, who all wondered at the skill and deftness of the talented young conductor. Everywhere in the city among musicians as well as lovers of music, one could hear admirers of John Barabash predict a great career for him.",

                "On October 4, at 7 A.M., this unmerciful angel of death came unexpectedly to the home of our beloved Father Osyp Kuzma and took his immaculate soul to eternity, leaving a remembrance after his frightful visit: to his dearest wife, to all his co-nationalists, friends and acquaintances, to members of the Ukrainian National Church of the Blessed Trinity on Erie near Robey Street, to friends by calling, the Ukrainian National priests and to all the Ukrainian National Churches of America, as well as to our dear Ukrainia of which the deceased was a true son and an honorable and a loyal worker.",
                "The late Father Osyp was born on the 16th of November, 1889, in Zolochiv, Ukrainian Galicia, under an old black peasant roof.",
                "The parents of the deceased were Daniel and Catherine, who though being poor, decided to give everything they had in order that their son Osyp might receive a higher education. So, on completing the fourth grade in the national school, his parents sent Osyp to a gymnasium school, where the deceased was an outstanding student almost every year. It was thus until he reached seventh grade. Being a student in the seventh grade, the late Father Osyp very well understood the maltreatment of the Ukrainian people by the Poles, which he witnessed with his own eyes and then he began to help them morally. On every occasion he went to the neighboring villages, to the libraries, where he gave lectures, encouraging the youth to work among themselves. At times the late Father Osyp traveled with Ukrainin lectures, mostly before elections, and agitated in favor of the Ukrainian candidates for the senate. To add to the misfortune, evil was threatening. Surprising news began to seep through the school officials against Father Osyp; accusing him of being a \"haydamak,\" (robber). Following this news began the investigations of the Polish professors and even of our own; and hence a command to cease his activity. Having an inborn love for liberty and truth, the future Father Osyp, with his parents' consent, gave up his gymnasium studies, and bade farewell to his native home and his dearest countrymen, departing for the world beyond the wide sea, America, where he knew, was liberty, in which the deceased expected to find internal contentment.",
                "A poor man is always poor, says our watchword. This proverb particularly concerned the late Father Osyp. On coming to America, Father Osyp found himself abandoned, like a boat on the wild sea. No family nor friends nor acquaintances. In time he became acquainted with some of our intelligent people. Mostly the priests turned from the deceased without much faith, saying that he was an exile, loving none not even himself.",
                "So \"keep away from him, people!\"",
                "He was refused by his own.",
                "Yet other people who recognized the usefulness of Father Osyp interested themselves in him and tried to give him some work wherever possible.",
                "After learning the English language a little, the late Father Osyp enrolled in a business college at Wilkes Barre, Pa., striving one way or another to add to his knowledge, thus making his meager livelihood.",
                "In 1915 Father Osyp came to Milwaukee, Wis., where he got a job in a store. In the evenings he began to attend Marquette University.",
                "Through the good will of influential persons, the late Father Osyp began teaching in the Hanover Street public school and, besides this, he taught in the preparatory class for the citizens' papers. The deceased worked hard, without complaining against the bitter lot, being modest in self praise of his work.",
                "He only desired that his work should benefit others and only others, and that at the same time it should bring to him some livelihood. But he is a Ukrainian, he must work for the Ukrainian people, for the honest community.",
                "With fire in his soul he devoted himself to studying the occupations and positions of our people in America in every walk of life. Their Father Osyp studied the situation of the Ukrainians in America, and noticed a new trend, this being the movement for the national church.",
                "When he became a priest, Father Osyp (Joseph) was the happiest person in the world. \"I could draw the whole world to my heart now, together with my friends and enemies,\" he said after he was ordained. \"Granted health and strength, I believe that I will be able to do most everything for my dear Ukrainia and her children. I do not fear the enemies. They are not frightful to me, because I believe in the victory of light over darkness. I believe in triumph of the blessed truth over the cursed lie. I believe in the resurrection of the Ukrainian people from their dark tomb, into which the enemies gradually pushed our people, i. e., into spiritual darkness, ignorance and the national unconsciousness sown among them for centuries, which helped and even today helps to torture our dear Ukrainia.\"",
                "This is the thought the closed lips of Father Osyp utters today, while in his eyes one could see the fire burning for the love and willingness of his young life to become an offering on the altar of our dear Ukrainia and of all her oppressed Ukrainian people.",
                "As a priest, Father Osyp (Joseph) believed he could do a great deal of good for his people here in America. Within a few months Father Osyp made acquaintance with the most influential Americans, who honored and valued him even though he was young. Father Osyp was the first Ukrainian in Chicago who really knew how to interest Americans in the Ukrainians, before whom he oftentimes spoke in the English language. Father Osyp would announce the Ukrainian name wherever he could, and would represent our people as the nicest in the world. He worked the best he could and as a reward for his work in the national cause, he gathered sneers and reproaches from jealous enemies and blind fanatics, who today rejoice at the opportunity of his death, unappreciative to the late Father Osyp's true patriotism and work in the Ukrainian National Church field.",
                "Rejoice, Oh enemies! but know you that the dirt you throw at Father Osyp does not fall on him, but on yourselves. There will come the time when you will become conscious of yourselves and become ashamed of yourselves.",
                "And you, dear friend, brother and Father Osyp, may you rest in peace. May this free American soil that you loved so much as first after dear Ukrainia, be as light as a feather, and a remembrance unto you. May his memory among the Ukrainian people live from year to year evermore."
