                "School days are here again. Some of the older students are anxious to go back to their classrooms and campuses, while many are still in doubt as to whether they would go back or not, because of funds or other important reasons.",
                "Among the students who are lucky to be at school are the new beginners. It is to this group of students that I desire to impart this brief message. Of course, I don't need to tell of your coming problems, because you are conscious of them already. As a countryman of yours, who is anxious and proud to see you attain noble goals in your life, permit me to share with you my personal experiences in the schools, with the hope that I may point out to you some obstacles that you can overcome. Expenses, social re-adjustments, and even the weather conditions will be among your problems. But I could still add another problem, the habit of giving up.",
                "Some people are easily discouraged, because they lack perseverance, courage, and will to go on. Consequently they give up. I feel terribly disappointed about this class of scholars, especially when they are about to complete their studies giving up almost at the finish. They become discouraged, hysterical, cynical, and \"grass root\" critics of the school system. This type of student instead of encouraging you to fight out your difficulties try to force you to quit. If you want to succeed ignore this group of undergraduates. If you happen to meet them just set your heart and mind with your main idea to finish school and college. Some day you will reach the goal of your ambition, and I think you will be contented and happy because you have struggled hard for it. The quitter did not give it to you, you captured it with your own efforts, and deserve the praise of other people and mine."

He seemed not to be aware of the fact that, as Publisher, he would be held responsible for all that appears in the publication. The Publisher is responsible in the intricate relationship that exists between himself, irresponsible workers, and writers. He must know and understand his duties and responsibilities.

If the Publisher does not know that, if he does not yet know the real make-up of the Filipino Community, and if he is still ignorant of the sensitive characteristics of the Filipino race, then it is time now for him to marshall and call up the members of his staff to come to a meeting, and for them to device a good policy so as to publish only accurate news and unbiased articles conducive to the general good of the race, which it claims to represent. Furthermore, he should see to it that writers in such a \"sheet\" must be men who know the real value of newspaper work and the sacred mission of the press. That it owes to its reading public the publication of facts. Men in this particular calling should know that! They must know what they are doing and what they are writing about. They must be responsible men, broadminded, who know how to sacrifice a personal grudge for good principle, how to gather facts rather than distort them, and, lastly, they must possess the ability to interpret and to discuss issues justly. The Filipinos in Chicago are people with pride! They should not be foolish, careless or make unnecessary misrepresentations, thus suffering the humiliation before the American public, especially before the American benefactors who hold for them the best of admiration, the warmest of regard, and the highest of personal esteem."

Those of us who have been in Manila on days of special events were exceedingly impressed by the seriousness with which the country entered into this matter of adding a new nation into the family of nations. In Manila also were many distinguished guests from abroad; the Vice-President of the United States, John Garner; the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Joseph W. Byrnes and the late Secretary of War, George H. Dern, who was the official representative of the President of the United States. There were also many press representatives from the greatest periodicals in America. It was a rare event that was to be witnessed. Here was the birth of a new nation not torn out of the territory of another nation, not seceding from its Motherland, not protesting oppression and hate and distrust, but a nation having secured its adulthood by worthy achievements.\"",

When they reply that the Philippines are moving along much as it always did we cannot be certain that our questioners are not somewhat distrustful of our answers. But why should there have been an immediate upheaval of governmental affairs? Have the very men at the helm of this new ship of state not been for years under training to do the very tasks they are doing? For years Filipinos themselves have been in more or less complete control of their government. To be sure there were three very important positions held by appointees of the President of the United States, the Governor General, the Vice-Governor, and the Insular Auditor. At times these three men did step in and say that this or that could not be. But by and by the diplomatic Filipino leaders could win over even these three men by a new approach.",
                "\"For years the Filipinos have been faced with the responsibility of financing their government without financial help from abroad except in the form of legitimate loans. No part of the recent millions poured into the C.C.C. camps, P.W.A. work and other alphabetical projects has been allotted to the Philippines.",

                "Questions Commonly Asked Regarding the Philippines",
                "\"Since leaving the Philippines in June of this year, I have had the opportunity of attending two international conferences, one on education in Honolulu and the Institute of Pacific Relations Conference at Yosemite Park. Several questions were asked repeatedly at these conferences and they have been asked many times since. They are: 1. Have the Philippines not cost America vast sums? 2. Are Americans in the Philippine service not paid by the American government? 3. Do Filipinos wish Independence? 4. Do the great mass of people know that they have independence? 5. Can the Philippines maintain its independence? 6. Is the Philippines not afraid that Japan will take the Philippines? Now let us discuss these questions briefly.",
                "\"America has spent great sums of money in the Philippines, but not for development. She has kept an army there from the outset and has enlisted Filipinos in the American army. These Filipino soldiers, called Philippine Scouts, have been paid by America. Americans who have retired from the army and who have chosen to live in the Philippines and Filipino Scouts who have retired are paid or their widows are paid their pensions. America paid Spain for the Philippine and later paid heavily in subjugating the Filipinos after having purchased their territory from Spain. Certainly America has spent vast sums in the Philippines. This has been the price America has paid for a naval and military base in the Far East and for the protection of her hoped for trade in the entire Orient. In the meantime, the Philippines have become America's eighth best world market and America has profited otherwise through trade relations. But with all of this expenditure the Philippines have progressed only in so far as it has paid its own way.",
                "\"The second question has surprised me much more. This is, 'Are Americans in the Philippines service not paid by America?' Let it be known that they are not and never have been. Even the salary of each of the three appointees of the President of the United States mentioned awhile ago was paid by the Philippine government. The Bureau of Insular Affairs at Washington has served as an appointing agency for the Philippines and has sent hundreds of teachers to the Philippines giving them an order for railroad and steamship fares. But these expenditures have been paid ultimately by the Philippines. America has not paid the salary of Americans in the Philippine service except of course members of the United States service.",
                "\" 'Do Filipinos wish independence?' is the third question. The answer is, 'They do.'",
                "\"Some ask, 'Do the great mass of Filipinos know they have independence?'",
                "Again the answer is, 'They do.' I doubt if there are very many isolated communities even in the non-Christian regions which have not heard repeatedly that the Philippines has independence. The schools alone, of which there are over 7,800, touch closely the lives of many million souls and through the schools the matter of independence has been repeatedly presented.",
                "\"'Can the Philippines maintain independence?' They must. The income of this new nation must be stretched where it is most needed. Taxes must be increased, and, if necessary, expenditures for items formerly thought essential must be curtailed.",
                "\"And finally the question which so many anxiously ask, 'Will the Philippines be taken over by Japan?' Who can predict correctly the political future of any nation today? Who would have said five years ago that Ethiopia would have fallen into the hands of another nation? Who would have expected the present government of Spain to be so forcefully attacked? Is the U.S.S.R. strengthening or weakening? We have both points of view. Will India become free? What will happen to Java? Will China continue in its present far-reaching reconstruction? Will the results of the Mexican revolution be the success hoped for? Who knows the answers to these questions?",
                "\"Japan has repeatedly said that she does not desire the Philippines. That she desires Philippine trade is obvious. The Philippines has raw products of all types which Japan could use and is using. Naturally the Philippines will buy from those who buy from her just as Canada and the United States are closely linked commercially. If America loses its eighth best world market, she must remember the tariffs which she imposed on Philippine goods. The dairymen who are severe in their objection to the entry of Philippine coconut oil close their eyes selfishly to the fact that the Philippines are America's best foreign market for dairy products. Philippines can buy dairy products from Switzerland, from Australia, and from other places.",
                "\"Will Japan take the Philippines? Who knows? The Filipinos think not. Their reasons are as valid as are the reasons of those who think differently.\"",
                "America and the Philippines",
                "\"America has been altruistic in its domination of the Philippines. It has constantly and very carefully refrained from exploiting the Philippines.",
                "What America has gained has been the mutual trade relations existing between the two countries and a Far East military and naval base. She must have considered these vital or she would not have gone to the expense and difficulty of wresting the Philippines from Spain and then subduing the Filipinos themselves who thought they had achieved independence by revolt from Spain back in 1896.",
                "\"The whole structure of the Philippines government has been one of the implantation of American ideals. This has been true in education, health and sanitation, civil service, land registration, the judiciary, internal police in the form of the constabulary, and financial administration. The Americans sent to the Philippines in the early period---Worcester, Carpenter, Heiser, Pershing and others--built well. The weaknesses of the American government were not copied; the values were copied. Chief executives sent to the Philippines have been personages, not just people. Here are Taft, Forbes, Harrison, Stimson, Wood, Davis, Roosevelt and Murphy with many other splendid men who have served as Vice Governors, such as Hayden and Gilmore, both prominent in American educational circles today. Men in America who have dominated Philippine affairs, as stated by Malcolm, are Elihu Root and William Howard Taft until 1913 and later Woodrow Wilson, Leonard Wood, Henry L. Stimson and more recently Franklin D. Roosevelt. Great men---all of them.\"",

                "\"Although a ward of America for 33 years and known to the world since 1521 and known to China in records since 1300, still America knows relatively little about the Philippines. In the first place, many Americans place Manila in Cuba as often as they place it in its rightful place. Repeatedly American friends when talking of the Philippines expose their lack of knowledge of its location by asking about Honolulu in the next breath.",
                "\"Do the Americans know that the Philippines were first discovered when the first peoples went into that region over land bridges probably some 20,000 to 25,000 years ago? Later migrations went by sea perhaps some 6,000 to 8,000 years ago. Still later the Malays arrived. These various migrations carried into the Philippines the culture of India, Arabia, and China.",
                "\"Do American people know how their wards live? Do they know of their culture or their philosophy? Do they know any of their songs, their folk lore, or their folk dances? Have they heard any Filipino compositions in music? Have they seen Filipino art? Do they know the status of the Filipino in education? Do they know that here is an Oriental group of which 80 per cent or more are Christians? One might also say that America is rather ignorant of the Orient in general.",
                "\"Recently the Pacific area awoke to the fact that the Pacific Coast and the Pacific area itself should know the Pacific basin better. As a result the Hawii branch of the Institute of Pacific Relations has had prepared a book on Russia entitled Russia by Miss Helen Pratt - from the Tsarist Empire to Socialism - and another on Japan, where ancient loyalties survive, for use in the public high schools. A book on Philippines for a similar use has also been prepared by Mr. and Mrs. Keesling of the University of Hawaii. The book on Japan must be authentic since, if any information is correct, a great newspaper syndicate in America has branded it as pro-Japanese and the Japanese co-author withdrew from authorship because it was anti-Japanese. What recommendation could be better?",
                "\"There are magazines published in Manila worthy of inclusion in American public and private libraries. Are they there? There are books published about the Philippines which could give Americans facts about the Philippines, Filipino life, literature, and government. Are they to be found in American libraries? Has America really set out to acquaint herself about this possession which was hers for 38 years?\"",
                "Basis of America's Lack of Knowledge",
                "\"America has been so intent upon developing an American culture that it has not always been tolerant of the culture of others. We first began by killing off the savage Indian. Just now we are really beginning to realize what an ancient and important culture the man we call the Indian had.",
                "\"America, too,often criticizes the culture of others simply because it is different no matter how ancient. China must laugh at America and other nations of the earth who try to impose a so-called Western or Occidental culture, whatever these terms mean, on her culture far more ancient.",
                "\"Again the American and the white race look with scorn and sometimes contempt upon all people whose skin is not fair. One may say in justice, however, that those who believe in the supremacy of the white man over the yellow or black or brown man are decreasing.",
                "\"Americans ask about the Filipino who comes to America, 'Why does he wear such brightly colored shirts? Why does he wear trousers with such high waists? Why does he do this and that in the way of dress?' Yet what could be more freakish than the American ladies' hat of 1936? And how could the shirts worn by the American men be any more deep-toned than they are?",
                "\"Tolerance, too, often is a long-range matter. We preach tolerance, love of one's fellow men, international friendship and brotherly love. We even spend thousands of dollars annually to send missionaries to foreign lands, including the Philippines, to carry with them good will. Close-up tolerance becomes something very different. Why is it that the Negro in Columbus, Ohio, cannot eat in the ritzy downtown hotels? Why is it that the Negro students at Emporia, Kan., my Alma Mater, cannot eat in the campus cafeteria? Why is it that at Ohio State University that Negro students cannot go beyond the second year in the R. O. T. C. where he could achieve some rank, better than a sergeant? Why do we call our born citizens or children of foreign born citizens Wops, Dagoes, Chinks, Japs? One could mention innumerable illustrations of lack of brotherhood which we preach. When it comes to our own front yard our tolerance often disappears.",
                "\"The Filipinos are not blameless, nor the Chinese, nor the Japanese, nor the Negro. They are intolerant, too, either because they think they are better than the rest of the world or because of self-defense. The Filipino has a name for that American which is 'Cano', an abbreviation of 'Americano.' It carries with it varying degrees of connotations from hate and fear to lighter ranges of gentle fun-making or of providing a nickname.",
                "\"One might mention that Hawaii, which is a more intimate part of the United States than the Philippines has ever been, has developed far more satisfactory race relations than has the mainland. Much remains to be accomplished even in Hawaii before the situation is as ideal as it is in Brazil where, I have been told, everyone is Brazilian whether white, yellow, red, brown, black, or mixture of all, yet the Hawaii situation is something worth examining. Perhaps we can find out what Hawaii and Brazil have done to eliminate intolerance which we have not done.\"",
                "Philippine Social Life",
                "\"Every culture has its particular characteristics which are admired by other races in spite of differences generally. One trait of the Filipino which I wish to mention is the close family ties. Where in America the home is broken up into many homes, the parents being left behind to mourn the departure of the children one by one, the Filipino home remains more closely compact, and this is, in spite of an American system of education and a moral code, more or less transplanted to the Philippines. The care of the aged, the help given to brothers and sisters, cousins, nieces, and nephews, and even more distant relatives is an ancient and firmly established practice in the Filipino home life. No sacrifice is too great if it is to aid a member of the family to rise to higher places in a career.",
                "\"One other characteristic in Filipino society which must not be overlooked is the important place held by women, something unique in the Orient. Neither is this an implantation from Spain. Legaspi himself, the first Spanish Governor General, wrote that the Filipinos treated their women well and respected them.\"",
                "Philippine Achievement",
                "\"When one studies the achievements of the various dominated groups in the Pacific area one finds a vast gap in the Practices followed. A few contrasting achievements may be mentioned. 1. The Philippines believe in educating as many people as possible as contrasted with certain other Pacific areas which propose to give as little education as possible to as few as possible.",
                "2. The Philippines have adopted a world language (English) as the medium of instruction where other Pacific regions have utilized the narrowing vernacular.",
                "3. The Philippines have attempted to utilize the heritage of world culture as contrasted with the fostering of a narrow local culture only.",
                "4. The Philippines have pushed forward leaders as rapidly as possible and as many as possible and from any level as contrasted with other Pacific areas which carefully selected a choice few for leadership.",
                "5. The Philippines represent an assimilation of cultures of many races and a blending of blood and culture as contrasted with a strict segregation of races as practiced in certain Pacific regions.",
                "6. The Philippines have made education the problem of the state, strictly separated from the church, as contrasted with other Pacific regions which virtually turns education over to religious bodies.",
                "7. The Philippines have allowed nationalism to develop to its utmost without any hampering restrictions as contrasted with certain Pacific regions which strive to prevent any nationalistic activity unless it be good nationalism. To be sure, good nationalism in this sense is nationalism which is good in the eyes of the dominant group.",
                "\"It may be stated that another educational achievement in which the Philippines take pride is the fact that the oldest University under the American flag is in the Philippines. This is the University of Santo Tornas organized in 1611, a quarter of a century before Harvard.\"",
                "Selling Philippine Culture",
                "\"America, not having acquainted itself fully with the Philippines and what the Philippines has to offer to world culture, it becomes the task of the Philippines as a new nation to sell itself to the world and to America. The Filipino in America is the best exponent which the Philippines has. Let us reveal to America somehow the art, music, folk lore, folk dances, costumes, literature, and other cultural phases of the Philippines. How can this be done? Let me suggest a few matters which will probably suggest others to you:",
                "1. Bring to America, by gift if necessary, to art museums, representative copies of the paintings of the leading artists such as de la Rosa, Amorsolo, Lorenzo, Buenaventura, Ancheta, Ocampo, David and others.",
                "2. Bring to America some of the beautiful Madonnas and other figures carved so exquisitely by Nepomuceno, in the beautiful yellow molave hardwood.",
                "3. Bring to America a representation of the sculpture of Tolentino.",
                "4. Let the American people hear Philippine folk songs, either from phonograph records or played from sheet music.",
                "5. Let Americans see Philippine folk dance, not just the \"Carinosa\" which is danced to death but also dances particularly the typically Philippine dances with the least of Spanish influence. One I might mention is the \"Tinikling\" from Samar which was the most popular of all the folk dances shown by the Philippine Boy Scout troop which came to America last year.",
                "6. Let America see more of the beautiful Philippine costumes, both men's and women's costumes. How many men tonight are wearing a Barong Tagalog or Camisa Chino? True it's rather chilly for such a costume in the late Chicago fall. America being subject to new styles, perhaps with the right sort of propaganda you may induce the young men of America during summer to wear the Camisa.",
                "7. Let America hear the instrumental and vocal compositions of Abelardo, Santiago, Vallejo, Molina, Hernandez, Buenaventura, Estella, Buencamino, Tapales, Carnejo, and others. Christmas is near and schools, churches, and societies are planning Christmas Carols. Will any be singing Santiago's Christmas Carol? How many of this audience has heard the beautiful soprano solo \"i Maya?\"",
                "\"We can begin by placing paintings on the walls of Filipino club houses in America, by gathering together a collection of Philippine phonograph records, and by acquiring a library of musical compositions for club houses. The next step is to make them into homes, public buildings, and art museums just as exquisite examples of Chinese and Japanese art are so found.",
                "\"List of the best books on the Philippines may be made up and sets acquired for club houses in Chicago, Stockton, Los Angeles, New York, or wherever there is a considerable number of Filipinos. The Filipino Association of Chicago could start such a movement. Who can tell how far reaching it might be? Many in America wish to know the Filipino and his culture; they are sincere in this desire but they do not know how to make the start.",
                "Let us all help first by informing ourselves of our own culture and then by relaying this information vigorously, persistently, and objectively to America. In other words sell the Philippines to America. More than ever before is this essential. As a ward of America the Americans should themselves have discovered the old Philippines. Since they did not do so let us discover the new Philippines for America.\"",

In 1946, there might not be another Mr. Roosevelt, and the Philippines might go back to the old Philippine Islands Possession of the United States, so good friends and neighbors, have nothing to worry about in such a quota."

The Community Center which has been the Mecca of all Filipinos in America has less attraction of late to draw the crowd. The Center is conducting many social activities with the aid of the various clubs, to foster education in general.",

                "Upon this bulwark of solid reasoning you have witnessed tonight the seemingly apparent ship-wreck of the Negative side; and likewise, perhaps how in the oxygen of the inexorable reality which the Affirmative has presented...all of the Negative's fantastic theories about \"originality\"....and the utterly vain lamentations for the so-called lost Filipino freedom of individual and inner self-expression have thoroughly crumbled to pieces and have been reduced to more idle vapourings--thus rendered absolutely devoid of any validity.",
                "Now, my friends, I have outlined before you tonight some of the positive accomplishments which American Occupation has wrought for us. The outline may appear prosaic, as it is a tale of \"common things;\" but upon scrutiny, it will be found to include most of the factors which minister not merely to the material but also to the mental and moral progress and uplift of our people. Through American Occupation we, as a people, have come in contact with the best that American leadership has to offer, thereby enabling us to enjoy the glorious blessings which are indispensable to a vital and genuinely progressive national life....to secure and enjoy that which other nations and peoples had to struggle and fight for with their pen and blood. Through the superior guidance of gracious America we have thus been enabled to enjoy untrammelled the most hard-earned, most precious, and richest heritage of mankind with the least possible price and sacrifice on our part.",

As a pure-blooded Filipino myslef, I praise their glories, and my heart bleeds with every solemn memory of their bitter miseries. Notwithstanding, these, however, facts are facts, and for our purpose it is, always fair that credit and honor should be given where they are due. For those in whose heart and minds still lingers the darksome doubt as to the ingenuousness of benevolent America, the answer is not far to seek--and if remember we must, then let us remember that as with individuals, so it is with nations: \"By their fruits, ye shall know them.\"",

He is bitter against the environment in which he lives, bitter against the world, and, worst of all, bitter against himself. The longer he stays here the poorer his sense of value becomes. If these observations are correct, then his coming to the United States is a detriment! We cannot say whether he is to blame entirely. He is forced to go thru experiences which he never dreamed of doing under the ordinary circumstances in the Philippines. He is forced to associate with the wrong class of people of his own race. He has to live and, therefore, has to work, and more often than not, he has to resign himself to the domain of the kitchen, the garden, and the ranch--they are the only places that seem to welcome him. He complains of racial snobbery even in school. He is segregated in many theatres. He is banned in many barbershops. He is not welcome in some restaurants. He is looked down with playful contempt anywhere. No wonder if he grows bitter with the years and contemplates vengeance on the Americans in the Philippines when he returns home.",
                "This is only one side of the picture. There are many of our boys who have made friendships with the best Americans during their stay here and have, therefore, become enriched in their experiences. The usual complaint that the Americans in the Philippines are treated with hospitality and consideration while the Filipinos here receive just the opposite is, in the majority of cases, true. But, after all, our characters are revealed in the way we rise above unseemly situations, in the way we form friendships in an unfriendly environment. Many times the fault lies in us, because we expect too much. A little jolt now and then, a little slight here and there, sets us aflare with indignation--and the result is, we lose control of ourselves and therefore of the situation!",
                "There are many Americans who are good just as there are many Filipinos at home who are good. In fact, this can be said of any other people. And we cannot forget the friendship formed under the glow of college days. We cannot forget the American mothers who stood by us when we are sick and many times hopeless. We cannot forget our American professors who are very helpful and friendly to us. We cannot forget the Christian American families who helped us to find work, who were kind to us and solicitous about our welfare. We cannot forget the Christian Ministers and Christian People who helped us to bear our problems by their sincere friendliness. No, we cannot forget these! These are the things that live even long after we have returned to our homes.",
                "There are many of these friendships here if we simply try to seek them sincerely and patiently. It is only a matter of approach and understanding, of making allowances for the ways, outlooks, and manners that are different from ours. Then, too, it is a matter of showing to these people that we are worthy of their friendship. How can we make friends and know the better class of Americans if we confine our association with our own people who often are not of the class that we will choose to go with under normal conditions in our own country? How can we know the right Americans, if we seek the places where the lights are red and enjoy the pleasures that feed the flesh and starve the mind and soul?",
                "Our stay in America will prove, either as a detriment, or a benefit, depending upon our choice of association. Whether we go home as an asset or as a liability depends upon the kind of contacts we make here. We hope we will not be like the educated Filipino who despises everything American because he was ill-treated when he was here. We do hope we will be like the other educated Filipino whose character was made stronger, richer and more beautiful because he chose to know the right Americans while he was here. There is no use for bitterness, nor disillusionment. We make or unmake ourselves by our attitudes."

This type of cultured person does not necessarily require a string of degrees from colleges and universities. Just what are the qualities the Filipino women are striving to acquire? First of all, she is striving to be creative, whether it be in beholding the sunset or the sunrise, whether it be reading a book or magazine, or whether it be living among her fellowmen. What does she attempt to create? It might be a painting. It might be a book. It might be an idea. It might be a new social order. Whatever it is, her personality develops, becoming fuller and richer.",
                "She has the sense of unity--unity of ideals and purposes, of integration; of personality; unity of life; oneness with God and fellowmen. Now humanity claims her love and loyalty. She loves God and her fellowmen genuinely. This is the dynamic power in life. This is the flame that gives her life warmth and glow. This is the divine fire that purges her of unkindness, of pride, of wrath, of selfishness, and of vulgarity. This is the clear magic glass through which she looks so she can see something good in the bad, something beautiful in the ugly, and something divine in mankind.",
                "She is in quest not only of beauty and goodness, but also of truth. In her quest, Agnosticism and Scepticism may go along. Reason and Intuition are her indespensable guides. Mysticism is one of her main highways. She re-evaluates, re-defines, and re-clarifies her purposes, ideals and beliefs, especially in her quiet hour with God.",

She believes in this friendly universe, in the natural laws supporting her strivings and aspirations. The tempest of life may disturb the surface of her life but within she remains calm and serene.",
                "In brief, the Filipino women are seeking abundant life, not only for themselves, but for all. Being lovers of the home and conscious of the fact that the home is the fundamental unit of society, they prepare themselves to be fine homemakers. They learn the fine art of living, the art of home-making, the fine art of being a wife, or of being a comrade to their husband, and the fine art of motherhood. Then, too, they believe that they owe the community the bigger home.",

They have entered almost all fields of human endeavor, not as competitors of men, but as co-workers with men to make the community more homelike.",

Personally, I believe that your aspirations--you American women--are no less than these. Yes! I can see all the world, hand in hand, and shoulder to shoulder, building a fairer world where love, joy, and peace reign."

                "Miss Lucille Windett, a university woman and teacher of art, has brought before Filipino groups some of the most cultured and envisioned experts in the city to open up art and other subjects to their inquiring minds. For six months an average of four speakers and teachers a week have been brought by Miss Windett to come to the Filipino Community Center without recompense to teach the things that are vital to the social and economic problems.",

Gonzales, whom the Associated Filipino Press properly evaluates as the \"greatest Filipino social worker in America today, and as such he deserves to be citizen No. 1 of the community\".",
                "What impresses me as most remarkable in the scores of Filipinos I have been in touch with, is the determination to improve their minds, not only in order to make a better living, but to inculcate true appreciation of the finer things in life and in the beauty in things around us. I am of the opinion that the Filipinos are more earnest in this search than the average young American.",
                "Culture - that refinement we get from high minded artists and serious books, and that has nothing to do with making money, but that enriches life whether we are poor or well-to-do, this is the goal toward which so many of these young men are aiming. They have chosen a good objective. Money may be lost, but love of beautiful things, appreciation of a noble book and sympathy with all efforts to live in, will remain through the whole span of life, a never failing source of enjoyment.",
                "The open-mindedness of the Filipinos excites my admiration. I have found no bigots, no narrow minded partisans among them. They weigh this or that system of philosophy or art and religion, and appropriate that which seems to them to be the best.",
                "The feeling of Americans like myself is that we want to do a little something to show them that the United States does not want to exploit them. Big hearted Americans want to show them the Christ spirit, to love and help thy neighbor and to oppress them in no way. The world has no other example where a controling nation has said to a dependency, \"remain with us or go on as an independent government and you have our best wishes\". America has sent the best teachers and administrators to the Philippine Islands and its hope and expectation is that the Islands will become beacon lights of learning and gentle arts of peace to the millions of the Asiatic continent and the islands of the sea.",
                "The Filipino young men in our midst love self-expression. They practice public speaking and debate, train themselves in parliamentary law, and many of them are fluent writers for their newspaper press. This denotes that they have a high degree of social consciousness and it is hoped by their well-wishers that when, and if they decide to paddle their own canoe as a race, they will use these national characteristics for the welfare of their country, rather than to waste their time in wordy and fruitless harangues that accomplish nothing. Who can tell how many leaders are being developed in this intellectual center who are destined to be the directors and councilors of a greater and more influential Filipino nation?"

We need your faith and confidence to enable us to cope with various conditions of human ailments. Your undivided support would substantiate the purpose of the Filipino physicians and dental professions.",
                "In our experiences in the practice of medicine and dentistry in Chicago, we have many occasions to see patients who were in need of hospitalization but could not have it due to lack of funds. To such a misfortune we are all subject sooner or later during our existence; but through well organized community we can establish an institution of our own which will take care of ourselves. This New Deal is a challenge to every thinking Filipino who unselfishly lives his life. This movement we have initiated is not only needed in the City of Chicago but also in other cities in the United States where there are Filipinos. Not long ago the birthday of President Franklin D. Roosevelt was celebrated throughout the nation and has been capitalized to obtain funds for care of sufferers of Infantile Paralysis. Over a million dollars have been raised to perpetuate the humanitarian principles which will serve as a monument to the New Deal.",

Keep up your faith, devotion and prayers for our countrymen who are in sympathy with our many mistakes and pitfalls.",

To alleviate our suffering the medical and dental professionals have thought of this movement; furthermore, we cannot escape old age and therefore, it is essential not to forget the New Deal which we are presenting for your consideration now. The New Deal is ours and we must support it at any cost.",

As a consequence we have to resort to charity institutions which are not much interested in us. Through cooperation we can make the New Deal of service to all.",
                "There are at least five thousand Filipinos in the city and several hundred families with approximately seven hundred to one thousand children in whom we are profoundly interested. The majority of these families are sufficient to provide professional medical care. The minority perhaps are forced to apply to the various city clinics for medical treatment. The aim of the New Deal is primarily to extend a helping hand to those who are otherwise unable to obtain medical aid. Frequent examinations of these children will prevent many untold sufferings both for the parent and the child. Deformities and complications are great drawbacks in the future attainments of our children We solicit your faith in us and remember that it is our earnest purpose to give you the best that medical science can afford.",

We need the support of everyone at all times. We must start somewhere no matter how small; hence, we need your moral and financial support.",
                "Financial Sources",
                "We don't hesitate to say, without reservation, that our existing organizations of the city and American friends will gladly cooperate with the New Deal. To maintain such an institution it requires money. There are thousands of dollars that are being raised and paid out by various organizations to the hotels of this city every month for entertainment purposes.",
                "From every such function held by an individual club to help the New Deal enough should be realized to purchase the necessary instruments and bandages. Such funds will furnish a substantial income for the maintenance of the dispensary clinic.",
                "While attempting a relatively new movement in the field of human endeavor the scope of the New Deal is fulfilling an important requirement in this new era of the progress of civilization and the advancement of the Filipino race. The New Deal was conceived as a powerful influence in cementing a firmer relationship between our brothers far and near through a common bond of human interest. In sponsoring this ideal we believe that the time has arrived to broaden our social, professional and economic horizon.",

We look forward with hope and courage, for better days and better friendship for the great family for the imperishable brotherhood of all Filipinos. We shall always cherish with affectionate pride the memories that linger from our association in this New Deal for the advancement of human happiness. Let us hear from you. Let us have your suggestion for building this New Deal into the kind of a resting place that you believe will be most beneficial to you and the community."

Templeton, Dr.Guthrie, Mrs. Wilson, and many other American benefactors, who are responsible for the promotion of the undertakings of the Filipino Community Center, knew, and still know, too well, that the life of a public man is not rosy, especially the life of a director of a Filipino Community Center. They know that a leader cannot please all the different groups in his community, because it is practically impossible for a leader to satisfy all, especially the Filipinos, who are the hardest people on earth to please, and who talk too much, but act little.",
                "I hope that this may serve as a candid pointer, especially to those who talk excessively against Director Antonio A. Gonzales of the Center. It is always disgusting to hear those whom he helped, aided, secured positions for, loaned money to, now criticize him behind his back.",
                "That is always the case in every community, the one who is doing something is the one bound to be criticized. If this is not so, then a Filipino \"Saint\" is wanted, to become a Director of the Filipino Community Center of Chicago."

Wilson, one of the founders, called the meeting to determine whether or not the Center was needed and if so, whether the Filipinos would support it. In his introductory speech, the Chairman stated that the Center is a great expense to maintain. Money, he said, was taken away from other worthy enterprises for this purpose, but if it is not needed and if it is not supported, he felt it was unfair to continue, since there are so many other worthwhile undertakings waiting to be projected. The members of the board want to know, he further stated, the Filipino sentiments toward the Center.",
                "IS CENTER WANTED?",
                "\"Do the Filipinos of Chicago want the Center such as it is today, or as it might be?\" Mr. Templeton asked the group. \"What do you feel its program should be, or what specific advantages do you think it should provide? Do you favor additional social activity? If we can develop such a program as you may suggest, what support can we expect from the Filipino group?\"",
                "The group was urged to offer whatever comments they had. In answer to this challenge, the Reverend Tierra, guest pastor of the Filipino Community Center Church, said:",
                "\"There is no doubt that the Center is needed. There are many clubs in the city, but the Center is the only place where all Filipinos can gather without sectionalism. It gives religion to the people which no other organization does. Because of the interest you Americans have shown in strengthening the Center, it gives encouragement and pride to face the rest of the world.\"",

                "Rustico de Guzman, president of the Katipunan Party of the F.A.C., felt that the Filipino Association of Chicago would not support the Center for a very definite reason. He felt however that the Center was badly needed in this city.",

Duerme, President of the Zambales Club, stated. \"I only hope that more jobs in the Center and bigger pay may be given to the Filipinos so that they can best show their support.\"",
                "Julio Lorenzana, Ex-president of the F.A.C., suggested that the Filipino Center should be free from the politics of the city. \"It should be the welfare department of all the provincial clubs in this city,\" he said. He advised the adopting of musical, religious singing, social and religious activities. People crave educational talks, he added.",
                "\"I am for the Center one hundred per cent, but I suggest that the pool hall be abolished entirely\", Jarge Frianeza, one of the leaders of the Filipino Junior Assembly, said. \"It does not provide the right atmosphere. It is a disgrace to see a poolroom wide open especially on Sundays, directly across from the Moody Bible Institute, where people go to commune with God. I also think the Center should provide occasional lectures.\"",
                "\"It is hard for Filipinos to get work,\" he added, \"Therefore, I think, an employment department should be run. The Center lacks a homelike atmosphere. Why couldn't we start a club, which would provide books, lectures, and comfortable chairs? We could charge the members five dollars as annual dues. If we got one hundred members, that would amount to over one thousand dollars a year.\"",
                "Mr. Templeton interceded, \"A thousand dollars would go a long way, further than the Filipinos have yet gone.\"",
                "Mr. Frianeza explained that the proposed club would be apart from the Center. It was not decided just how this would affect the non-members.",
                "Francisco A. Lopez, publisher of the Associated Filipino and Oriental Press, wondered why the Filipinos could not give a part of what they spend on social functions to the Center. Other suggestions are: A department for women; the combining of all the Filipinos' organizations in the city under the Center; offering courses in psychology; developing a children's department; and introducing athletics.",
                "CANNOT ACT IMMEDIATELY.",
                "\"Since these are just suggestions,\" the chairman concluded, \"we cannot expect to carry each one out. However, those that the board consider most practical and possible, we will undertake. Do not expect us to do this immediately, however, but gradually we shall make the Center as you wish. We have a different outlook upon the situation after this talk with you, and we now realize that you, speaking for your groups, want the Center. If the Filipinos do not give it their support, it cannot exist.\""

He willingly appropriated much of his hard-earned cash for ballroom rental, orchestra and very little for publicity. Deficits were always, in many respects, the result. In him was quite apparent the stamp of the \"social climber\" and \"sucker\". He did not care how much he had to spend, as long as he was called \"Senior President.\" Today, it is quite different.

Gonzales, of the Filipino Community Center, held the most recent international dinner right in the Filipino Community Center's Chapel. It was well attended by religious leaders in the city, representatives of foreign nations, and the press, and as a result, there was manifested amongst the diners a true fellowship which had never been equalled in past years. Financially, too, it was a success.",

                "After these servises Rev. Laxamana and Mr. Gonzales escorted the visitors to the gayly decorated social room where they immediately caught the festive spirit of their hosts. The first part of the evening was spent in playing games and learning to know each other. Then stunts were performed by three different groups. Rev. Laxamana prepared a varied and interesting program consisting of several numbers by the Filipino stringed ensemble, and vocal selections sung by Mr. Frank Gordon. Then, to the delight of the whole group, refreshments were served and a delicious birthday cake was cut in honor of the birthdays of three members.",
                "At nine o'clock, \"Good-night Ladies\" was sung and the guests departed for home with a new and different attitude toward Filipinos.",

First, the United Pangasinanes of Chicago Inc., have been placed on a level of higer social morality clothed with an atmosphere of voluntary cooperation; second, social consciousness has been developed and is growing among the members; third, some of the difficulties of the members were remedied through collective action by the faithful members.",
                "Let us stand for the spirit of 1932. Let us put all our members on a higher level of social morality. Let us put faith in our hearts and in our individual consciousness. If the individual member of the United Pangasinanes Club is a rational being, and if the United Pangasinanes is an institution created by human beings, it will have weaknesses: (1) From 1932 to 1933 we donated more than $40.00 for the deceased outside our group, and for the unemployed, yet we have entirely forgotten our own sons and daughters. (2) Since the foundation of the United Pangasinanes of Chicago, Inc., we have appropriated money every year for the expenditures of all the departments, yet we failed to appropriate even $1.00 for milk for the sons and daughters of our members. Is that just?",
                "Members of the United Pangasinanes: Let us be kind to our sons and daughters by giving them something that is worth while to remember, something that gives them vigor so that they will become strong men and women in the future. In the last regular meeting of the United Pangasinanes of Chicago, Inc., I introduced a resolution to provide for the withdrawal of $58.00 for milk for the sons and daughters of our members. The resolution was discussed, and it was tabled for the next regular meeting. I expressed my sympathy in the name of the children of our members, but some of the so-called leaders opposed me. The first opponent of the resolution said that it would be an insult to our parents if the United Pangasinanes Club should give them $2.00 each for milk. The second opponent of the resolution said that such a proposal was unconstitutional; and the third argument was expressed in such a way as to change the entire character of the resolution. May God help the Children! Let us not be fooled by these leaders.",
                "Let us be open-minded, let us solve our problems with pure hearts and deeper thinking. When we appropriate money for the deceased, and for the unemployed, although they were not members of our club, nobody said that it was an \"insult\" to their parents. When we withdrew money from the Treasury of the club for prizes, not one of these leaders said that it was an \"insult\" to the parents. If the members of the United Pangasinanes are rational beings, and if the United Pangasinanes Club is an organization of men of high-moral character, then the United Pangasinanes Club has the right to provide the children support, build their moral structure, and it should perform its duty toward its children.",
                "Friends, do not forget our unification in 1932; remember the spirit of 1932; bear in mind that the United Pangasinanes was organized for a good reason and for a high purpose: \"TO PROMOTE OUR COMMON WELFARE,\" etc. There is a time to keep silence, and a time to speak. Now, it is the time for me to speak for the welfare of the children of our members, who have worked hard under the sun and in the rain for the support of the United Pangasinanes Club of Chicago, Inc. Dear Leaders, do not make a movement which tends to lose the interest and confidence of every one.",

These social affairs are mostly inaugural dances of provincial clubs, and are booked practically every Sunday, at high class and expensive hotels, such as Drake, Palmer House, La Salle, Morrison, Congress, Sherman, etc., the provincial clubs paying an approximate rent of $75.00 per night for each affair given. In my opinion, if a part of heaven is found in Chicago and God allows J.P.

Some are in business, while thousands want to be politicians.",

                "Your headline article of September 15, 1936, entitled \"F.A.C. $500 Still Missing,\" surprised me almost at the point of exhaustion and nervous breakdown! It is shocking how some people could be so pretentiously ignorant! They wanted to know where the $500 F.A.C's money was hidden! I would like to suggest not to look for it anymore for there \"ain't no such animal!\" One would think that a certain \"few\", as they called it, pocketed the \"missing $500\" during the previous administration and nonchalantly called it a perfect steal.",
                "It is futile for me to explain the psychological reactions of those members and friends of the F.A.C. Inc., who did not know the exact situation of the Association's treasury. I have definite knowledge from former members and friends of the F.A.C, attitude and the reason why they never cared to belong to that organization is that it's a crooked organization. I am writing this open letter for the benefit of those who did not know the facts of the case and the explanation about the \"missing $500.\"",
                "The truth of the matter is that at the close of that ill-fated, eventful, sensational, royal election day, April 19, 1936, when four hired police-men had to give a helping hand in the recounting of the ballots, the Membership Committee, in the presence of the electoral board members handed me the total receipts of the 336 membership fees amounting to $504, minus the expenditure incurred in the election which was $63, making the net cash balance $441 and not $500, out of this sum other expenses and debts of the F.A.C. Inc., were paid, amounting to $51.15. Now, by mere process of subtraction, one will find that the cash on hand would be ($441-$51.15) $389.85. The F.A.C. Inc., had at that time $3.95 in the bank; adding this to $389.85, we should have, and did have $393.80; and again, may I repeat not the sum of the \"missing $500.\" One will probably notice that I did not itemize the various expenditures, I purposely avoided that, for the simple reason that the report of those expenditures is the property of the F.A.C., Inc., and unless, I am duly authorized by the said Association to devulge its private affairs and undertakings, to do so would not only be unethical but may also be illegal.",
                "Now, one would wonder, \"what became of the $393.80?\" Well, it was on one bright early morning, May 5, 1936, at which time the sun was able to dry the dewdrops on the tops of the Loop skyscrapers, when the president, and the treasurer of the short-lived administration and myself hurriedly went to the First National Bank of Chicago. To be able to withdraw, one must have the signatures of Mr. German Maglaya, and Mrs. J.O Abriam, the president and treasurer, respectively, of the May to July administration.",
                "On June 7, 1936, came the inaugural dance, expenses had to be incurred for its preparations and more expenses were incurred when it terminated. The outgo having been much greater than the income, red ink had to be used in entering it on the debit side of the Profit and Loss account.",
                "Making the \"red\" much \"redder.\" Previous debts of the F.A.C. to Mr. I. Yumul and Mr. F. Ravelo were, either fully or partially paid. The result was according to Mrs. Abriam's report, that $172 is still resting peacefully in one of the safety vaults of the First National Bank.",
                "To demand $550 from the previous administration officials by the present administration, no court would sustain such a demand in the light of the facts I above enumerated. The possible reimbursement that the officials of the previous administration may have to make would be those expenditures incurred in the inauguration, if, and only if the Court should rule that they must be reimbursed. In the event, the Court rules otherwise, the present administration had to be satisfied with $172.",
                "And, before concluding, permit me to add as a matter of suggestion to some people, to refrain from unnecessary insinuations that some \"few\" had done away with something, for they might, unwittingly, include some innocent persons. For, after all, no certain individual or certain group has a monopoly of the Court, you know.",

And again, the only privilege of being able to practice law in some of the states in the Union, is being critically discussed, and it seems that the favorably opinion is on the negative side. Ever since the Filipinos, except those that served in the Army or Navy, cannot become a citizen of the United States, yet a white alien can be.",

Certainly not. Americans have had many big affairs in Chicago where 10,000 people have gathered peacefully, in carrying out their programs and activities. And yet we excuse ourselves by saying that there is \"no hall\" to accomodate a group of Filipino hero worshippers of a number much less than 10,000.Brother, our reasons hold no water, especially when we have already experienced in the past that we could hardly get over 1,000 people to come to the hall that we had rented for the occasion. Another class, of mere figure heads and self-styled leaders, contend that we haven't a club big enough to shoulder the responsibility of organizing such an affair. This is a case of short-sightedness. We could remedy this situation by uniting ourselves, as one body, and selecting a committee to represent the whole. The committee of the whole would be the agency that would represent us all regardless of our Club affiliations, creed, religion, or station of life.",

We who come after must see to it that their names are not forgotten.\""

There were about two hundred couples present at the affair. Rev. Laxamana of the Filipino Community Center, started the affair with a prayer, at the banquet table, which came as an introduction or as a solemn hour tribute to the great martyr.",
                "In showing reverence and respect, Mr. Basilio De Vera, president of the fraternity, lectured on Rizal. He praised Rizal, as a philosopher, and elaborated the great hero's statement: \"If the people must have freedom and self-government, they must be worthy of it, and if the people must stand as a nation, they must be united.\"",
                "\"This\", said the speaker, was the direct answer of Rizal to the Spanish colonial policy, \"keep them in ignorance and keep them divided.\" To support his statement, he cited Rizal's call for organization and service contained in the La Liga Filipina, (Philippine League) while he mentioned Rizal's other works as mainly to denounce tyranny by direct appeal and insinuation. \"Both,\" he said, \"indicated the ramifying elements of solid unity, and in the advent of that restless episode, they stimulated action.\"",
                "In his conclusion he said that all of Rizal's philosophy sprang from his instinctive love of country and hatred of oppression; from rationalism that the rights of oppressed people must be earned by themselves instead of submitting too much to the Christian creed of \"service and suffering\" and too much respect for law; and from experiences abroad where he saw justice, liberty, and equality and the triumphant cause of nationalism preached with success.",
                "Dr. Ernest B. Price of the International House also spoke on the problems confronting the Philippine public. He gave optimistic views in this regard, and was confident that the Filipino graduates of America will play their part well in the solution of these problems.",
                "The celebration, as sponsored by the fraternity, was social, but its purpose was to inculcate reverence for the great martyr whose death has accelerated our thoughts for freedom. The affair was a tribute to his sound and incorruptable human principles."

Today, November 15, 1935, the life history of our Commonwealth begins.

Upon conversing with them, however, one will find such answers as, \"I don't remember that\" or, \"It has been such a long time since I read that,\" or, if they attempt to answer, the answer is vague, if not misleading, leaving the inquirer in the dark.",
