                "The trial of the distinguished aviation instructor, Captain B. J. Venegas, charged with embezzlement, took place last Tuesday at 1:30 P.M. The charges were proffered by Benigno A. Daza, who is a native from Colombia. The charges accuse Captain Venegas of having received $275.00 from the student Daza to be used for the purchase of a plane. A receipt was signed stating that if no purchase had taken place by March 21st, the money would be refunded. As Captain Venegas has neither purchased a plane, nor refunded the money, he was arrested for embezzlement.",
                "The trial was to have taken place last Tuesday at 9:00 A.M., but was delayed due to a great number of other cases. The Venegas case came up only at 1:30 P.M. in the Court of Judge Borrelli, which is located at 48 South Wabash Avenue. Our reporter, who witnessed the disposition of the other cases found Judge Borrelli's decisions to be just and humane ones.",
