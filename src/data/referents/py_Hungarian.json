                "An American author once said that Billy Sunday is the price that Americans pay for not requiring their ball players to be educated. As is well-known, Billy Sunday was once a baseball player who had an idea that the Holy Spirit descended upon him, and since then--either for the material advantages or in sincerity--he believes that he is God's special emissary in America.",

Billy Sunday is a typical go-getter.",
                "While the other go-getters peddle houses, lots, tooth paste, and automobiles, Sunday and his followers sell fairy stories and, with uncouth ignorance, discuss questions which even great scientists have been unable to solve. Their methods are empty, consisting of high-sounding words that flatter their audiences and make them believe they are on the same level of intelligence with the leaders, who ridicule institutions that are above the general public and which they instinctively despise. They have no patience for criticism just like their mob audience. They are crafty because they appeal to the mob's instincts, not to its intellect.",

                "The Hungarian education which was gained by the Hungarian children of West Pullman, was most gloriously exhibited by the Reverend Eugene Boros and his assistant, Daniel Bodor. It was rather sad that the attendance at this affair was rather small compared to that at some of the ordinary dances sponsored by Hungarian societies. There are many reasons for this. One of the main reasons was the terrible heat of the day, and therefore the committee in charge of the affair should have made arrangements to hold it out in the forest preserves somewhere, in true Hungarian style. The other reason was that we noticed there were very few Hungarian Catholics present. In America this is the main fault of the Hungarians. At all of our Hungarian celebrations the different speakers emphasize the importance of co-operation; but when the time comes that a certain celebration should be given due publicity and honored by a large attendance, religious differences and many other things are brought up while the rest of the Hungarians pay little attention. This great holiday of which we are speaking was one in which all Hungarians should have been interested, for it was a celebration of public education in Hungarian for the benefit of our future Hungarian population in America. This celebration should have been such that the American people would have sat up and taken notice of the great cultural development that was taking place among the Hungarians of America.",
                "The development, and the right of a nation to continue its existence depend upon the education and cultural activities of its youth. A nation that cannot show some development in its youth doesn't deserve to exist.",
                "The laws of the United States permit the different nationalities to teach their children the language of the nation from which they originated. It is only natural of course, that if this foreign language school idea is abused these different schools will be closed by the Board of Education.",
                "Approximately fifteen years ago the writer of these lines worked tirelessly to get free space in a public school for the Chicago Hungarians; in this school a Hungarian teacher was to be placed and the English language taught through Hungarian channels to adults. A thousand petitions were sent out by the Chicago Hungarian Independent Song Society to determine how many people were interested in going to evening school, and it was found that the number interested in this plan was much greater than a thousand. Then under the leadership of Dr. Weiner a committee of three appeared at a meeting of the Board of Education. Dr. Weiner presented the request of the Chicago Hungarians, whereupon one of the members of the board said in his reply to the request that it was impossible; his reasons were that the Hungarians did not become citizens of the United States because the Hungarian teachers taught them, and drilled into them undying patriotism. Dr. Weiner then answered this charge very nobly by asking this member of the board, if someone told him to disown his mother, would he do it?",
                "The plan finally won out even over the protest of this individual member of the board. The Hungarian people were allotted free space in one of the schools, and Dr. Erno Lowinger was appointed teacher. His efforts were successful as his classes were attended to capacity at all times. The board then saw how interested the Hungarians were in education and they allotted additional space and appointed an English teacher to conduct these classes, and also appointed an English teacher to assist Dr. Lowinger.",
                "It seems as though it won't be long before the teaching of all foreign languages will be stopped in these parochial institutions. But until that time comes, religious differences should be forgotten, and when these children exhibit their gains in Hungarian culture we should all attend.",
                "More of us should take part in these cultural activities out here in West Pullman because we do not have very many Hungarian cultural organizations, even though this is a good Hungarian community. We do not have a young people's society here; the only place they have to meet one another is in pool halls. Don't you think that it would be a splendid idea to organize a cultural society for the youth? We could have a place for these young people to meet, where there would be all sorts of games, a good library, and every once in a while one of our good Hungarian friends could take it upon himself to give lessons in Hungarian, so that this beautiful language of ours would never die.",
                "It is beautiful to see a Hungarian worker, be it man or woman, who can be at home in a circle of better educated people. I have also noticed that on special occasions when these ordinary workers have been called on to make a speech, there wasn't one who could speak very intelligently. This and many other mistakes could be rectified through a movement for public education for Hungarian adults and young people. The whole world, whether it be in public or business life, loves a cultured and well-educated person."

Aside from the day classes where six or seven hundred thousand children are being educated,evening classes for adults are conducted so that they may have the chance to learn what they may have missed in their childhood. These classes are especially helpful to those of our countrymen who have not been in this country long. They can learn the language and customs of their newly adopted country.",

Why should we deny the fact that this was prohibition only in name and that the law has not served its purpose? There exists only a slight change brought about by this law. If one wants to drink wine, whiskey or beer, he may do so, but it must be done in secrecy. The liquor sold today is of a lower grade and the cost is much higher than previous to prohibition. To be subjected to such a condition is not exactly desirable, but who is satisfied with his present state today? We must adjust ourselves to the situation, regardless of the price we must pay for it.",
                "Now, the whole country is to get a terrible jolt. It was believed that the saloons would be opened so that the people might be able to stock up for the coming dry era. But what happened? The law which was passed to keep this country dry during the War is now going to be fully enforced at once, because Congress has just released millions of dollars to that department of government necessary for this purpose.",
                "We all know that after January 16, the United States will be observing prohibition, and for the next four years there will be no chance of modifying the law. There is very little we can do in the matter, so we must remain satisfied. We have only one hope: that the United States Supreme Court rules it out, saying that this law does not agree with one of the principles of the American government, that is, liberty, which is every man's right. We must not talk about this now. The law has been passed by Congress and signed by the President which means that the 18th Amendment will be strictly enforced within a week. Personally, we do not indulge in alcoholic beverages, nor do we advertise the sale of them, but the whole affair to us seems a laughing matter, because it ignores man's freedom. We will try to explain our ideas very briefly.",
                "There was probably some use for prohibition during the War, because the ingredients of alcoholic beverages were necessary to provide more food for the world. Labor used in the manufacture of liquor was necessary in other industries, and money that was being spent for alcoholic beverages was more valuable as loans to the government during the War.",
                "We are well aware of the fact that prohibition was originally passed as a war measure but that it became effective seven and a half months after the Armistice had been signed. July 1, the saloons were closed as a matter of form only, because the closing did not have any effect on the War situation at that time. Today, it is approximately a year since the War ended and it is a well known fact that due to political entanglements, peace pacts have not been signed, but the lawmakers want to spend millions of dollars on this law as a War measure in order that it might be enforced. To turn a law of this kind into a War measure during the time of peace, does not show any wisdom on the part of congress, nor will it gain the support of the people. On the contrary, the people are certain to show their disrespect for the law and it will increase the number of agitators and crime-bent organizations in this country which are two very undesirable elements to be dealt with now.",
                "At this time we want to warn our readers to avoid any violation of the prohibition law and as far as possible avoid places where alcoholic beverages are sold. This is a timely warning, because the law provides severe punishment for those who sell, buy, or manufacture, alcoholic beverages. We have also heard that some Hungarians are setting up their own stills to make their own brandies and other alcoholic concoctions. People found guilty of doing this can prepare themselves for jail sentences and heavy fines. Many illicit alcohol dealers and manufacturers have been caught already, and the time will come when every one convicted of such crimes will be imprisoned. We advise everyone to give up the unlawful practice of manufacturing alcohol. It is permissible, however to manufacture grape juice for one's own personal use. This, of course, will turn into wine later. We advise people to remain sober in order to avoid entanglements with the law and suffer the consequences.",
                "What our personal ideas are concerning prohibition is of little concern to the law-makers. It is our duty to obey the law and to constrain others to do the same."

We know very well that only a man with clear faculties can wrestle the problems of the day, and is able to intelligently tell of his needs. If this law is carried out fully, we can only say that it will be a great help to the working class. It will realize more fully its responsibilities, and will improve the moral character of man.",

                "As a consequence, those people who are addicted to alcohol will prepare something which will have a far worse effect on them than whisky ever had. Many people will become dope addicts, which is much worse than alcoholism. It is only natural that forbidden fruit is much sweeter. We say without any hesitation that this law may mean a degenerated society in the United States."

This regulation prohibits the use of barley or rye for the manufacture of liquor. The other news item comes from England with reference to their barley and rye crop being insufficient to amply supply the breweries. Since the law prohibiting the manufacture of alcoholic liquors will be enacted, it will make the country dry during the war. This law is not being brought about because this country's crop is insufficient to supply the needs of the nation, but it is because of our alliance in war with other nations. This makes it our duty to provide food to people living in those countries, especially England. So the government of this country needs to divide the crops in such manner that we will retain a certain amount, the rest to be divided among the allies. It seems as though the law enacted by Congress is for this purpose, but looks are deceiving. The truth of the matter is that politics are playing its part. The Temperance League is going to make use of the situation, thereby making this move look like a patriotic move, but at the same time taking a great step towards their objective for which they have been working for some time.",

In England beer or ale is considered one of the necessities of life for a worker. In the United States the law makers are not far-sighted enough to see this.

Furthermore, accusations have been made to the effect that prohibition was the work of the Protestant churches and capital--the Rockefellers, the Kresges, the Fords and the Morgans. This accusation was not entirely groundless, but now that Morrow has taken a stand against prohibition, this old theory is upset.",
                "Today, even capital and the government at Washington realize that prohibition, in its present form, is full of errors and must be changed.",
                "The nomination of Morrow is interesting too from the point of view of the radical workers. New Jersey has been the battleground of communists and radical workers for years.",
                "Unemployment is at its peak in the United States, and the stock markets have never been so hard hit as in the last few months. The population, used to prosperity and plenty, complains about the depression and there is no relief in sight.",
                "Morrow, the typical capitalist, ran for office in spite of these unfavorable circumstances.",
                "This was the time for the workers to bare their fangs and for radical agitators to reap a rich harvest. But what happened? Morrow won by a tremendous margin.",
                "He was not elected by bankers and industrialists, but by hundreds of thousands of workers.",
                "The argument against the election of Morrow--that Wall Street is the center of capital and that Hoover's government will gain another adherent if Morrow becomes senator--was justified. Yet, it was useless to reiterate this to the people.",
                "The people, the citizens of New Jersey, placed their confidence in Morrow's liberalism and even in these crucial times they did not turn to Moscow or to socialist Europe for a solution of their problems.....",
                "It is evident that the American people do not believe in experimentation, in theories, but choose the prosperity and work opportunity that liberal capital offers in a democracy.....",
                "In our opinion, based on our analysis of this problem, Morrow's victory means, on one hand, that prohibition is on the wane and, on the other, that the American working element does not want revolution, rainbow-hued promises and \"isms,\" but butter on their bread, bungalows, autos, and radios, which means that the American worker wants an opportunity to work at reasonably high wages."

They were afraid of Smith's regime because they imagined that he would bring back the drinking debaucheries of the pre-Prohibition era.",
                "The third reason why Hoover won the Presidential election is a political delusion--prosperity, an election slogan, an American trick. They promised good times and plenty of work under the Republican administration.",
                "This plank in the platform was used to bring pressure on the materialistic-minded ignorant people, who are terribly afraid of unemployment.",
                "We are positive that Hoover, as an economic expert, knows that the election of Smith would not have created panic or unemployment.",
                "The natural resources of the United States, coupled with its geographical location, the development of its industry, and the genius of its financial leaders, insure prosperity for future generations. The normal fluctuation, the intervals of economic retrogression, cannot be stopped by Hoover or any of the Republican campaigners.",

But at the same time the Hungarian-Americans cannot understand why light wines should be prohibited. It seems rather unfair that the Volstead Act was enacted without some of us having had something to say about it. The enforcement of the Volstead Act is becoming more stringent each day.",

We have always been for what is right. We believe that the Volstead Act is unjustifiable, and [that] it deprives individuals of personal liberties. But we also believe that the excessive use of alcohol is detrimental to the user, as well as to society as a whole. This is not only true about the alcohol which is manufactured scientifically, but we must consider the harm brought about by alcohol manufactured in homes and [under]other unsanitary conditions; the alcohol manufactured this way probably means death after it has been used for a certain length of time.",

The wine-loving Hungarian people as well as the rest of the population were too busy making good American dollars to pay much attention to what was going on around them. The small but well-organized group of Prohibition fanatics realized, and took advantage of the wide-spread indifference of the masses, their I-can't-be-bothered attitude, and before people knew what was happening they had been shackled with Prohibition. The majority of the States voted for Prohibition, and consequently the Eighteenth Amendment became a part of the Constitution.",
                "Immediately after the war, people realized that they had lost their birthright, and that they had received nothing to compensate them for their loss. Of course, the Prohibition fanatics were responsible for this failure to provide a substitute [for this lost birthright]. As soon as people realized that they had gotten the worst of the deal, the honorable profession of bootlegging came into being. This profession wrought greater havoc in America than the World War ever had. The underworld took on new life and beer-barons sprang up like mushrooms. These gangsters and beer-barons were usually Sicilians, and were naturally quite handy with the gun and the stiletto. Whenever one of their number was killed in gang-warfare, his funeral commanded more respect from the general public than that of a king of a nation.",

They want him to issue a manifesto to the Italian, Irish, and Polish Catholics, urging them to give up their prosperous occupation of bootlegging because it is against the law. We hope that the honored head of the Church keeps out of this controversy. We believe that with the aid of good will and tolerance this issue can be solved in a manner which will satisfy everyone.",

The Bible relates the story of Noah, who had partaken too freely of the juice of the grape. He presented such a sight to his sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, that they had quite a laugh at the sorry plight of their father. Thereupon, an angel of the Lord gave them a piece of his mind. This proves that the scribe who wrote the story of Noah as it appears in the Good Book regarded wine as an excellent thirst-quencher. There are various places in the Bible where the Master openly approves of the use of wine. If wine met with His approval, it must not be wrong for us Hungarians to continue to use it for our own personal pleasure.",

We must admit that wives and children suffered in many cases. We also know that these same saloon-keepers, who made others suffer, would never lend a helping hand to a worthy humanitarian or social cause. We are not sorry to see the saloons go, but we do not understand why a man who sits down to eat a hearty meal should be deprived of enjoying a glass of wine or beer with it.",
                "The pages of history reveal that geniuses were all users of good wine, and that they did their best work while more or less under the influence of the sparkling juice of the grape. These people left behind great master-pieces, the very ones which are admired by our most ardent Prohibitionists.",
                "We admit that some people are rather weak and cannot control their cravings [for liquor]. But why should the majority suffer because a few people cannot control themselves? We Hungarians must suffer, although we enjoy the reputation of being temperate. We are moderate drinkers.",
                "We favor and advocate regulation; we oppose the enactment of Prohibition as contrary to human nature and wise judgment. Legalize light wines and beer! If the fanatics continue in their obstinate insistence on absolute prohibition of liquor, then the next generation of Americans will be composed of imbeciles and degenerates. This will be the consequence of the effects of the poisonous drinks which produce blindness, insanity, and all kinds of social diseases.",

The parents of today are still sticking to the old-fashioned ideas of their parents. When the parents of today were children they had to be good and obedient, because they realized that they were at the mercy of their parents. They could not go out and find work as readily as can be done today.",
                "But during the last generation the world has gone through a great revolution. The profound changes in our economic life have created new problems. The new conditions have forced the parents to send forth their young children to sell papers, magazines, etc. in order that they might earn money. As the child grew older, he or she began to realize the value of money. The child began to realize that he did not have to beg his parents for a nickel so that he could go to a movie. He knew that he could go out and earn money whenever he so desired.",
                "Soon the child goes to work in a factory. His parents force him to turn his wages over to them, and on Saturday or Sunday he is given a few cents for spending money. When this happens, the child wakes up to the fact that he can do better for himself by going elsewhere for room and board, not only because he will then be free to do whatever he wants to with his money but also because there is no one to dictate to him about the regulation of his habits.",
                "The parents must realize that the good old days they enjoyed so much are a thing of the past. The children of today cannot be reared in the same way as we were.",
                "The children of today maintain an attitude of independence, but we think that they should remember the Fourth Commandment: \"Honor thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long upon the land.....\" But more important than this commandment is the law which says that the child will receive the same respect from his children that he has shown his own father and mother.",
                "It is not a very pleasant spectacle to see a tired mother, who has worked hard all day around the house, burdened with a sophisticated daughter who thinks that she is too good to lend a helping hand when she returns home from her job in the office or factory. These haughty girls are not even ashamed to ask their mothers to act as servants to them. We do not say that every girl is like this. There are good girls who help their mothers, but harsh as this may sound, even they will become spoiled when they acquire friends who are not so good to their mothers.",
                "We can see only one way in which this difficult and delicate problem can be solved. The parents must decide whether they want to raise a small number of good children or a large number of bad ones.",
                "The second part of the solution to the problem [calls for a new attitude on the part of the parents]. The parents should be more than mere father and mother to the child; they should also be his good friends, so that whenever he has a problem to solve he can come to his father or mother and discuss the matter as frankly as he would with a friend.",
                "Many parents commit a great mistake in neglecting the child. When they fail to praise the child for the things he has done, the child becomes discouraged and eventually adopts a hostile attitude toward his own parents.",
                "The most important problem of the bay is the maintenance of the family and the home. If these institutions--the family and the home--were to collapse, civilization itself would disappear.",
                "The struggle for existence becomes harder and harder. Competition is taxing the physical and mental powers of man to the utmost. When a man comes home from work he is tired; his desire for rest keeps him away from his children. With this in mind, the next generation must realize what a great responsibility it assumes in raising children. The lives of the parents must be adjusted; they must be adapted to the standards of modern times. Parents and children must join hands and reveal their love for one another. Harmony in the home forges the strongest ties which keep the family together."

                "The rearing of children should consist of filling their lives with worth-while projects. Society is determined by the behavior of its citizens. The social life of today is sick, and this means that there is something wrong with the way we bring up our children. Since this type of education comes from within the family circle, we feel that the trouble lies there--thus we shall examine the relationships of family life.",
                "Present conditions have broken down family life to a certain extent. This has naturally hurt the social education of the children, and yet [the demands of]society are an essential [factor]in the lives of the parents. Without proper social education the rearing of a child is impossible. Parents must stop this neglect of social education if they want their children \nto be well-educated and refined. Good behavior is taught in very few families because the parents refuse the responsibility, and are interested only in their own enjoyment. They neglect the proper education of their family. In many cases the parents are incapable of educating their families, and in some cases the parents themselves need education.",
                "Parents must prepare themselves for their parental duties. In certain parts of the world the lives of children are so regulated that by the time they become parents they are well prepared for this task. Today we are confronted with serious problems. Instead of our children being interested in family life and preparing themselves for future marriage, entertainment, dancing, and other worldly interests take up most of their time. The activities of our children and the parents of today are certainly no credit to us. They live for worldly enjoyment and have no respect for the needs of family life. The fact that family life is degenerating should not be astonishing.",
                "The initial impetus for the decline of the family was the emancipation of women. Many women took advantage of their new liberty and thereby lost their womanly charms. Although every woman can't be a mother, every mother is a woman. So naturally the pitfalls of\"liberty\" also befell the mothers.",
                "The emancipated women became emancipated mothers who misunderstood the responsibilities of parenthood. They were led to believe that it was sufficient that they were mothers. The emancipated mother refers to marriage as a sport; she is independent of her family and her duties to her family. She becomes a slave to style and society. She loves cafes, coffee-houses, and dance halls. These are the things these mothers enjoy, not their homes and families.",
                "The emancipated woman does not care to have children; her home is no more than a place of entertainment. The emancipated woman when she becomes a mother will not discard her worldly pleasures in order to take care of her child; she hires a nursemaid or a housekeeper to raise her child. If it is a crime to neglect parental care when the child is a baby, it is a much greater crime to neglect an older child when the parents should be setting an example for the child to follow. The only parents who can raise children are those who know the realities of life from which is derived the strength necessary to raise a child properly. Among the many problems of life the problem of parenthood seems to be a natural one. The reason people see this picture in an upside-down manner is because parenthood and the sacred institution of marriage have been misrepresented.",
                "The parents who baby their children are at fault also, because the children become spoiled and selfish.",
                "There are pessimistic and optimistic parents. The optimistic parent is one who is completely satisfied with the child and is continually praising him. The pessimistic parent is one who is continually reforming the child and is very strict in his teachings; withou concern for the [natural]tendencies of the child he constantly \"drives\" him. By this method the child becomes dependent, or alienated from the parents.",
                "Many parents deal very severely with their children, scolding, beating, and ridiculing them for the least little thing. The child becomes mean and crude and resembles the parents. This is harmful to the parent also.",
                "There are parents who continually threaten, but never act--then there are those who are unsympathetic. All these parents are injurious to the welfare of family life. A child's education is made hazardous by the leniency of one parent as opposed to the strictness of the other.",
                "A great mistake is made by those parents who allow their children to taste of worldly pleasures before they are of age. The young people who are allowed this liberty, lose their self respect; they also lose what respect they had for their parents since their attitude toward life is changed.",
                "How can children respect the mothers who run around with their hair cut short, and wearing their dresses still shorter, imitating young ladies and trying to prove that they can still attract attention.",
                "Even those parents who rear their children properly at home are threatened by many harmful outside influences. One of the most dangerous of these is the company the child keeps. It will happen more than once that the child is judged by his associates. It is easy to understand the potential danger of bad company.",
                "Secular education has great effect on a child also for he learns that his parents aren't the smartest people in the world. Such knowledge does not lessen the respect he holds for his parents but increases his understanding.",
                "As the child reaches puberty with its accompanying psychological havoc, the parent is forgotten temporarily, but if sex education were properly taught the child, his respect for his parents would begin anew. At this time great care should be taken by the parents because whatever noble work may have been done can be ruined very easily with improper handling of the child.",
                "It is not enough that one is the parent of the child--one must assume the responsibilities of parenthood. Worldly riches should be set aside-children should be raised and trained for the future. Our children's virtues mean more than all the wealth of the world. These facts should be given careful thought by parents so that their lives may be regulated for the benefit of their children."

Just look at the large American movies and other shows--one can hardly find a vacant seat in them.

Soon after he left, the Hungarian-Jewish Congregation disbanded.",

In the past few years many things have been said in regards to the situation which has left the Hungarian Catholics of the North Side looking like orphans; their desire that a parish be established has never been realized. All their cries have been in vain. It is the duty of the Catholics of Chicago to find out why these people have been so neglected.

All this profitless selfishness is due to a fear that has no basis in reason.",

Of these people there are approximately thirteen thousand Catholics, and Father Soltesz has approximately four hundred of them belonging to his parish. We know that many of the people who emigrated from Hungary are German-speaking people. These German-speaking Hungarians, most of whom live on the North Side, belong to St. Michael and St. Joseph German Catholic Church; their number is approximately one thousand, so there remains approximately eleven thousand Hungarian-Catholic immigrants in Chicago without a parish. Keeping in mind the strict immigration laws of the past ten years, most of the Chicago-Hungarian immigrants, elderly folks with families and their children, are not included in the figures mentioned above. Naturally, the German-Hungarians of the North Side talk nothing but German and, therefore, as far as they are concerned, there are no Hungarian-speaking Catholics on the North Side. If Father Soltesz is not acquainted with these figures, he certainly knows of the powerful Hungarian societies that exist in that part of the city; therefore Father Soltesz cannot be working for the welfare of the Church.",
                "In the past two years Father Soltesz has refused to allow any Hungarian-Catholic priest to come into Chicago. He turned back a missionary priest sent here by the Bishop of Budapest, after which the Bishop condemned the Hungarian Catholics of America in a very critical article written in one of the daily papers, Est, in Budapest. Father Soltesz showed his hostility in the last month or so, when he openly fought against the appearance of Father Hemm, a Jesuit missionary.",
                "Father Soltesz opposed the activities of Dr. Lipot Mosonyi, who worked among the North Side Hungarians on two occasions, during which time he worked with them in order to improve their religious attitude and their general Hungarian spirit. It is this kind of a man that the North Side Hungarians want for their priest, one who unselfishly devotes his time to his own herd.",
                "But what did Father Soltesz do? He immediately started activities to stop the organization of a Hungarian-Catholic parish on the North Side. His basis for stopping these activities was that the Hungarians who lived in this district were German-speaking, and the German-Catholic churches could take these people into their fold. Father Soltesz denied religious rights to ten thousand Hungarian Catholics.",
                "It is very evident that there will not be another Hungarian-Catholic church in Chicago ,so long as Father Soltesz is here. Yet there are three Hungarian-Protestant churches here and two Hungarian-Greek Orthodox churches. Those who have eyes must see, and those who have ears must hear."

He also criticizes the Hungarian Parliament, although that institution is more than seven hundred years old. It seems that Knox must be surrounded by a lot of Czech cohorts who now, as during the war, are indoctrinating him with untrue propaganda. Arpad F. Kovacs, assistant professor of history at the University of Chicago, reminds him in the Daily News that the old Hungarian institution (the Parliament) has at least as great a value in the eyes of the Hungarians, as the Supreme Court--which is so ably and fervently defended by the Daily News--in the eyes of Knox, and that there is no need of his criticizing such an old and tried institution which all the Hungarians regard with the respect it fully deserves."

Therefore, we feel that it is our duty to discuss the resolutions passed at the national convention of the Verhovay Aid Society at Pittsburgh. [Translator's note: The Verhovay Aid Society is a national organization with about 30,000 members, of which number there are from two to five thousand members in Chicago. The Society holds a national convention once every four years.]",

The republican form of government, with the secret ballot, giving to the individual a wider field for his ambitions, is more suited to our taste.",
                "The Hapsburg dynasty--which ruled our mother country for centuries--was responsible for the fact that during its reign the Hungarians were the vassals of the feudal lords. The Hapsburg family is responsible for the dismemberment of Hungary at Trianon, and for the fact that Hungary, alone of the countries of Europe, is operated under a feudal system for the exclusive benefit of the landowners and clergy. It is the duty of all good Americans to protest against the restoration of the Hapsburgs. It is even more a duty for us, the Hungarian-born, to lift our voices against the restoration of the Hapsburg Dynasty so strongly that they will be heard all over the world and especially in Hungary. ....",
                "This was done by the convention of the Verhovay Society in August at Pittsburgh.....It was a noble gesture. It was an honest American demonstration.....",
                "The other important decision of the convention was--by a majority vote of the delegates--that hereafter any Hungarian-American may become a member regardless of his religion. This means that the Verhovay has discarded its forty-five-year-old anti-Semitic tradition, its Verhovay-Istoczy heritage of the Middle Ages, and has adopted the liberal, progressive American spirit, opening its gates to all Hungarians, including the Hungarian Jews.....",

However, the losers by this arrangement were not the Hungarian Jews..... In every American city with a large Hungarian population,there were liberal Hungarian sick benefit societies that did not raise an artificial barrier between Hungarians and Hungarians; the Hungarian Jews in America were not denied their place in the social life of their Christian countrymen. Naturally, those who have wished to become members of the great Verhovay Aid Society have their chance now.....",
                "What causes the greatest pleasure to us in this resolution is the fact that it is a moral victory, with a definite spiritual value. We are glad that the older, calmer Hungarians' way of thinking has reached this layer of Hungarian-American society. We are glad that the liberal American spirit is gaining ground.....We are glad that the ideas of Gyula Verhovay and Gyorgy Istoczy, which came in the eighties, have at last been outlawed.",
                "It is not easy for any nation's sons to come to the conclusion that in the end anti-Semitism is an evil and stupid political practice.....But to introduce anti-Semitism and make it permanent in the social life of American Hungarians is a sin. There are so few of us and we mean so little here that only unscrupulous, selfish climbers would think of disrupting our unity by advocating hatred. Anti-Semitism among the Hungarians of America means the weakening of our strength; it is against Hungarian interests.",
                "The Hungarian-American Jews have proved their love and loyalty toward our mother country.....We Hungarian-Americans of the Hebrew religion may become loyal and honest citizens of this great country, but when singing the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" and \"My Country\"--the national anthems--we include \"God Bless the Magyars\". Anyone who disturbs this unselfish and sacred sentiment with incitement to hatred on religious grounds does not deserve to be a citizen of America.",

                "And now, because the Verhovay Aid Society has put an end to this practice, we greet it with all the warmth of our hearts, and would like to wring the hand of each delegate and thank him for casting his vote for this liberal and progressive resolution.....The writer's sacred conviction is that God will bless the Verhovay Aid Society's work....."

The Hungarian-Americans have not one institution which serves the good of the public--no orphanage, no home for the aged, etc. After the foregoing assertion, the speaker assumed the role of accuser. He blamed the old country, the local Hungarian consul, the clergy, the Hungarian-American press, and the Hungarian-Americans generally. He concluded his speech with the assertion that the Hungarian-Americans cannot create anything permanent, because they lead a useless life.",
                "Undoubtedly there is a bit of truth in these assertions, because the pre-war Hungarian governments neglected the Hungarian-Americans entirely and did not even maintain contact with them. In those times Hungarians were not known as a separate national group, but were called Austro-Hungarians by the Americans.... Neverthless, the Hungarians of that time did not despair; instead, a few unselfish men, who recognized the isolation of their people, organized the Hungarian-Americans into groups. To prove that the work of these pioneers was worth while, we have institutions that are today celebrating their anniversaries of twenty, twenty-five, thirty, and thirty-five years. We are not, therefore, leading an entirely useless life.",
                "That up to the present time we have been unable to create anything permanent--as the speaker asserted--is not entirely the fault of the Hungarians, because for the past few decades the Hungarian-Americans have sacrificed much and contributed always to different Hungarian movements. Consequently, the fault must be found elsewhere.",
                "For anyone who has been attentively following the movements of the Hungarian-Americans in the past years, it is not difficult to place the blame. The battle is never lost by the troops, but by those officers who, to reap laurels for themselves, incite their men to sacrifice. Recent arrivals from Hungary cannot realize the extent of the work of the pioneers, because they find smoothly paved roads, the work of unselfish Hungarian workers. However, the leaders of national movements--in the past-were not so unselfish. The white-collar, pressed-trouser class of gentlemen--with rare exceptions--participated in these movements for personal glory, and, if obstacles arose and they were thwarted in their desire, they did not hesitate to wreck the most noble causes. Such scoundrels created a useless life here.....",
                "Thousands of dollars were taken from the Hungarian-Americans for various purposes. When, subsequently, these plans did not materialize, the hard-earned money of the contributors was never returned.....After many such experiences, is it any wonder that the Hungarian-Americans have become less gullible and less willing to make contributions?....The Hungarian-Americans today are less naive and more cautious than in the past, and they do not so readily believe nicely-phrased requests for donations. They have learned to their sorrow not to believe everything that the aristocratic leaders say....",
                "But by no means does this newly-acquired conservatism of the Hungarian-Americans mean that they are leading a useless life. It does prove, however, that they are more mature and more able to judge sanely. It is not so easy today to organize the Hungarians in the old-fashioned way that was used in the old country--coercion by the county squire with the aid of the gendarmes.",

                "p.2......................Norway was under Danish rule for a long period of time. One hundred years ago they declared their independence. Later they had a union with Sweden that is they had one king. About twenty-five years ago the Norwegian House of Representatives, the Storthing, decided to dissolve this arrangement and offered the royal crown to the younger son of the king of Denmark,thereby becoming an independent kingdom.",
                "That this didn't bring about a war between Sweden and Norway can be attributed to their king, Oscar II, who bowed to the wishes of the people and didn't try to use force.",
                "This 100th anniversary was celebrated by the Norwegians in Chicago, Friday. May 17. The first part of the celebration was held in Lincoln Park in the afternoon and at the Medinah Temple (Rush & Ontario) in the evening.",
                "The Hungarians who love liberty and are always fighting for it, have always had a sympathetic feeling toward the Norwegians. At the suggestion of our editor, the Chicago Magyar Club was represented at this occassion by a committee. They presented their congratulations in writing. The document was decorated with the Hungarian national colors. The text written by Louis K. Birinyr is as follows:",
                "\"Our highly Respected and Happy Fellow-American-Citizens of Norwegian Descent:",
                "We, the undersigned American citizens of Hungarian descent, cordially greet you on this happy occasion where you are celebrating the glorious independence of the great and good people and democratic Kingdom of Norway. We rejoice and are deeply thankful with you that we are living in and are privileged to enjoy the sacred rights and to share in the performance of the duties of the citizenship of this great and glorious democratic country of ours, wherein we are permitted to recall the greatness of our ancesters, to respect their hallowed memories and to publicly celebrate their achievements in the spheres of religious, educational, cultural, economic and political freedom and independence. We believe that there is a real and lasting American value in men and women, living in,and citizens of this, our country, who respect and honor the memories of their ancesters and are jubilant over the successes of their kins, across the ocean , in every form of honorable human advancement. Highly respected and eminently useful American citizens are they, in whose bosom burns the candle of filial love and who cherish respected solicitude for the well-being of their children's children. We,therefore, your fellow American citizens deem it an exceptionally great privilege to congratulate you for the exceedingly high and honorable human qualities which you are publicly manifesting on the occasion of your happy celebration of the independence of the people and democratic Kingdom of Norway.",
                "On this happy occasion we recall with you the supreme test to which your ancestors were subjected, when against their will they and their country, Norway, were bartered from Denmark to Sweden, merely as a pawn in the international game then played in Europe. Denmark was an ally of Napoleon and Norway was compelled to pay the price. The Treaty of Kiel (January 1814) was forced upon the Norwegian people, and therein they were robbed of their right of self-determination, their liberty and independence. Against her will Norway was ceded to Sweden. But your ancestors vigorously protested and so successfully resisted the unholy attempt to deprive them of their liberty and independence that on May 17, 1814, they elected a king of their own, adopted a liberal constitution, established a Norwegian Parliament and gave notice to the whole world that Norway thenceforth shall be a free and independent kingdom. But the God-given right of the people of Norway to liberty and independence was disputed. A war followed between Sweden and Norway. The liberty-loving people of Norway were victorious. The great Powers of Europe, however, intervened and Norway was forced against her will into an unnatural union with Sweden. They never consented to the loss of their liberty and independence and on June 7, 1905 the Norwegian Parliament declared unanimously that the union with Sweden under one king has ceased. Ever since, Norway is free and independent.",
                "While we partake in your joy and unite with you in your celebration of the independence of Norway, our thoughts are naturally directed to unfortunate, inhumanly mutilated and cruelly crucified Hungary, the land of our ancestors. For one-thousand years past, Hungary was the rear guard of European Christian civilization. Time after time, the Hungarians fought, bled and died to protect Western Europe and her Christian civilization from the invasion of the East, - the Mongols and the Turks. History has given the Hungarian people the title,\"Defenders and Protectors of Christianity and Christian Civilization.\" Even in this age, the bells in the towers of Christian churches toll each noon the message that on July 21, 1456, the Hungarians, led by John Hunyadi, delivered the final blow to the Turks and settled once and for all time to come the freedom of Western Europe from Turkish invasion.",
                "We proudly recall that the Hungarians were always a liberty-loving people. Originally, Hungary was an independent kingdom and she was the first country in continental Europe to have a constitution (1222), the English Magna Charta preceding it only by seven years. We are proud that it was in Hungary, for the first time in Europe a law was enacted, which gave freedom of religion and liberty of conscience to all inhabitants of Hungary.",
                "The constant struggle of the Hungarian people against invasion weakened them and subsequently they fell under the control of the Hapsburg dynasty of Austria and there they remained against their will until after the termination of the World War,",
                "At the out break of the World War, Hungary had no international will of her own. Her will was subjected to that of the Hapsburg dynasty of Austria. In turn the Hapsburg dynasty was under the control of its Austrian, Czech, Polish and Slavic leaders.",
                "It is now a matter of open historical knowledge that of all the European countries involved in the World War, Hungary was the only one that earnestly and vigorously opposed the provocation and outbreak of the World War; yet she was forced into it and was ordered to fight although she had no appreciable interest in the outcome of the World War. Yet, after the termination of the World War, an unprecedentedly cruel punishment was meted out to Hungary. In the Treaty of Trianon more than two-thirds of her population were taken from her. The perfect territorial integrity and economic unity of Hungary were most cruelly violated; her commerce and industry were ruined; her people - ten millions of them - with more than two-thirds of her territory were given over to foreign control of much less civilization. Her remaining eight million people were reduced to unheard of suffering and privations. Cut off the head, amputate the arms and limbs of a human being, take out his lungs, cut the cord of his heart and then tell him to live - then you will have a correct conception of what was done to Hungary in the unholy Treaty of Trianon.",
                "As the result of the Treaty of Trianon, Hungary is slowly bleeding to death. A great people, who have given so much to the world, who have contributed so much to the advancement of civilization, have been condemed to slow starvation and eventual death.",
                "While you, our happy fellow American citizens of Norwegian descent,happily celebrate the rebirth of Norway, we, American citizens of Hungarian descent,are earnestly pleading with civilized mankind for justice,a fair deal,and renewed life for Hungary.\"",

Chicago is our home, and the significance of the World's Fair is appreciated by the residents as well as by the city.",
                "We wish to advise the Chicago Hungarian participants that they should not overestimate their ability as they have done in the past. The manufacturing, commercial and cultural attainments of Hungary can best be exhibited by the Hungarian government. It has, no doubt, already made an appropriation for this purpose, and since this will be quite an important Hungarian undertaking, the Hungarian government will send its own representatives over here to arrange its exhibit.",
                "Chicago Hungarians are an integral part of the population of this city. They can show what they have produced and how far they have progressed in the last century. The manner in which we will show our accomplishments will be the task of the Hungarian committee to discover. We do not believe that we should promise, either in the American press or elsewhere, great or impossible things and in the end exhibit a smoky Csarda (inn or tavern), with a few gypsies and a few Hungarian-costumed couples dancing the Csardas, as representative of the accomplishments of Chicago Hungarians.",
                "In all probability, as was done at other fairs, a day will be assigned to each national group. To prepare for this one day is the most important duty of the Chicago Hungarian group. We offer a modest suggestion to the Hungarian committee. Hungarian music and song would be the most effective contribution of our group. Five years is ample time to train a good chorus and a Hungarian symphony orchestra.....",
                "As this great movement is neither political nor religious, let us add that everyone should be asked to take part. All the churches, political, social, cultural, and sick benefit organizations should unite in an effort to produce something worthwhile...."

That most Hungarians and other foreigners--even natives--do not know the basic difference between these two parties is not the greatest misfortune. In local and state elections it is usually the minority against the majority, the criticism of those in power by the opposition.",

Both parties are fond of the voters, but neither party has any use for the citizen, who is changeable.....",

We know well that the Hungarians of Chicago dance and make merry on the corner of Halsted Street and North Avenue, and this is where the Hungarian girl of gypsy blood and \"Antal Sebok,\" the leading characters of the story, get acquainted. This is not the phantasy of the author. Edna Ferber writes the truth.",

In Budapest, we can brag about our cultural superiority, much to the disgust of the Balkan nations, because there is sufficient ground for it. But here in Chicago we cannot boast, because without the support of famous names from across the ocean such boasting sounds fantastic.....",

It is futile to say at this date that the feudal system of Hungary is responsible for this condition. At best this will ease our consciences only temporarily.

I believe that the Hungarian businessmen of Chicago have contributed their share in an effort to maintain this theater on a permanent basis.",
                "However, we find it unpleasant when, on every occasion, Mr. Ignac Izsak delivers a lecture about [i.e. criticizing]the businessmen. He has no reason to do this. Chicago's Hungarian businessmen have always done their duty in public affairs. It is not their fault that plans for a Magyar Home have failed. The Magyar Home of Burnside was not built by businessmen, but by the thousands of members of the Virgin Mary Society. If there were such a group on the North Side, we too would probably have a Magyar Home, but here each organization segregates itself and there is no co-operation.",
                "There are no Hungarian businessmen on the North Side who make a living from Hungarians only. If they have Hungarian customers, they give one hundred cents value for every dollar spent. Those who deal only with Hungarians can afford to contribute much more toward such a cause, because for them it is an investment that will draw interest eventually.",
                "I believe that if all the Hungarian businessmen were to turn over to the fund all the profits made from transactions with Hungarian customers, they still would not have enough money to build a Magyar Home. When the societies on the North Side did want to raise money for a Magyar Home, then was the time for Mr. Izsak to make speeches and boost this proposed undertaking. But at that time, Mr. Izsak was not enthusiastic. Now that the building and financing of one Magyar Home has been successful, Mr. Izsak wants another one and is prompting the Hungarians [to act]and accusing the businessmen.",
                "We are all willing to listen to Mr. Izsak's speeches about Hungarian politics, because anyone may have political views, but many of the Hungarian businessmen object to being made the butt of his recriminations. In the event that the societies on the North Side will agree on their desire to build a Magyar Home, Mr. Izsak may rest assured that we Hungarian businessmen will not shirk our duty. In the meanwhile, we ask Mr. Izsak not to try to cause dissension between the businessmen and the people, but to use his efforts to unite all classes, so that we may all work together for the same end."

                "It is gratifying to find among our contemporaries writers of such intelligent, fairminded, and frank editorials as the one which appeared in the New York World. No doubt, the wise and courageous policy of its great editor, Joseph Pulitzer, now deceased, is not dead yet. The Hungarians in this country, as well as abroad, will notice that the powerful moulder of American public opinion, the world, has diagnosed the Hungarian governmental situation very precisely and correctly, and all the agents and hirelings of the Horthy regime, whether they are Americans like Mr. Menken or Hungarians, cannot mislead the intelligent Americans.",
                "As much as we deplore the officiousness of the Security League by annoying Countess Karolyi upon her entrance to America, we consider it as a great publicity stunt to her American mission. While we are convinced that her political convictions are anti-Bolsheviki, her lectures will prove beyond doubt the nature and character of her American mission, and the great and glorious type of Hungarian womanhood Countess Karolyi represents.",
                "If Countess Karolyi's American visit would be the very least injurious to the genuine American spirit, or to our American free and liberal institution we would ourselves favor her deportation, as we do not like to see Hungarians knocking our adopted country and hurting the reputation of all of us, but we warmly welcome Countess Karolyi as a true representative of Hungarian democracy, and the finest prototype of Hungarian womanhood, a rare specimen among the aristocracy of old Hungary.",
                "We heartily congratulate the New York World for their editorial. In the vernacular of the day: The World said a mouthful. Let the Horthy regime and their faithful ally, Stanwood Menken, put this in their pipe and smoke it."

It was from this undivided enthusiasm that the different Hungarian activities were brought forth in this city and throughout the country.",
                "Now this new life-giving stream is going to stop, because from now on there will be very few new Hungarians coming to this city and to other cities throughout the country. We are left alone just as we were during the World War.",

We can't credit all this activity to the Hungarian people, because it was an outside source that created this activity; it was the unavoidable influence of the World War.",

These heavy and sorrowful facts must be rectified and ways and means must be found in order that the social life of the Hungarian people may be straightened out.

                "Usually church life is directed from other sources besides the local church; often they are helped out financially so that their existence may be assured, so naturally each Saint's hand is closest to his own pocket, and so each church thinks of its own members first, and this membership is the majority. But then there are those who are outside of the church, it seems as though the remaining few will be so neglected that in time they will even lose the Hungarian language.",

In view of this we are submitting the following program which we think will help bring back this needed strength:",

Naturally, it will be rather unusual, after getting used to the Austro - Hungarian consulate, to establish one purely Hungarian, but we will get used to it. The main thing is that the new Magyar consulate will not assume the superior lordly air, and bureaucratic spirit of the old one.",
                "The old unhappy spirit, along with the unhappy old relations with Austria, was wiped out by the War; therefore, we should not be concerned with the past, but look ahead to the future.",
                "We hope that everybody has learned by the errors of the past and that the new consuls will bring the spirit of the new times with them. The consuls are chiefly commercial representatives and as such they will be of great significance of Chicago, which is an important market as well as a railroad and industrial center.",
                "A clever consul can render great services to crippled Hungarian commerce, and give an impulse to Hungarian industrial life. An expert consul can improve business between the United States and Hungary.",
                "We know from the past that the Hungarian consulates, as commercial representatives, were of very little service in this respect, since their activities were chiefly directed to settle some more or less difficult affairs of Hungarian subjects. Most of the complaints originated on that account, and we expect some improvement along this line.",
                "Because we serve the same public as the Hungarian consulate will serve, our range of interest is closely related to that of the Consulate. We promise that as long as the Hungarian consulate serves the interests of the Hungarian subjects living here and the interests of the United States citizens of Hungarian descent, with loyalty, love, punctuality, and sincerity, the consulate can always count on our support, without expecting any compensation or acknowledgement in return.",
                "This we sincerely promise partly in the interest of our unlucky country and partly for the sake of our Magyar brothers living here. But be it known too, that we (our newspaper) will be no lackey, cover for crime, or a household newspaper for the consulate.",
                "We will preserve our independence under every circumstance. Our independence, first and last, belongs to the Magyars, and it is not for sale. We will be brave and open enemies of consular grafters. We shall constantly and relentlessly expose any bad tendencies of the consulate and we will put a stop to the continuation of any condition of this nature with all our strength.",

                "The main purpose of the future consuls should be to attain popularity and to be liked by all not only by the Magyar people, but by the Americans as well.",
                "World changes have put the Hungarian consulates in a new situation, investing them with an entirely new mission.",
                "Besides their regular duties, they have to take part in the affairs of the Magyars, not in a lordly manner, but so as to cooperate with them on a Democratic basis.",
                "The support, self - sacrifice, and patriotic sentiment of the American Magyars towards their suffering native country is of great importance and should be sustained and augmented by the consulates. In Chicago a great and difficult task awaits the consulate in this respect, not because the Magyars of Chicago refuse to perform their duty to their native country, but because Chicago Magyar social life is in a period of dullness. Magyar social life in Chicago is desolate, inactive, barren, and quiet.",
                "We cannot let conditions stand as they are now. American Magyar social activities must be given new life and made friutful, and every meeting of Magyar societies and organizations should strive toward this end. And here is where the consulate faces its great and difficult task.",
                "Besides, as it is known to all of us, Chicago is the stronghold of the pan - Slavic movement in America, and the anti - Magyar movement of the Czechs, Yugoslavs, and Slovaks spread out from Chicago. We have to consider too that the newly born Czechoslovakia has very strong supporters and loyal adherents in Chicago.",
                "Consequently, we have to face these anti - Magyar movements, which means that we have to develop a Magyar irredentism movement.",
                "We believe that the Magyar leaders, regardless of whether they are Hungarian subjects or American Magyar citizens, will receive the consuls with warm friendship and they will help them in their work where it is possible and permissible. It depends on the consuls, whether they want to cultivate this friendship or let it cool off as before.",
                "As long as the consulates cooperate with Magyar brotherly sentiment, their work will be successful because the American Magyars, and especially the leaders of the Chicago Magyars, are always ready to work for the interest of the native country. But we will not allow anyone to treat us with scorn, arrogance, or snobbishness."

We have tried to arouse the feeling of the Chicago-Hungarians in every way possible. We have employed all the editorial schemes a newspaper is permitted to use in order to picture the terrible conditions abroad, and have explained the methods to relieve the conditions. To a certain extent, we have been successful. We have heard from a number of patriotic Hungarians who are willing to do their part in this behalf. We are trying to organize a society that will be in harmony with and conform to its ideals as has been done in other cities. At this time we are about ready to launch such an organization. Information has come to us that even those Hungarians who are not numbered among our readers have advised us of their intention to help feed the thousands of little children in Hungary in order that they may be saved. This fact has given us great encouragement. There is, however, one discouraging feature connected with this worthy movement. These prospective helpers will support our society providing we concede to some of their wishes. If they can be the leaders and we are the followers, if we are the contributors, and they are the donors, then all will be well. These people have been connected with organizations of this kind before, but this being a free and democratic country, and the majority of Hungarians being a democratic and freedom-loving people, such organizations have always failed.",
                "These self-styled leaders may think what ever they please of our group as a class. Today, this class is not a bunch of sheep following a bellwether. We are very particular whom we follow and whom we choose to represent us, and, in our opinion, this class of people has always been the backbone of all Hungarian organizations.",
                "As we understand it, the heart of every Hungarian has been deeply touched by the plight of those starving Hungarian children, but his heart will respond only if he can be the collector, if he can be the leader, if he can be the boss, and we, the working Hungarians become the contributors, and his obedient servants.",
                "Let us say right here and now that we have no objections to the character, integrity and ability of Mr. Joseph Byfield and to his associates. They may be conscientious men. We are glad to have them associated with us and take an interest in the affairs of the Hungarian community. But we do object to the un-American methods Mr. Byfield and his associates are using to obtain leadership and control of legitimate Hungarian movements in Chicago. We want to remind our readers that it was Mr. Byfield and his friends who took charge of The Hungarian Patriotic Association which, after operating a short time, was forced to disband. \"Too many midwives, and the baby will die,\" says an old Hungarian proverb. There are no successful organizations in which everyone is a leader, but Mr. Byfield and his friends want to be nothing short of officials in all Hungarian movements. We sincerely admire their ambitions!",

We admire these men because they wish to be affiliated with our race, despite the fact these men rank very high socially in American society. What hurts us is that when these distinguished Hungarian gentlemen become heads or are officers of our organizations, about 45,000 Hungarians in Chicago become estranged from that very movement. This is not our personal opinion, but are the facts obtained from past experiences which have led us to form this deplorable conclusion and honest conviction.",
                "Our interest in this movement, as well as in any Hungarian movement, which will benefit the Hungarians of Chicago, is impartial. We feel that it is our duty as public servants to voice our opinion against these cliques whose methods are of a disadvantage to Hungarian traditions and public life.",
                "We hope Mr. Byfield and his friends have the 100,000 distressed Hungarian children in mind rather than the publicity that they might get out of the movement. We want them to be generous this time, not for our sake, not for the sake of democracy, but for the sake of the future Hungarian generation, whose fate rests with all of us.",
                "Let the Hungarian people of Chicago elect leaders whom they believe will lead them to the greatest success. We feel that the Chicago-Hungarians are intelligent enough to pick desirable and worthy men and women as their representatives.",
                "This has been done in all cities and localities where Hungarians live. If this is done the right way, the work and the responsibility is shouldered equally by all. We believe that every one is aware of the fact that we live in a democratic country, and so we want to follow the principles of that form of government.",
                "We hope that no one is offended by this article, that is not our intention. We also hope that it will not close the pocketbooks of those who are willing and able to contribute towards this noble cause. We repeat, we are ready to support this movement with all our power, but we do not want to sacrifice the great principle for which we have been fighting so earnestly and that which almost upset the whole world in the past five years. That great principle is this; no one has a monopoly over the Hungarians. No one can dictate to us. The people have their rights and we are for the rights of the people.",

                "The excellent Hungarian newspaper, the Egyetertes (Concord) of New York, published a very interesting article on American bank failures. The article was prompted by the fact that last week several New York banks closed their doors, in particular the bank established by John Nemeth which was later called the American Union Bank. Many Hungarian families had their life savings in this Hungarian bank.",
                "We Chicagoans are no longer afflicted with this contagious disease of bank failures. At least, we believe this is the case. Because last spring this plague ruthlessly took its toll in our midst and we could not offer calm advice while nerves were taut and feelings at fever pitch, we waited until the present time when people have become more or less accustomed to the situation. We give our opinion now because we are not satisfied with the view taken by the editor of the Egyetertes.",
                "For example, the first conclusion of the Egyetertes is the following:",
                "\"When a bank fails, the loser is not the banker but the thousands of depositors. The bank itself is only a depository, the handler of the money. The real losers, therefore, are the depositors.\"",
                "The foregoing comment is either a faulty conception or a malicious misrepresentation. We believe that the Egyetertes based its conclusion on erroneous information. In our opinion the biggest loser is the bank, which loses its prestige when its doors are closed by state authorities. The bank is then completely ruined. It loses the faith of its depositors, and its capital is in imminent danger. Moreover, the directors and stockholders of the bank face a critical and dark future. The stockholders may lose their invested capital and also be held responsible for the stock in their possession at the time the bank becomes insolvent. The directors, on the other hand, lose their invested capital; and, according to state and federal laws, they are faced with double liability for the stock in their possession...Therefore, their wealth is gone and their source of income is cut off. They add to the number of unemployed. This happens if there is no criminal liability involved and if everything was aboveboard and within the law when the bank failed. If the directors of the bank are found guilty of embezzlement or mishandling of funds, thereby violating the banking laws, dire punishment--the darkness of the penitentiary--awaits them. This happened to officials of the New York Bank of the United States and this fate awaits some of the officials of Chicago's closed banks. In other words, the owners and directors lose at least as much as the depositors. Let no one be under the impression that only the depositors are the losers. In such an economic upheaval as that which is sweeping the world, it is a wonder that any small bank can remain open. We see century-old European banking institutions wavering like the leaves of the poplar tree in a storm.",
                "In America the only big bank catastrophe was the failure of the Bank of the United States. The other 560 bank failures were only comparatively disastrous. According to the prevailing American view, the really large banks withstood the tempest, and the failure of the smaller banks was due to the economic depression which ruined farmers and property owners. The depositors deserve our deepest sympathy in the economic catastrophe; and without a doubt, more stringent state and federal laws are needed to put a stop to this contagion of bank failures.",
                "On the other hand, the depositors had a fair share in the failure of the smaller banks. There isn't a bank in the world which is strong enough to withstand a run in which from ninety to a hundred per cent of its depositors demand all their money.....Even the German National Bank could not withstand such a run, although its capital was much larger than that of any of the American banks which failed. Naturally the depositor has a right to withdraw his hard-earned savings from the bank. However, when thousands demand their money at once, it is unfair to the bank. With this act the depositors announce that their faith in the bank is gone. The bank having capitalized on the faith of its depositors, placed the money into interest-bearing securities and kept on hand only fifteen to twenty per cent of the cash deposits. Therefore, the bank can return only fifteen or twenty per cent of the total deposits on immediate demand. The other depositors must either wait or report the insolvency of the bank, which means the failure of the bank and even greater danger to the deposits. When a bank fails in prosperous times, we immediately suspect the directors, but in such panicky times as the present, mass hysteria and economic paralysis are the basic reasons.....In summary, this is our opinion of bank failures.....",
                "The other question is: What to do?",
                "\"This is a very serious question [writes the Egyetertes] and we are taking a great deal of responsibility upon ourselves when we endeavor to answer it.

If it is safe at home from burglars and thieves, then that is the proper place for it--especially until the economic crisis blows over--because the thought of waking someday to the knowledge that our life savings are gone must be a terrible feeling. In a moment our hard-earned money is no more--a consequence of the unscrupulousness of some banker. We cannot even hope to begin saving anew, because time has flown away and we are old.",

This is considered a crime punishable with imprisonment.....Even if it were permissible, it would not be fair. Just imagine what would happen if all American and foreign-language newspapers advised their readers to withdraw their deposits from the bank for the duration of the economic depression. Immediately the number of unemployed would be tripled and commerce would be paralyzed.....This advice is bad. It would induce a revolution.....We believe that no large amount of cash should be kept at home.",

If there is anyone who does not know how to invest his money he should ask some one who is familiar with the question and who is also honest and reliable. In case of illness we consult a physician; in time of trouble--a lawyer; when building--an architect; and when investing, we ask the advice of a reliable banking institution. In every phase of our life there is risk. This is true in investments, too, but still the risk is minimized when we deal with a good banking institution.....If anyone wishes to make the economic crisis even more serious, he will advise the reader to take his money from the bank and keep it at home. We believe the Egyetertes, which is a conservative newspaper, never intended to be an instrument of radical ideals and will correct the false impression which its articles created.",

As he was about to leave the museum, his son became so interested in the different mechanical exhibits that he [Rosenwald] had to take the youngster back several times before the latter would consent to visit other places. Rosenwald decided that a museum such as this would be interesting to young and old alike, and so we in Chicago are fortunate."

                "Recently, your paper published an article regarding the Cooperative Society of America and its functions. In reply to this, I would like to make some additions.",
                "Since its organization two years ago, we have waged battles against price increases in such a manner as to make purchases directly from the growers. In this way, we avoided the profits of the middleman and other charges. Six thousand members with one hundred twenty-three businesses enjoy the better quality of goods at cheaper prices received through the society. After all, the consumers should be satisfied. The consumer is as much entitled to the savings as he is to quality.",
                "If all things, such as labor and taxes, are taken into consideration prices should be lower, because as allied growers, all their products are produced on their own grounds. As a matter of fact, the steel mills manufacture their requirements on their own grounds, and they do not try to cut down taxes. They try to please the workers, and therefore, get better results.",
                "To help business conditions in Chicago, five million dollars was offered as a loan for building construction. Steps are being taken to accept this offer.",
                "In other words, the Society is always on the lookout to provide work and decent homes in Chicago. Action is most important, and not too much talk.",
                "If you wish to know of more details, Mr. Editor, or any reader, please forward your inquiries with complete confidence to the Foreign department, Room 928, Consumer's Building, Chicago, Illinois.",

                "For four years our members have been suffering the ravages of the crisis. Like all other immigrant groups, we, too, are stricken by universal unemployment, lack of money, loss of our homes, farms, and savings and have to face the sinister ogre of a prospectless future,and a sad old age.",
                "This crisis has shaken up the foundations of even the biggest institutions. It was only the generous help extended by the government which averted the collapse of several insurance companies. If these giants with their hundreds of millions have been shaken, it is no wonder if the smaller associations find themselves thrown about like so many shells on the stormy sea of the present crisis.",
                "The devaluation of bonds, the loss of savings, the advance in years of our members, not to mention unemployment, are setting almost unsolvable problems before our associations.",
                "In spite of loans and of postponements granted our members to pay their dues, the number of those who have ceased to be our members or who are about to lose their membership amounts to several thousands. As there exists no other social security, these members lose their sole support in case of sickness or death. What will become of our associations, whose future was already gloomy enough in consequence of the closing of immigration? Is there any solution in this crisis, is there any other outlet besides the one of striking unemployed members off our rolls?",
                "Yes, there is, if we all look together for it. Just as the small home owners and farmers, so can the members of our associations expect help from the government, provided a mass movement is set in motion to support this action. Just as the members of the associations of other nationalities, so have we Hungarians the right and duty to combine to protect our interests.",
                "We have the right to expect from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which has aided the insurance companies and American lodges with hundreds of millions, to come to the aid of our Hungarian associations too. This, together with the foundation of branches for joint medical care, hospitalization, sanatoriums, and through creation of unemployment funds in our associations, besides other needed steps, will enable us to keep all our members and thus save our associations from disaster.",
                "At the same time we have to take a stand on the question of social security by the State. It is the duty of society, in the first place, to care for the unemployed and for those who are unable to support themselves on account of old age, physical disability, or any other reason. The Hungarian associations too, have to demand aid for the poor, the distribution thereof to be made through them.",
                "Besides the ever increasing misery, there is another dark cloud hanging over us--the swiftly approaching cloud of war. With cries for new markets and for and against revision of treaties, war is getting under way--a war of which the workers and the little man will be the victims again, just as in 1914-18. With war will come the rise of Fascism and other isms. Hitler and the Fascists are shedding the blood of those who refuse to bend before them-- the workers, the people of the middle class, and the Jews. We have to do something against the ever increasing danger of war and Fascism.",
                "These conditions are not exclusively European. We the immigrants have felt them heavily here in America too. Discrimination against immigrants is found in the shop, in the distribution of relief, and in proposals of patriotic organizations and politicans of America, that demand their registration, fingerprinting, and deportation.",
                "Is there any way to defend ourselves against all this? Certainly, there is! If we get organized and join forces with the American workers, farmers, and little man, then we, too, can expect results. It is high time for our hundreds of thousands of Hungarians to unite for the defense of their common interests. Let us put aside our petty old differences and, with joined forces, seek a way out.",
                "The undersigned Hungarian-Americans, though belonging to different organizations are ready to act jointly, and are calling all leaders of societies--sick benefit, church, workers', cultural, sport, singing, amateur, etc., as well as inter-association committees and national and district leaders--to send their delegates to the meetings of the Hungarian-American Associations to be held on June 23, 24, and 25 at the Hungarian Home in Chicago.",
                "The meeting will begin Friday, June 23, at three o'clock in the afternoon. The meeting on Friday evening will be open to the public. Saturday evening is reserved for the guests to see the World's Fair.",
                "Come to Chicago for those days to seek salvation for our institutions and to join our forces for that purpose. Those wishing to participate should report their intention to the Central Bureau of the Committee for Preparation, 458 West North Avenue, Chicago, Illinois.",

The hoarded billions derived from mass production were not redistributed fairly among the people because the machinery owners did not allow it, and, as a result, the wheels of the machinery stopped. And no genius of the capitalistic social order can make the wheels go until it is acknowledged that the system must be changed.",

The only thing Hoover failed to think of is where the unemployed will get their next meal.....",

The citizens have not been altogether disappointed in Roosevelt.....He advocates raising the taxes on the rich by fifty per cent. If our government would follow this example, every needy person could be taken care of.....",
                "After these healthy recommendations, Roosevelt also deviated from the path of sanity. Because he is campaigning for the presidency, he assured the capitalists that they need not be afraid of drastic action if he becomes the next tenant of the White House.",
                "Roosevelt lied when he said that the unemployed would be given work. Men on relief are ordered to parks and roads, where they idle away the time in superfluous work. Real work will not be given the reliefers; the contractors will get the real work so that our politicians can have their graft.....",

If it were not so, if normal, intelligent, sane, conscious American citizens were suffering hardships in this land of milk and honey, such remedies as work relief could not be offered.",

                "Martin Himler is one of the brainiest journalists in Magyar America, and his article--which can be found on another page in this issue--deserves to be read attentively and that we should discuss it in this editorial. The topic of which he writes is extremely important and an actuality in all of our lives.",
                "Naturally, the publishing of the article does not mean that we agree one hundred per cent with its point of view and that we accept its analysis. We respect Himler's sincere and brave words, we applaud his sense of social justice, but he colors his conclusions with pessimistic hues and views the future in dark colors. Even concrete facts and events can be easily interpreted in several ways, and prophecies or presentiments can be presented from an individual point of view by an adept journalist.",
                "Let us comment on the present economic crisis and on Martin Himler's question \"When Will There Be Work?\" from our angle.",
                "Evidently, the past two months and the next two months will see the depth, the bottom of this economic depression. In a few years, a more accurate description will be given by the economic barometer. Probably the all-time low will be in December 1930.",
                "But when we live in an era of crisis, the doubters, the pessimists, and the shortsighted fall into deep despair; they prophesy utter ruin....they attempt revolution, moan and think of the worst.",
                "This is the time when sanity, cold calculation, ability to face the future, discipline, and a thorough weighing of consequences and possibilities are necessary.",
                "Extreme optimism, foolish hopes, the belief in sure success are unfortunate and dangerous. A calm weighing of the past, investigating facts circumspectly and, of the two magnified possibilities choosing the middle course, will in all probability lead us in the right direction.",
                "In the present serious crisis, too, we can draw our conclusions for the future from two outstanding important circumstances. We accept Martin Himler's assertion (although we think he exaggerates) that capital is the unlimited master of society and countries. Capital is usually represented by banks, financial institutions, and the stock markets. It is also generally known that in the stock markets and in financial institutions, the depression is felt to a dangerous degree. Naturally, this is an artificial, manufactured result--smart tactics on the part of big capital.....",
                "Although this is despicably unjust from the viewpoint of the ordinary citizen or the worker, the fact is that this is the method of manipulation of big capital. This is their cure for the seriously ill society....",
                "It is purely a matter of time--we can say a relatively short time--when capital will become active again and will bring circulation back by degrees to rigid economic life....",
                "The greatest commercial and industrial concerns of America--in other words, capital--are gravitating toward gradual industrial democracy and even persuade the workers to buy stocks under favorable conditions.",
                "This is a clever and purposeful tactic. Through democracy, men and women are invested with political rights which gradually will bring about the more equal distribution of wealth....",
                "It is the stupidity, indifference, and inertia of the voters that is at fault in the slow progress of a more equal distribution of wealth.",
                "However, no one should think that those billions of dollars lying idle in banks, financial institutions, and industry will remain so for long or that the generals of big capital will allow unemployment and business depression to persist without doing anything about it.",
                "The most simple-minded man, with an elementary education, knows that this unemployment situation--the starving people of Arkansas, Oklahoma, Chicago, and New York--is the most fertile soil and the best opening for fanatical experimentation and the outbreak of hostilities on the part of the dissatisfied population.",
                "But American capital does not want this to happen. American capital will not commit suicide. Its past of a hundred years proves the contrary. Just as it will provide food, clothing, and housing, it will provide employment too.",
                "At this time capital is gathering strength for a new era. It needs this lengthy rest.....",
                "Already two important symptoms are apparent which foretell the end of the crisis.....As we have been suffering from the depression for a year and a half, a quick recovery is not anticipated, and employment will not be available for millions of people this year. The beginning of employment for all will be gradual and will start in the most vital branches of industry.",
                "We believe that the number of the unemployed will diminish this spring, but within a year or two, in 1932, the number of the unemployed will be at normal, and even if we will not have loud-noised prosperity, we will have enough opportunities for work.",
                "In such a powerful industrial and farming country as the United States, where machinery causes such drastic changes every year for industrial workers and farmers alike, there is bound to be and there always is a great number of unemployed.....",
                "Undoubtedly, there are several weighty problems unsolved and these retard economic prosperity, but we do not believe that the American citizens will consider applying the teachings of Marx to their troubles or will make an issue of this at the next election.",
                "For oratorical effect the injustice of the unequal distribution of wealth will often be heard in campaign speeches because it is a sore spot to all of us. Nevertheless, we think that less radical thoughts will be upper-most in the minds of the voters when they have recuperated from the effects of this depression. They will again dream of six- or eight-cylinder automobiles and will discuss Prohibition. This is our conception of the future!.....",
                "We would like to dwell briefly on the fact that although the philosophy and physiology of capital is identical internationally, its tactics, methods, and instruments differ. In England and in Germany, capital has to contend with problems different from those in America.....",
                "America is not independent of international problems, but neither is it wholly dependent upon them. Although it would be very important and profitable that peace and order prevail in other parts of the world, to put at least half of our five million unemployed to work the internal problems of the United States have to be remedied gradually, with the timely co-operation of big capital only. Neither England nor Germany could do this.",
                "Our conclusion is that in time external problems will be solved either peacefully or otherwise, and this will have a beneficial effect on the American economic situation.",
                "Our internal economic problems are nearing solution, and although we do not believe that this solution will be ideal and perfect, it will bring another ten years of happy times, when those who are willing to work will have employment and will not have to loiter in the streets in despair to beg for bread, lodging, and fuel. By virtue of reasonable wages, a livelihood and some measure of comfort will be assured the majority of the workers, just as in the so-called good old times, under the old imperfect order.",
                "We are not writing the foregoing to present the facts through rose-colored glasses, but it is an attempt to show the right way on the basis of our observations and analysis."

In view of the increasing number of the unemployed, the question arises: How will America take care of its impoverished, ragged, and physically and mentally exhausted army of unemployed that make up the bread lines?",
                "Since it is an undeniable fact that this so-called industrial depression found this country unprepared, the gigantic task of solving the problem of unemployment confronted the nation out of a clear sky. Even in normal times there is misery and poverty among some people of a great country, and there are many institutions and agencies which are busy taking care of these. However, the present crisis found social and governmental organizations totally unprepared to cope with the problem.",

Shortening the working hours and the working week, as well as lowering food prices, was proposed.",
                "In view of the fact that in most instances the American citizen is given preference over the foreign-born in gaining employment or at public works, the immigrants feel the weight of the industrial depression in even a greater degree. Many foreign-language organizations realized this and have tried to keep their unemployed members, but unfortunately few foreign-language organizations are in a postion to remedy the distress of the immigrants. The Foreign Language Information Service advises that the foreign-language organizations should work together hand in hand with American organizations. To this effect the F. L. I. S. sent out three hundred circular letters to foreign-language organizations, in which it asks for data about their financial status, methods, and possible co-operation with American organizations. The F. L. I. S. also wishes to ascertain the number of immigrants discharged from employment because of their nationality or lack of naturalization papers, and the number of unemployed members in each organization. By securing such data, the F. L. I. S. hopes to bring action in behalf of the foreign-speaking and foreign-born population."

The number of people supported by charity--not because they are infirm in any way but because they are unemployed--reached the staggering number of fifty million in civilized countries. Fifty million persons who would like to work but cannot find employment are compelled to beg. What will the outcome of this be? In a year, if conditions do not improve, the number of unemployed may reach one hundred million, and many who are aiding others today will be beggars tomorrow.

                "In the first place, there are those who have not been in this country very long and, therefore, they have not established themselves in industry, due to their lack of sufficient service; there are those who belong in the common laboring class, those who do not have a trade of any kind; then there are those who have little or no ambition and naturally are not wanted by industry.",
                "It is an absolute fact that there are thousands of Hungarians in Chicago who are unemployed and who are going hungry.",
                "After these unfortunate, breadless Hungarians have gone to the limit of their credit, which does not take long, they then are left destitute, common beggars.",
                "Can you visualize what a terrible situation it is, when an absolutely normal person must resort to begging in a foreign country? This fact is not imaginary because the Hungarian beggar has already made his appearance in the United States.",
                "Those who came here to the land of wealth have been cheated, and now, with bowed heads they visit Hungarian homes and beg. This is a very bitter situation, but it is not new.",
                "We older Americans know that before the war the Hungarian beggar visited Hungarian families and Hungarian organizations. Who can tell us how many letters asking for aid were received by Hungarian organizations and Hungarian businessmen of this city?",
                "Years ago, when economic conditions became bad and unemployment resulted, the Hungarian beggar appeared. In the past this movement was so great that some of the common beggars became regular professional beggars. There were those who regarded begging as a regular business: they worked the Hungarian districts of the cities from New York to San Francisco, with letters of recommendation, many of these letlers written under fictitious names. They begged from individuals as well as from Hungarian organizations.",
                "The war put a stop to this detrimental business of begging.",
                "The never-ceasing begging that took place before the war was so great that those Hungarians who were financially able organized lodges and societies to care for this situation. The main idea of these organizations was to see that those deserving aid received it.",
                "The members of these organizations did not receive any benefits; all they did was donate. These benevolent organizations existed in New York, Chicago, and Cleveland. The Chicago Hungarian Charitable Society was famous throughout the nation. This organization was highly respected and favored for the honest and indiscriminating work it performed.",
                "The Chicago Hungarian Charitable Society, after almost fifty years of active existence, disbanded during the war. There weren't enough needy people in this rich land of ours; therefore, there was no field for the society to work in. From the organization mentioned above, the Hungarian Charitable Ladies Society was formed. This Society centers its activities around cultural and social movements. Even today they are doing some wonderful work in their own exclusive circle.",
                "But the original aim of the Chicago Hungarian Charitable Society is lacking; even among its members the ever-increasing American ideas can be felt, although the membership consists of a large number of prominent Hungarians.",
                "Present conditions require the activities of the old Hungarian Charitable Society. There are a great number of Hungarians in and around Chicago who are in need of food, clothing, and shelter. All good Hungarian businessmen should give this careful thought. Through an organization such as this, work could be found for many. Aid received through an organization of this type, would be appreciated a lot more than aid from individuals.",
                "Today we have in Chicago a large group of influential Hungarians, who are both financially and socially prominent, and they could do a lot of good to help these unfortunate people.",
                "There are enough Hungarians in this city who could well afford to pay the yearly dues of ten dollars as was paid in the past by the members of the organization. There are many who could pay as high as two hundred dollars yearly.",
                "It is our idea that the time has come in Chicago when this group of beggars, and even more so those who are sitting back suffering quietly, should be taken care of by a regularly organized group of Hungarians. Those who are willing to aid financially should come out and put their arms around those sufferers, and help the more unfortunates across the deep ravines of starvation and hard times.",
                "This problem is a humanitarian duty, and it is needless to write more about it. This movement should be started, the sooner the better, because the hungry and ragged are at our doors, and there are many destitute Hungarians roaming the city streets. It is sorrowful, but we are satisfied that this is true.",
                "In the olden days, when the Austrian-Hungarian Empire existed, the Consul saw to it that aid was received from that government, because they had sufficient funds set aside for this purpose. It is useless to wait for such aid from the Hungarian Consul. Poverty is reigning in Hungary and it seems that they themselves will need help. We are left here alone to do this charitable work. We must bring this movement to life with our own strength, and start the work anew.",
                "This newspaper, keeping the interest of all Hungarians at heart, can be depended upon for a helping hand in promoting such a noble idea, but we will expect those Hungarians who know the value of this movement to help promote the idea and keep it from dying."

The cost of living has not been reduced, instead, it has become higher, and the number of unemployed has become greater with the return of the Soldiers from overseas. For this reason unemployment in this country has really become a serious question. The United States, previous to the War, was very happy and blossoming as a great consuming country. It produced cheaply, and it consumed lavishly.",

The effects of the War are greater than the War itself. The shattered morale, the horrors of hunger, the cessation of industrial life, the transportation systems being ruined, the transportation centers demolished, and the financial status of the countries, are the factors that have put Europe in a more precarious spot than the War itself.",

The hardships of today are altogether different from what they were after the Napoleonic Wars. Since the Napoleonic Wars, the industries of both the United States and Europe have been going through a stage of development. Social life is also a great deal different today than it was a hundred years ago.",
                "During the Napoleonic Wars, the population of Europe was only one hundred seventy-five million, while today, the population is over four hundred million. For example, we take England. This country has the most dense population of any European country. Here, the population averages about seven hundred people to the square mile. Agricultural activities in England are negligible. Only the small gardens of individual home owners are cultivated. In order that these people survive, they must keep up their industries in full operation at all times. During the past twenty-five years, England has been the master of international trade, which was due to the fact that her labor was very cheaply done.",

                "If the earning power of the people of Europe is cut down to little or nothing, then England's industries can not purchase food and raw materials. For this reason, the future of England hinges on the future of Europe. And if this uncertainty continues much longer, the people will emigrate from England or else, go into agriculture for a livelihood, which would impair the future of England.",
                "France, also, has a great deal of trouble. The cost of the government operation alone there is twenty-two million francs a year. But their greatest trouble lies in their industrial world. The largest part of their factories were ruined by the War, or else, they remained idle. Unemployment and the cessation of agricultural activities will cause an economic revolution sooner or later.",
                "Today, the future of the United States is tied much closer to Europe than it was previous to the War. The entire world owes the United States, therefore, the United States is interested in the future of the European nations. Before the nations of Europe can return to normal, the United States will have reached a point where the factories will be running at full capacity, and the United States will furnish the countries of Europe with both money and raw materials, and unemployment will have faded.",
                "But as long as there is no peace in Europe, factories are at a standstill and workers there do not start production.",

On calling this massmeeting, the Cultural Federation issued a call to all Hungarian associations in Chicago and vicinity to a conference on April 5.

Dr. Galambos was followed by Dr. Ernest Lovinger, Andor Wiener, Ignacio Izsak, and Joseph Pataki, all well-known speakers and noted public personalities of Chicago and vicinity, who in their turn delivered excellent speeches, enlightening the question from all points of view.

We can understand this only if we look at the facts of industrial revolution. Changes have occurred in the fields of industry and agriculture. Not only machinery is responsible for this. Production, compared to pre-war conditions, grew even without technical aid. Capitalism increased work tempo to the maximum without outside help. We cite a few facts: In 1914, nine bakers working eight hours a day baked 3060 loaves of bread, or 340 loaves each. In 1927, nine bakers in a seven-hour working day baked 3570 loaves of bread, or 396.6 loaves each. Production increased 33 per cent without mechanical aid.....",

Semi-automatic machines were improved and became wholly automatic. Obsolete machinery was disposed of as junk.

While on one hand it utilizes man-power to the utmost, on the other hand it can't employ millions of idle people. While it fills its warehouses speedily with its mass production, millions can't buy the most necessary industrial or agricultural products. On one side it amasses everything that man's creative power made possible, and on the other it allows the army of those who are condemned to death by starvation to become bigger day by day.....",

                "Upon disembarking from the S. S. \"President Roosevelt,\" one of my old American friends greeted me and whispered in my ear, \"My dear friend, please do not say that you are a socialist, because they do not like socialists here.\" He was right, since, for not following his advice, I was excluded from the land of liberty for five years. Since that time, MacDonald toured America, where he was warmly received, and, thanks to his influence, the order for my exclusion--in spite of my being a \"dangerous revolutionist\"--was suspended.",
                "It would be exaggeration to say that there is socialism in America today, yet the truth is that the masses are beginning to realize that their case is not hopeless. The first thunderbolt that struck Wall Street stirred the people, who thought at the time that unlimited speculation was the chief cause of the crash. However, when the stock market tumbled again, it had to be admitted that everything was not in order in the world's richest country.....",
                "American overproduction, the perfection of machinery, and the rationalization of production all tend to aggravate the world crisis of capitalism. American capitalism advanced faster, more brutally--it was not retarded by the difficulties that beset Europe. With the exception of the Southern states, there was, strictly speaking, no feudalism in the United States. There were no economic limits or traditions to hinder capitalism, which forged ahead by leaps and bounds, a fact of which the workers were unaware until now.",
                "Let us not forget that in America, during the capitalistic era, everyone was concerned with his own well-being only, no one worrying about the situation as a whole. Up to the present time, no one has had any anxiety. If it was hard to make a living in one field, there were other fields to try. No one noticed that in the meantime capitalism was being concentrated. Today the people understand that the same capitalism--God forgive it--which meant prosperity, is preparing to undermine the right of individual ownership. A number of the bourgeois are horrified to note that they are becoming impoverished and proletarian.....",
                "Since the end of the World War, America, taking advantage of the poverty of Europe, has conquered the markets of the Old World. Production in America was based on this new situation. However, America did not stop to think that Europe would gradually recover economically, a recovery that already has come about. Be it through socialism or \"Fordism\", the fact is that an organized drive, in the form of a United States of Europe, is on its way against the Americans' monopoly of foreign markets. It makes no difference to the New World whether the change in the European situation takes the form of socialism or capitalism, the fact remains that America will lose a valuable market for its goods.",
                "The crisis is increased by the fact that industry is not the only one to suffer from overproduction; agriculture, too, suffers a great deal. For instance, the Ford factories had to reduce their production from ten thousand to three thousand cars per month. The 1928 surplus is still in their warehouses.",
                "Before the World War, fifty per cent of the population of the United States was made up of farmers. This ratio has dropped to thirty per cent, which means that industrialization has increased.",
                "In view of this situation, the number of the unemployed is inevitably becoming larger and larger every day. As no official statistics on the number of the unemployed have been made, it is difficult to give an exact figure, but it is thought that there are from four to eight million people without work in this country.",
                "I saw machines that can do the work of two, three, and four hundred people. The fate of the unemployed is made worse because the government does not give any kind of relief to them. This brutality is a newer proof of the unscrupulous methods used by American capitalists, who do not see the necessity of compensating the unemployed. The proletariat is not sufficiently organized. There are not more than two million organized workers in the United States, as the task of organizing the workers who flocked here from all parts of the world has been difficult. Immigration kept the workers on the move continually from East to West, and the different nationalities, as in the tower of Babel, were unable to understand each other. With the closing of the doors of the United States to immigration, it is anticipated that the socialist and trade-union movements will gain ground.",
                "The repetition of the crash of the stock market not only ruined the economic foundation of the United States, but also disillusioned the optimistic conceptions of Americans.",
                "The American citizen believed with peculiar naivete that he had to thank his racial superiority for prosperity. Some went so far as to say that Almighty God rewarded Americans because their moral conception and energy were superior to those of other people. There was an element of mysticism, a heaven-sent gift, in this unbelievable conception of prosperity.",
                "Another circumstance aggravates the American economic crisis. Instead of practicing economy, as in the Old World, the capitalistic system in the New World advocated squandering. Buying senselessly was instigated by unbelievably shrewd advertising. The crisis is the more unbearable because the public has become accustomed to a higher standard of living, a standard which is only possible when the worker receives his wages regularly. Today, the worker, besides being unable to indulge in luxury, finds himself deep in debt for things he bought on the various installment plans.",
                "The installment system is an American invention that exhausts the consumer leaving him like a squeezed lemon. Houses, automobiles, typewriters, clothes, tools can be paid for on a monthly payment system. It can safely be said that ninety per cent of the salaries are mortgaged in advance.",
                "The foregoing is the situation in a nutshell, and still one can't express his doubts about prosperity. The newspapers never publish anything that would contradict this stubborn optimism.....The press is not supported by the readers but by the advertisers. We have the Saturday Evening Post as an example--it costs but five cents a copy, but an advertisement in it costs one or even two thousand dollars.",
                "Although I could not state my opinion of the economic crisis in the American newspapers, still the audiences at my lectures were interested in this topic most.",
                "The lecturer is assailed by questions so childish that they sound foolish. I was asked whether I could define the difference between socialism and anarchism. Furthermore, I was asked what is the difference between French, English, German and Russian socialism.....The answer to these questions was made difficult by the total absence of elementary theoretical knowledge on the part of the American audiences. An American attends a lecture with the intention of finding a radical cure for his ills. He feels that his country is not on the right road, that its economic theory is all wrong, and he expects the lecturer to prescribe a remedy. Nothing is more disappointing to an audience than the lecturer's obscure answer.....",
                "American ideology is traveling in the direction of collectivism, and standardized life will make the transition to socialism easier, but it is doubtful whether the change will take place smoothly. That unspeakable brutality with which the Americans treat not only the Negroes but the \"inferior\" immigrants, proves that their morals have not improved and that there will be a bitter struggle. I am positive that the unfortunate Sacco and Vanzetti would have escaped the electric chair had their eyes been blue instead of black.",
                "If a European country commits a crime, it tries to justify it by moral and legal reasons. In America this is done more simply. They cynically assert, \"We know that Sacco and Vanzetti were innocent of the crime for which they were electrocuted, and that Tom Mooney has been suffering in a prison for nearly fourteen years, but they were all dangerous revolutionists, so we were justified in committing a theoretical crime against them.\"",
                "I am positive that nowhere in the world will the war between capitalism and proletarianism be bloodier than in America."

The chain store takes the place of the small, independent stores, and the factories do away with the smaller industries.....

If production, transportation, and sales were managed, not for the benefit of private profiteers, but for the benefit of mankind, most probably the cost of commodities could be paid in pennies instead of dollars.

Before the war, when these great lords were full of hopes of victory, they did not flatter us as they do now. Then, a working man or Magyar-American could not come near to a great lord; now, the times have changed, and the newspapers are full of the nice-sounding words of Count Apponyi, who calls us his \"kin\".

Meanwhile let us put the uninvited visitor in his proper place.",

Therefore it should be condemned just as I will condemn it, if we aim to believe in American ideals.\"",
                "At the end of his speech he asked that Coolidge make a definite statement declaring himself as to how he stands with reference to this question, in order that this question be eliminated from the political field.",

                "The Catholics, the Jews and the Colored people, regardless whether they are immigrants or not, are the Klan's natural enemies. The Ku Klux Klan brand these people as criminals.",
                "In certain states they have very good connections. In certain cities and towns their activities are shameful, and they are living through a mania of hunting people. There is even murder attached to the name of the \"Klan.\"",
                "It is a sad situation indeed when such an ignorant and unbridled organization such as the Klan breaks through the crust of civilization in a great country like the United States.",
                "Therefore, it is very important that our leading politicians declare themselves in regard to this issue, in order that such an organization be stamped out like weeds which bob up from time to time and later endanger the life of the entire nation.",
                "Therefore it is the duty of us immigrant American citizens to watch, and think seriously about which of the leaders of the two great parties will protect those rights which were given to us when we become citizens of this country. We must also see to it, that national peace is preserved, and advancement and security for all is assured.",
                "When we are assured of the man from whom we can expect these things on a liberal and progressive basis, we will join hands with that party in order to give more assurance for success, so that every inhabitant of the United States regardless of color, creed or nationality will have equal rights.",
                "Now we wait with curiosity as to what President Coolidge will have to say to this invitation."

Friday the 3rd of May this general meeting was held in the Hungarian House. Two out of three political clubs consented without opposition to the fusion, and submitted themselves to the wishes of the meeting. As the meeting discussed all the questions thoroughly, the time was so far advanced, that the participants could only elect the new president in the person of Jack Rosenfeld, and as for the election of the other officers it was decided, that a new meeting should convene on the next Friday, the 10th of May at the same place."

In this way, the amount saved was small.",

Let us think of the last six months when the majority in America have either become unemployed, or are working for very small wages. Yet we must live. Living expenses and clothing still remain at a high level. In fact, there is a movement going on to raise rent prices. So it is understood, that the poor worker must of necessity reach for his meager savings.

Only England and France could accomplish this, and because they are the beneficiaries of the treaty, the politicians and diplomats do not want to hear of any such actions.

To gain our confidence with useless phrases, is impossible, for we are tired of hearing them, and do not want to hear any more of such flowery phrases.",
                "If our homeland desires to step into closer relationship with us, they should not send titled gentlemen to us, who throughout their lifetime, have taken advantage of the poor Hungarian working class, and have taken their last drop of blood away from them. They should send such men who fight for the poor working people, men who struggle and suffer with them. These men will not come to us with flowery phrases, but with the actual truth. We will believe and make our sacrifices for these men.",
                "When those titled gentlemen arrive, we will graciously welcome them, for they, too, are the sons of our homeland. We will also watch the parade, in fact, perhaps, we will join them, as long as it will not cost us money. We bring to the attention of the Hungarians in America, far in advance, to watch their pocket books very closely, see that they do not become empty. To empty the pocket books of the Hungarian-Americans, is the sincere desire of the titled gentlemen from Hungary."

                "Our growth and our activities seem to indicate that we should play an important part in politics, but there is a reason for our being so far behind in political achievements. That reason is that there is a great deal of jealousy existing among us.",
                "On the other hand, it is possible that the politicians regard us as being rather stupid. They feel that we are easily led, or else they think that we are incapable of selecting an able spokesman from our midst. There is nothing more disgusting in the eyes of the American people than the spectacle of one national group being dependent on another for political favors.",
                "The truth of the above statements was clearly demonstrated last Friday when a committee composed of Frank, Kalman, Banffy, Butscher, Schwartz, Reiger, Nagy, Grosz, and Izsak, representing the Chicago Hungarian Republican Club, took part in a Republican rally at the Sherman House. The appearance of the Hungarian committee came as a surprise to the other people who attended this meeting, and the presence of the Hungarians became the general topic of the day.",
                "At 3:30 P. M. the Hungarian delegation was introduced from the speakers' platform, from which Senator Harding, State's Attorney Crowe and Colonel Luby very cordially greeted them. The introductions were performed by Mr. Frank, the chairman of the committee.",
                "Mr. Izsak, the secretary of the committee, then explained why the Hungarian delegation had come. During the course of his speech, he pointed out how unfairly the Hungarian people had been dealt with in the field of politics during the past twenty-five years. He stressed the fact that the Hungarian people had been loyal to the party, but that they had never received any favors in return. He openly admitted that if the Republican party did not favor the Hungarians with three political jobs, the Hungarians would swing to the party that has already promised these [jobs].",
                "The answer that State's Attorney Crowe gave to all this was rather surprising. He said that he knew just exactly how the committee felt about this matter. He frankly admitted that the Hungarians were not represented in any of the political offices in the city. He said that was neither his nor the party's fault. The Hungarians had never formally asked for anything. It has always been thought that if someone wants something, he generally asks for it. He sincerely promised that the Republican party would satisfy the request of the committee, and then asked for the names of the members of the Hungarian Republican Club who were worthy of receiving these three appointments.",
                "The Chicago Hungarian Club has done its duty. A bargain has been struck, and it has been concluded in a gentlemanly manner. The promise was thoroughly sincere, but if it remains a promise with nothing really being done, then the Hungarian Republican Club will know what to do.",
                "State's Attorney Crowe said that if someone wants something he generally asks for it, but if the request is to be at all effective it must be accompanied by action. In the first place, we must organize under one banner, and we must trust our leaders; we must work in harmony for one big cause. We must not permit jealousies to arise when some individual makes more headway in the field of politics than another. We want to safeguard the good name of the Hungarians; we do not want that name to be ridiculed. If we all pull together then the Hungarian people of Chicago can reach the same heights in the political world that other nationalities have attained."

The most important job is that of president of the United States, then that of mayor of New York City, and after this that of mayor of Chicago. The relative importance of these positions is measured by the number of jobs each has at its disposal. The mayor of Chicago has pretty close to five thousand jobs to give out. It is a known fact that Chicago is the most mixed and most cosmopolitan city in the United States, therefore it is reasonable that each nationality should organize its own political clubs in order that it may take part in the campaign and help the people get interested in the political life of the city.",
                "It is a rather serious proposition, but we cannot speak too seriously of the activities of the Chicago Hungarians. In American political life they are mere novices, and although there are quite a large number of Hungarian-American citizens in the city of Chicago, they do not understand the first thing about politics. This is the only reason for the sorrowful situation that out of ten thousand Hungarian-American citizens residing in and around Chicago, there is not a single one who has ever held a political position. It is true that there are a few men of Hungarian descent who have held and hold political positions, but they did not receive these positions through the backing of the Hungarians, but by their own individual efforts. With the other nationalities it is just the opposite. Each national group with the exception of the Hungarian, organizes and then demands that the group be well represented. It isn't a very nice thing to say and we do not like to write about it, but the Hungarian people are rather far behind. Individually we Hungarians are a fine race but collectively we enjoy no recognition in the American political arena. We have based this conclusion on what we observe among the Hungarians of Chicago, but the statement holds true for the entire Hungarian population of America, with the exception of New York City.",
                "Sick benefit and church societies are the only organizations active and strong among the Hungarian people. They cannot, however, get mixed up in politics and there are very few if any that would be willing to enter the political field. As things now stand, when an election comes up Hungarian political clubs are formed, which disband immediately after the campaign is over.",
                "Now that the mayoral election is approaching, two Hungarian political clubs have been organized--one Republican and the other Democratic. Unquestionably, before elections are over there will be one or two others. The [political] position of the Hungarian people has not been properly cleared up as yet, and this is the reason why, as a group, they cannot pick a candidate of their own. It is our hope that as the election gets closer the different Hungarian groups will unite instead of pulling apart, for if they do not unite, their political activities will never amount to anything. The ripening process in politics is very hard. It is necessary to have a little intelligence, a little cooperation, and a bit of common sense. Perhaps the politically ambitious Hungarians have come to realize this in the past few years. If they have, then it is time that they organize in a hurry and talk politics loudly and seriously. However, if they are just looking for glory and nothing else, they should hide themselves in shame, as they would only make a laughing stock out of the Hungarian people. It will kill us, and we do not want the hard-developing Hungarian name and future killed."

We advanced our confidence in Harding, but we insist on our privilege to criticize, because we are not going to blindly agree to all the Republicans' actions. We want our readers to see what the entire political change means, and why the American political situation is an eye-sore. Those politicians who sought positions and are now job olders have a livelihood, while we poor workers can expect no exceptional economic change.",
                "If there is work, then we will work, if not, then we starve, whether Harding or anyone else sits in the White House. Harding will bring neither work nor good wages. The domination of the capitalists, over both political parties, is the cause behind the depression.",

For those who still are doubtful of our opinions and maintain and believe, that under Harding's leadership some radical changes for the better in our political life will result, we are at your service and will review some of the great changes brought about by Harding.",
                "Look at some of the construction changes. From Harding's first actions and steps we can already see a great change. His first action was to name his life-long friend and family physician, to be the Chief U. S. medical officer with a mere $6,000 salary and other considerations, which boost his income to the $10,000 mark.",
                "Therefore, the small town doctor from Marion, Ohio, becomes a Brigadier General, but not because there is a great need for a house physician in the White House.",

                "This is truly a change. Wilson did not do such things. That is an old Republican custom. Was this change worth voting for? Let us go on. From Marion, Ohio, Harding called to Washington another good old neighbor, a very wealthy friend, Crissinger by name. Hurriedly he named him to a very fat position, Treasurer of the United States. This position pays only a very meager salary of $10,000 a year, but what is that between brothers? Well, Harding will not become lonely in Washington because of the great change. Dr. Sawyer and Mr. Crissinger, his bosom friends, will be there to ease the pains of homesickness.",
                "This is the way he is introducing the great change. Harding named Farrell to the Shipping Board, where he will handle billions of dollars worth of important transactions. Farrell is the president of the Steel trust. This is another great change, the great result of our vote.",
                "We see that Harding is very choosey with his appointments. He is always appointing those whom he favors most, whether it be the president of the Steel trust or a friendly neighbor. By this, without any doubt, he is outdoing Wilson tremendously, and truly we will agree that the election of Harding means a change. Not only do we feel the results of the change from the appointments, but also the change of foreign and political principles are felt. President Harding also created this change.",
                "Let us not forget, that during the election campaigns, from Harding down to the last grafting politician, they preached to the people, that when they come into power, among other things, they would create a new order in foreign policies. Let us see in what way have they changed their policies from those of the terrible days of Wilson.",
                "Harding asked the Senators to allow the treaty made with Columbia to stand.",
                "This is the treaty which was bitterly opposed by the Republican Senators for over two years, while Wilson was President. Our readers can be assured that the Republican Senators and Harding are now doing this in behalf of the great change, though, in the first place, Wilson asked this of them.",
                "The new Secretary of State, strange to relate, has accepted without change, Wilson's pacts regarding the Japs and Mesopotamia. For the time being, Harding is quietly watching and waiting the Mexican situation, again following Wilson's course. Here Harding forgot to make a change. We believe, this great change, is rather a change in people only, and we will find some new gentlemen, strange faces, and hungry politicians around the meat pot. The old order will remain the same.",
                "For all of that, we are not angry at Mr. Harding. He cannot do anything more clever than to forget his party's election promises and platform. This sudden loss of memory is an asset that is understood by all politicians. Why bother making changes here or there, let it remain as it is, even in Foreign affairs.",

                "I did not find it difficult to locate someone who had enlightening information about politics in the United States. There is only one real Hungarian politician in Chicago. There are many so-called \"curb-stone\" politicians, who do a lot of talking without accomplishing anything, but there is one Hungarian who is very active and influential in the political life of this country. He is Dr. Adolf Weiner, a lawyer. Therefore, I decided to visit Dr. Weiner, who is located on the fifth floor of the Cook County Building. Dr. Weiner greeted me very cordially, guessing immediately that I was the editor of a Hungarian newspaper, and that I was about to ask for an interview. Dr. Weiner asked me what I wanted, and I immediately answered that I was looking for political information, and that I would like to hear his views on the presidential election.",

                "Dr. Weiner then went on to speak of the platforms of the two political parties, pointing out the advantages of the Democratic platform as compared with the Republican. He explained that the tariff question was the important issue of the campaign. He expressed himself also on the Volstead Act, stating that, in his opinion, Cox was liberal enough to see the uselessness of this law.",
                "I then asked him which party he thought would help Hungary, and the Hungarians of America, the most. As he answered this question, a sad look came over his face, but he gave me his honest opinion. \"As far as Hungary is concerned,\" he said, \"it does not make very much difference who becomes president of the United States.\" He stated that the only ways in which conditions could be remedied in Hungary would be by the enactment of new laws, by more conscientious work on the part of the Hungarian government itself, and by the co-operation of the people for a better government.",
                "Dr. Weiner told me that the part of Hungary from which he originally came was now Czechoslovakian territory. He said that he was still Hungarian in heart and soul, even though he has been a resident of this country for the past twenty-seven years. I might mention here that Dr. Weiner received his education in the city of Vienna, and for the past twenty-five years has been one of the most prominent lawyers in Chicago.",
                "The last question I asked Dr. Weiner was whether he thought it possible to form a political organization among the Hungarian people of Chicago, and, if such an organization were formed, which party it should support.",
                "\"Organizing Hungarian-Americans\", Dr. Weiner answered, \"is a very hard job. The Republicans always vote for the Republican candidate, and the Democrats for the Democratic candidate, but if Hungarians were to organize, each member would want to be the leader of his organization. This is the worst fault of the Hungarians. If there were four thousand members, there would be four thousand leaders. The Hungarian-Americans have not learned the principles of co-operation, and would rather vote for a Slav or an Irishman than for a Hungarian. This is the reason Hungarian politicians do not get anywhere; if they do get a public office, they obtain it without the aid of their brother Hungarians.\"",
                "Dr. Weiner advised us that Cox, the Democratic presidential candidate, if elected, would probably do more for Hungary than any of the other candidates, because the Democrats have a more liberal platform with reference to foreign policy and immigration. The Republicans have always taken a harsh stand against immigration.",
                "The Hungarian-Americans are mostly industrial workers, and the Democratic party is a workers' party. Candidate Cox has been governor of Ohio for three terms, each time being elected by the vote of the great number of industrial workers of Ohio. Therefore, it is clear that, if the Hungarian workers are to cast their votes to the best advantage, they must vote Democratic.",
                "I now left Dr. Weiner, fully satisfied that I had been right in going to see him, because I feel sure that Dr. Weiner understands the social problems of America. I am grateful that he talked with me, neglecting other and more important people who were waiting to see him. Furthermore, he told me that he would be glad to discuss the political question again at any time with any representative of the Magyar Tribune."

Now a bosom-friend of the above politician, Judge Wilson issued an injunction, in which he forbids the police to interfere with the operation of the slot-machines, in other words it did not allow the police to do its duty prescribed by law. At the sight of such gross lawlessness some of the more conscientious members of the legislature asked for impeachment of Judge Wilson, but the House on the proposition of Repr. Frank Ryan from Chicago, voted 63:61 against the starting of the inquiry and there will be no impeachment process against Judge Wilson.",

Not a day passes without a mysterious gang killing. Chicago today is known the world over as the home of gangsters.",
                "Nobody can deny that this reputation is detrimental to Chicago and its population. It is damaging, both materially and spiritually. The damage is material because of the number of visitors lost to our city, since thousands of people are afraid to visit Chicago because of the possibility of falling victims to stray bullets. As a result, we lose millions of dollars annually and, although the loss is felt most directly by hotels, restaurants, and department stores, in the end we all feel it, too.",

                "We wrote in our columns about the program of the Revisionist meeting arranged by the Federation of the Churches and Associations of Chicago South Side last Thursday evening, but to be very frank, we do not believe much in its merits. We know that the fiasco of the Revisionist meeting in New York still lingers in the memory of the Hungarians. We saw the frequent changing of plans for the arrangements of the meeting. Also, we did not think that the short time allowed would suffice for debating the subjects of Revisionist meeting. But we would be mistaken, if we said that this meeting was unimportant.",
                "Apparently, it was a success. Thirty-five Associations had sent about one hundred representatives besides some two hundred Hungarians, interested in the aims of the meeting and to participate in the debate about revision.",
                "The meeting scheduled for 7 P.M. was opened at 8:15 P.M. by John Bartus, president of the Federation of Churches and Associations of Chicago South Side. At the request of Etelka Revesz, the Hungarian anthem was sung. Mr. Bartus asked the audience to appoint a committee whose duty should be to formulate a program. He proposed that one delegate from each district in Chicago and vicinity should be elected to serve on this committee.",
                "The committee was made up as follows: The Hungarians of Chicago North Side were represented by Paul Soos, president of the Culture Club; the Hungarians of Chicago West Side were represented by William Mayer; those of Burnside by Charles Tarjanyi; of South Chicago by Emery Fegyverneki; East Chicago by John Tenkely; Indiana Harbor by George Soltesz; Hammond by John Bander. The committee nominated as chairman, George Mihok, president of the district of Verhovay branches; and as recorders; Emery Fegyverneki and Frank Foldi.",
                "At this time Mihok took the chair. William Mayer arose to report that he had with him a copy of a letter written by Frank Gondor, the original of which was sent to the committee from New York, but if the bad weather conditions had prevented the mailman from delivering the letters, he brought a copy along in case the original had not arrived in time. He asked to have it read before the assembly. John Bartus answered that the letter had arrived and would be read together with other correspondence. This started a controversy of an hour and a half duration. The I W O members demanded that the letters be read; the Hungarians opposed them.",
                "In the meantime, Ernest Kasas, Frank Szabo, Cornel Bors, Louis Nemeth, Mrs. John Paszternak and others spoke. Some spoke of the Revision, some of the letter of Gombos, some again of the scandal in New York. The majority, evidently, were against the reading of the letter, so the recorder read the first of the proposals for a resolution, which contained about five or six points. The audience decided it would debate the points separately.",
                "The letter of Gombos still proved a source of interest and most certainly there were many, who although opposing its being read, yet were curious about its contents. Everybody awaited some sensation from it. As the demands for its reading were renewed, although the audience had not yet voted, on even one of the points under discussion, the chairman ordered the reading of the letter. It is hard to imagine what the communists expected from it, but those who were waiting for some exictement from it, were bitterly disappointed.",
                "Frank Gondor, on behalf of the committee in New York greeted the audience of Chicagoans and asked them not to make the same mistake as did the people in New York, but try to arrive at a mutual understanding. He urged them to work for the benefit of the noble cause for which the meeting had been arranged.",
                "Whether or not to have this letter read stirred up a debate for one and one half hours. The mischievous Mayer again fooled the Hungarians. But after the letter had been read you could not hold them there any longer. It was now after ten P.M. Of the many very serious and very useful propositions, only one point of the first proposition was accepted by the meeting. We reprint it here. It is a nice bouquet for the Szabadsag [Hungarian Daily]:",
                "\"The Hungarians of Chicago and vicinity declared at their meeting, held on February 20, in the Hungarian House in Chicago, that they fully approve and regard as absolutely useful the movement of the Hungarian Daily, Szabadsag under the title \"One million signatures plan\" which we support and highly recommend to every good Hungarian. We ask the Szabadsag to continue with renewed zeal to sponsor the seemingly lagging movement and we also ask the Nepszava and all the local Hungarian weeklies to support the movement to the best of their ability.",
                "There was no time for anything else. These men, who work hard all day, usually want to be home not later than eleven P.M. The members of the I W O would stay till dawn, but with them alone, the chairman was not willing to pass resolutions in regard of revision. At 10:30 P.M., he declared the meeting adjourned.",
                "Speaking of the I W O members, we gladly note it for the sake of truth, that at this meeting they behaved themselves much better then we expected. There were suggestions about \"inner-revision,\" but they did not go so far as to even mention the names of their Rakosi or that of Bela Kun who, incidentally, on that same day celebrated his fiftieth birthday. It was Joseph Hernes, the member of Branch 1035 of the I W O, who answered the speech made by Ernest Kasas, who spoke on the subject of the expected results of the plebiscite for those coming from the territories lost by Hungary in the peace treaties. Hernes said:",
                "\"The government should create such living conditions for the working people living in Hungary that in case a plebiscite should be ordered in the detached parts of old Hungary, the people living there should vote of their own volition, in their own interest, so that they should be anxious to get back to their own old mother country.\"",

                "On the eve of love and forgiveness, we find it appropriate to remember a man whom many blame, justly or unjustly, for the misfortunes of Hungary as well as for the turmoil of the entire world. If we are to give an unbiased verdict, we must consider the factors that brought about these conditions.",
                "There are three factors which govern human activities--heredity, environment, and contact. The first factor made itself felt in Wilson's stubborn nature. The second left deep imprints on his life. Wilson was born and reared in the downtrodden South after the Civil War. The politics of the North then seemed unfair, since the white people were neglected and the colored people were continually favored by the political leaders of the North. This fact irritated the feelings of the young Wilson, and he never forgot the poverty which the people of the South had been forced to suffer. When he became President of the United States, he favored the people of the South at every opportunity. Most of his aides were from the South. Most of the appointments to army posts during the World War were given to Southerners, while most of the Northern boys were sent South to work with the colored boys in road construction gangs.",
                "The third factor, his contacts, was responsible for his autocratic ideas. Born into the family of a Southern leader, raised in a highly developed intellecutal environment, he became president of Princeton University, then Governor of New Jersey, and finally President of the United States. This autocratic feeling became evident when he selected his cabinet. He chose men who would act blindly at his command, men who, as time went on, became merely his rubber stamps.",
                "If we ask what the talisman was with which he gained the support of the American people, we can only answer in one way. He was an eloquent speaker, one with whom very few other speakers could be compared. Dumba, the Austro-Hungarian ambassador, was in Chicago in 1914, and talked to the writer of these lines. He stated that he did not believe there was another man living who had mastered the art of public speaking as well as President Wilson had.",
                "Perhaps some people were awed and others were mentally sluggish and without forethought, but the fact remains that most of them received Wilson's miraculous utterances, heard all over the world, as an oracle, and his ideas and doctrines were accepted as gospel by even half-barbaric peoples. In effect, the world recognized a new Moses, whose will and ideas were divinely inspired.",
                "Wilson was a master of ideas, but he could not handle people. He was aware of the fact that through his theories he could reach the mind, but that to grasp the soul of the individual his theories must attain idealistic heights. As is the case with all great individuals, Wilson also had a weakness--he was susceptible to flattery.",
                "If Wilson had not gone to Europe, he probably would be living today.",
                "Clemenceau, Lloyd George, and Orlando managed to evade responsibilities, by referring back to their respective governments the decision on important issues. Wilson did not have any one to turn to. He was the chief executive of a nation. History should take note of the schemes used by the European crafty foxes in their efforts to shift to Wilson the responsibility of making a decision in delicate issues. We will mention only the mandate over Armenia and the Fiume verdict, both of which were so written that regardless of how Wilson interpreted them he could gain only enemies.",
                "True, it was a grave mistake on his part to have submitted his Fourteen Point program. If he could have risen to the height of the situation, he would have pointed out the fact that the United States had fought in the World War for ideals, and that if the Allies wanted, as conquerors, a selfish peace, he would leave the conference, return home, and make a separate peace treaty with the Central Powers. Had he only gone a little further and announced that the United States would refuse to lend the Allies any more money, but instead would expect them to pay their debts in a very short time, his ideals would have triumphed, because the Allies were in no condition to risk losing the friendship of the United States. But if, from one angle, the mutilation of Hungary can be attributed in part to Wilson's passivity, Wilson cannot, from any other standpoint, be called an enemy of the Hungarian people.",
                "On September 18, 1918, the Hungarian people of Chicago and vicinity raised the flag of the Hungarian Republic. They unfurled this flag with the cooperation of the Chicago Hungarian Social and Sick Benefit Society. We thought at that time that our homeland might be saved in its hour of distress. The American press aided us in our movement, while our own daily papers stood by and watched.",
                "Certain understanding American men, such as Augustus Lukeman and ex-Senator Hamilton Lewis, informed President Wilson of our activities. President Wilson then announced that if a few other Hungarian communities would make similar demonstrations, he would be willing to receive Hungarian delegates from industrial sections--and that following this reception he would officially recognize the Hungarian Republican movement.",
                "That these things never happened must be blamed partly on our daily newspapers, which paid little or no attention to the matter, and partly on the flu epidemic, which made meetings at this time impossible. It is a certainty, though, that if Wilson had recognized the activities of the Hungarian-Americans, Hungary would never have been dismembered to the extent that it actually was.",
                "Every man has his faults, and so had Wilson. But no man deserves the bitterness which our position has made us feel toward Wilson. There is only one question we must ask ourselves. Did this man try to do the most good possible for the greatest number of people? Wilson voiced ideals that in years to come will have great effects on international affairs. His faults will be forgotten, and all that will be remembered will be his theories and their effect upon mankind.",
                "Doctor Alderman spoke justly of him when, in an address delivered in Washington in memory of Wilson, he made the following remarks:",
                "\"As death hovered over him, men stopped amid their work and unconsciously felt that an individual blessed with great faith had lived among them. An apparition of a great man with a beautiful soul arose before them. They understood that our leader was a prophet, and for a moment their hearts were filled with warm sentiments. They felt that a fearless and generous man, with a warm heart and an unflinching will, had this slow-moving humanity in his grasp in his effort to be one with those who are called deathless and to enter the eternal Pantheon in glory.\""

This was a very disgusting sight. The soldiers wore several kinds of uniforms. Some of them wore home-spun peasant garb. Some wore boots, some wore shoes, and some wore peasant sandals, while others were bare foot. Their horses were sick with scabies.",
                "The important thing to do first was to clothe the tattered militia. The next movement was the organization of the government Council, which issued a call to all Hungarian officials to take an oath of allegiance to the new government. As a result of this call, the Saikels, who claim to be descendants of King Attila, were the first to take the oath. The others, Magyars and Jews, refused to take the oath, because they believed that the Rumanian rule would not last long.",

                "A Provisional secretary's office was established by the Rumanian government in Transylvania. The duty of this office was to issue permits for carrying provisions from one town to the other, even for his own consumption. The price of the permit was from ten to one thousand Crowns. It depended on the length of service of the party on duty at the Secretary's door. If the policeman were a new man; he would be satisfied with ten Crowns, but if he had been employed there for a longer time, he would have learned the game and would not accept less than one hundred crowns.",
                "The legal rules of the court are many. If two Rumanians are involved in a law-suit, as defendant and plaintiff, there is a regular legal trial. If only one of the litigants is Rumanian, the latter wins the case. If two non-Rumanians are the litigants, he wins, who pays most. I know of one case in particular where one of my clients received three different decisions by three Ministerial decrees.",

                "One forenoon, I wanted to see the Police captain regarding my passport, and, as a friend of the Police Captain, I thought it unnecessary to bow to the policeman standing at the entrance and ask permission from him. As I entered, the officer ran after me, trying to stop me, but ignoring his warning, I continued on my way. Then he grabbed me by my coat and rudely pulled me back. I, of course, became enraged, and slapped his face.",

The poorer classes wanted land and expected an improvement in the general economic situation. Both classes, were disappointed, and are thoroughly dissatisfied now.\""

The shameful ingratitude accorded the United States for the services in saving England from being expelled from the face of the earth by the Germans is clearly shown in an article in the issue of Herald and Examiner on January 15, page 1. This article describes how the American Mariners are murdered by the English in Cork.",

It is enough to say that by God's grace the American people soon enough came to their senses and left the whole \"crooked business\" to England who alone is worthy of it. Nevertheless, America is cautious enough, and she declares she wants to be at peace with the whole world. Still she builds the largest navy in the world, which England cannot duplicate until she pays the debt owing to the United States. Since England is so beggarly that she cannot afford to pay even the interest, we have still less hope of ever getting the capital. England cannot be taken seriously, she cannot keep pace with us in the development of armaments.",
                "Who would furnish her with money for that? All Europe is bankrupt, and this bankruptcy was staged by England and we must admit that she was successful, at the same time, bled us. I am certain of this, however, England will not succeed in bluffing away the large amounts of money given to her by the United States, because if she were to resort to such tactics America will give her a thrashing, and that with not over-exertion.",
                "As to the German-Russian-Japanese alliance, it is not news to me, for I predicted it four years ago, and what the result would be. I have foretold too that England will be the first country to try to get away from the old alliance. She will join a new alliance to again be on the side of the victors. Of course, England forgets that Germany knows her cunning, hypocritical, policy, and she will not confer with her.",
                "If the German-Russian-Japanese alliance begins its work, I think that work will have a tendency to bring to reason the old English-French alliance, because these \"running footmen\" implored America, with tears, to save them, and since the people here were not very enthusiastic to stop the army of English-French alliance in their flight, certain business-interests might have forced our sons to go over whether or not to prevent the English and French army from disappearing from the earth. Thus, the great English-French victory was won. When the armistice was signed on the basis of the fourteen points of the president of the United States, everybody believed, not only the central powers, but the whole civilized world, was certain that these points would bring universal peace. Instead of peace, the English-French craze gained ground, the results of which are now apparent. I think the new alliance wants to replace what the Englsh-French craze spoiled.",

At the present time, these facts remain to be proved. One thing we do know is, that it is imperative to know all about this very important matter.",

This is considered as a punishment to the above named nations.",

Russia is not a member yet, either, because Russia seems to be preparing for war against the whole world, though it is only a matter of time before Russia will join the League, even though its political views will be entirely different from the rest of the world.",

                "It is not necessary to dig into history to discover that Hungary, before the war, was a natural country, just as Bohemia, the Czechs part of Czecho-Slovakia, is also a natural country. Its natural boundaries were perfect. On the north, the west and the southeast, it was rimmed with high mountains. On the south, its boundaries are formed by large rivers. It is one of the most perfectly closed basins that can be found on any of the five continents. The Czechs argue that their country is a natural country, and has always belonged to them, therefore, the millions of Germans within their boundaries must bow to the will of the Czechs. For this same reason, Hungary wants to keep her natural country intact. Strangely enough, there are many people, who recognize the justice of the argument of the Czechs, but cannot see where a similar argument on the part of the Magyars is worth its weight in sour apples. As a result, the boundaries of Hungary to-day are nothing but red lines on maps. They are natural boundaries, and Hungary is bound and determined to regain most of the land that has been taken from her.",
                "In the north, Hungary has lost Slovakia and Russiani, these two countries being at the extreme tip of Hungary. In the east, she has lost the huge rough triangle of Transylvania to the Rumanians. In the west, she has lost the small strip of Germany west of Hungary to Austria, and in the south, she has lost Croatia and Slovenia to the Jugo-Slavs. All that remains is the Magyar kernel, which was the center of the old Hungary.",
                "There is practically no outcry from the Magyars over the loss of Croatia and Slovania, the districts behind Fiume and the Dalmatian coast, which now make up the upper end of Jugo-Slavia. The Croats have been a distinct, warlike, and progressive people for centuries. Until the day of the Armistice, they fought hard and valiantly against Italy and the Allies on the side of Austria-Hungary. So the esteem of the Magyars for the Croats is high as brother warriors, whereas they loathe the Czechs. Of all their enemies, the Italians held the Croat regiments of the Austro-Hungarian Army in the highest respect. The Magyars have great sympathy and love for them. For years, Croatia has been a state under the care of Hungary. Hungary is sorry to lose Croatia, but so far as we can find out, there is no bitterness over the slicing of Croatia.",
                "But over the losses to the Slovaks, Rumanians, and Austrians, the Magyars are making such an uproar that the ear drums of any stranger in Hungary are constantly being dulled. They say that the wrenching away of these parts of Hungary is comparable only to the partition in Poland, and the theft of Alsace and Lorraine by Germany.",
                "One hears the phrase, \"For over a thousand years,\" so many times in the course of a day here in Hungary that he finds himself walking along whispering over and over again in tune with his footsteps: \"For over a thousand years.\" He unconsciously sets it to all the tunes of the Hungarian orchestra music. The rattle of horses' hoofs seem to click out the words, \"For over a thousand years.\"",
                "All Magyar arguments are based on these very words. Because of those thousand years, the Magyars grit their teeth, and say, No! No! Never! when asked to submit to the partition of their country.",
                "The Magyars are the direct descendants of an Asiatic tribe of people who hailed from the rich lands around the sea of Asov, and their chief means of support was obtained by swooping on a neighboring tribe, the reby providing themselves with supplies and moving on. It is highly probable that if Attila, the well-known Hun, had not damaged his reputation by his loose methods of waging war, the Magyars would claim a distant relationship with Attila and his warriors. Attila, at the present time, is rather neglected in most histories of the Magyars. The greatest of all Magyar leaders is said to be Arpad.",
                "However, none of these early Magyar leaders were honored with triumph for their clever work.",
                "Many men were lost in the thousand years of conquest of Hungary, and now after a thousand years the real Hungary is to be crippled, and the most vital sections taken from her.",

                "Since the signing of the Armistice, there has come to our attention at regular intervals the matter of bringing before a court of justice those persons who were responsible for the war. This is a very good idea, but it seems that the real question is not to bring those persons to justice, but to determine who really was responsible for the war.",
                "I repeat, the punishment idea is very good, but as put forth by the French politicians, it takes on more of an aspect of vengeance than of punishment. Society punishes criminals to prevent crime, but not in a spirit of vengeance. The Good Book warns, \"Vengeance is mine, sayeth the Lord.\" Who are these French politicians that they should set themselves up as \"Solomons\" in an issue that concerns the whole world?",
                "You will notice that in signing the Peace Treaty, the Germans signified their willingness to give up everybody and everything asked by the Allies. But once the document was signed, Mr. Clememceau engineered his vengeful demands. The Germans saw fit to regard these vengeful ideas as a joke. At least, they have not surrendered to anyone. Nor has Holland. Nor has any other country. Why? Because they do not know to whom they should surrender.",
                "European politicians seem to be laughing up their sleeves at Mr. Clemenceau, while they are playing his game of \"Should we give him up, or should we not give him up?\" Let me repeat that this trial idea is a good thing when the responsible ones are found. But the trial should not be before a court. It should be before the people and the punishment should not be banishment to some comfortable isle or peninsula. The guilty one should be sent to but one place: The lamp post!",
                "What crime did Wilhelm Hohenzollern commit? As far as I can see, none. He tried to bring his nation out of the war victorious. What did the officers of his army do? They fought for their country just as we did. To punish such as these would be vengeance and nothing more.",
                "What sort of crime did the Habsburgs commit? None, whatsoever. It does seem as though they committed a crime, against Hungary, which has been suppressed for centuries. The Hungarians were forced to go to war because of treaties made by the Habsburgs. If punishment should be inflicted on anyone, it should be the Habsburgs. But have they not been punished enough? This is an affair that concerns Hungary alone and no one else, not even the long-nosed politicians of France.",
                "I cannot see how the feeling of revenge which prompts this call for punishment can be directed toward Hungary, because it was there that war prisoners were treated the kindliest as evidenced by the fact that thirty per cent of them sought permission to make their homes within its boundaries after the war. I contrast this with the spirit of hate that existed within French prison camps toward the men of the central powers. I have never heard of any former prisoners who wanted to stay in that country after the war, have you? For this I blame the politicians who have blinded people.",
                "If it does happen that some one must be punished for the crime of war, the searchlight of justice should be turned on the acts of those politicians, who were busy before the conflict began and after it ended. They are the ones to be punished. They are the back-stabbing assassins of the nations. Mr. Clemenceau has committed the gravest of sins against the peace and welfare of the world by making secret treaties with vengeance as his motive.",
                "When he signed the Armistice under which the warring nations put down their arms with the precise stipulation that Mr. Wilson's fourteen points be carried out, did Mr. Clemenceau have any intention of carrying out even one point of this program? Previous and subsequent action on his part proved that he did not. That, in itself, is a crime against the people of the world.",
                "I know I am inviting argument in the following statement, but on the part of the central power the war was a war of defense against other European powers. That it developed into a world conquest is another matter. But at the beginning I can truthfully say and do believe that it was a stroke of defense for the central Allies. Defense against what, you ask me? Against French political schemers and insidious leaders, I will answer.",
                "My proof is very easily presented. Notice the number of secret treaties France negotiated before the war as brought out at the peace conference. While the central powers were accepting President Wilson's fourteen points, Mr. Clemenceau sent the Roumanians into Hungary to occupy and plunder. Was this not a crime, a punishable crime? These Roumanians would be there yet had not America put forth such strenuous efforts, and stook staunchly behind General Bandholtz in his efforts to put an end to these robberies. Talking about crimes against the peace of the world, I need not name the arch-criminal. I will leave it to your intelligence and sense of justice.",
                "When Mr. Clemenceau went out to get America's help, did he mention any of his secret treaties? He did not, because he knew he would not get America's help if he did. Another indictment against Mr. Clemenceau: dishonesty. When the American people found out about his policies, they turned their back on him, and would have nothing to do with his schemings.",
                "Permit me to make a prediction: Mr. Clemenceau's hysterical ambitions will never be realized. In the first place, America will never agree to such policies nor sanction such action; and in the second, the countries upon which he attempts, or his successors may attempt, to impose his policies can be counted on to resist to the last man. This is human nature and human nature is the same in a nation as in an individual.",
                "I am sure that the Hungarian nation, which has borne up under the policies of the Habsburgs for a thousand years, will continue to bear up under any burden. If the signs that point to the election of Archduke Joseph are true pointers, then Hungary will speedily take her place among the great nations of the world. I am sure that Joseph possesses the strength of character, the determination and the intelligence to lead his people to political and economic preeminence.",
                "As for Mr. Clemenceau, you mark my word, he will live to reap the harvest of his insane policies, and to rue the day he gave them birth. That I know!"

Pressed in upon all sides by her enemies, lacking food and fuel, the approaching peace seemed to be worse than all the horrors of the unfortunate War. Her ancient territory taken from her, stripped of all her economic wealth, tied down with old debts, she could not resign herself to be the broken shadow of her glorious, but stormy past.",

In this immense turmoil abroad, the heart and soul of the American people responded to defend the cause. America understands the sad plight of Hungary, and places the blame where it belongs. To illustrate this point, I refer to two of our greatest exponents of American public opinion: The Chicago Daily Tribune, and the New York World. The first representing western thought, and the second,eastern reflection. The former representing the Republican anti- administration sentiment, the latter the Democratic pro-administration sentiment. Both great in their influence, and outspoken in their views, the consensus of opinion of both papers is surprisingly uniform, fair-minded, and just on the question of this new Hungarian revolution. They do not condemn Hungary for declaring war again, and joining the Russian Bolshevik movement, but they clearly point to the French imperialistic tendencies, and to the outrageous claims of Hungary's surrounding enemies, the Czechoslovaks, the Serbians, and the Rumanians, as the undermining momentum which caused the explosion in Hungary.",

In this message were utterances of great importance, and predictions which, for the most part came true. For this reason, and for the unshakable confidence the former governor of Hungary had expressed in the sense of justice of this nation and for its bitter attack on Austria, vassal of Germany.",
                "While writing in this country, the great leader for liberty first described events as they happened, and asserted that Austria had fought against the Hungarians not only with arms, and with the aid of traitors, but with diabolical plans and unceasing slander.",
                "Louis Kossuth addressed the American people in this manner: \"Free citizens of America! You have given in spite of this slander your fullest sympathy to my country. Oh that you had been the neighboring nation, the Old World would now be free, and you would not be forced to endure those terrible \"convulsions\" again, and cross rivers of \"blood\" which are inevitable. But the end is with God, and he will choose the means to fulfill his purpose.\"",

Be forever banished, you terrible traitor to the nation!\"",
                "The disruption of a centralized Austrian empire is predicted as follows: \"The sentiment of sympathy for our sufferings will inspire among the smaller states and race the wish for a fraternal confederation for that which I always urged as the only safe policy and guarantee of freedom for all of them.",

Her weakness is betrayed. The world does no longer believe that it needs the preservation of this decoyed empire. It is evident that its existence is a curse to the welfare of society. Among all the races of the empire, there is none that does not despair the reigning family of Hapsburgh. When the empire falls, not a tear of regret will follow it to its grave, and it will surely fall. A shot fired from an American or English vessel from the Adriatic would be like a trumpet at the city of \"Jericho.\"",
                "Describing the sentiment in this country some fifty years ago, Kossuth writes the following: \"The President of the United States in whom the confidence of a few people have elevated to the loftiest station in the world, in his message to Congress announced that the American government would have been the first to recognize the independence of Hungary. And the Senators and Representatives in Congress marked the destroyers of the liberty of my country with stigma of ignominy and expressed with indignant feelings their contempt for the conduct of Austria, and their wish to break diplomatic intercourse with that government.

This organization has been in existence for the past three weeks, and its power and strength was demonstrated by the large number of Hungarian people who turned out on their patriotic demonstration day. This last meeting and demonstration day has never been excelled by any Hungarian organization in the United States.",

This organization was founded by the Hungarian people; their interests gave birth to the ideas of the Association, and these ideas will be carried out by it. This organization has shown the people of the United States that the Hungarian people are loyal--that their emotions, thoughts, and actions are governed by loyalty. This organization believes that loyalty exists in the heart of every Hungarian, and that there is not a single Hungarian inhabitant of the United States who does not have reason for gratitude to this country.",

The duties of Hungarian-American citizens are the same as the duties of those who are native-born citizens of this country. Those Hungarian-Americans who are not citizens should also be loyal to this country, for by taking part in this war the United States is fighting for world democracy, a cause which should be championed by every nation, in order to make the world safe for democracy and peace.",

The Hungarian people, however, are not free. They are governed by the country's capitalists, who for their own protection have forced Hungary into the war. The same persons who forced the Hungarian nation into war are the ones who oppressed the Hungarian people. It is the duty of the Association to acquaint the people with the facts of the war and the objectives for which the United States is striving.",
                "As far as this organization knows, no Hungarian organization has ever explained the intricacies of the war. Therefore the Hungarian Patriotic Association has been organized with this idea in mind. The Association has a great future, although now it is only a state-wide organization with Chicago as its local headquarters.",
                "This organization was built up by the Chicago Hungarians in order that the Hungarian people might show their appreciation as a group toward the United States. The Hungarian people in Chicago are fully satisfied that the United States is fighting to free all humanity from a reign of tyranny. This organization does not believe in suppressing the facts of the war, but will take every opportunity to present a true account of the conflict.",
                "With this cultural work in mind, the Association will gain the confidence of the Hungarian people in their fight for liberty through the Hungarian-Americans. The Hungarians in the United States will fight for the victory of the United States; they will understand that Hungary would be fighting for the same cause that the United States is fighting for, if the German Junkers were not the overpowering rulers of Hungary.",

The loyalty of the Hungarian league is without any conscience and rests exclusively on the servile feeling. We must not be loyal from a sense of humiliation or from gratitude as the Hungarian league proclaims, but from the conviction that the United States defends, in fact world justice so many times offended by Germany, and her allies. These latter powers have oppressed and abused small nations in selfish and universally dangerous political interests, and justice requires that the crimes committed by Germany against the other nations be punished.",
                "So I am not loyal because the Hungarians are permitted to continue their work. The government of the United States did not even prevent the Germans from working. I am not loyal because the Hungarians did not have to register, as the Germans had to do. It would not be a cause for disloyalty. I am not loyal because the independence of Hungary depends exclusively upon the victory of the United States as stated by the loyalty league.",
                "All these are false pretexts to loyalty, the teaching of which does not serve the purpose of educating the masses of Hungarian Americans, who in Hungary and here are influenced by the Hungarian Junkers who are allies of the German Junkers. The Hungarians need to become free thinking men who are able to understand that it is in common interest to humanity to crush the rule of the European Junkers, and that this is especially in the interest of those who suffered under this system.",
                "Without any view of my citizenship, I am loyal because America did not require this war. Germany pressed it upon America with provocations and deeds, face slapping every international law. During the first three years of the war Hungarian Americans were taught that the responsibility for the war did not rest on Germany and her allies, that was British propaganda, against the French and Italians because they did not lay their arms down before the Germans. They stopped this, but that alone does not satisfy me.",
                "I expected the loyalty league to restore with educational work the sympathetic feeling which the Hungarians have always felt for the French,British,and Italians. It would be a very easy task, only it must be explained that the war is caused by Germany. The wrongs committed by the Germans towards the other nations must be shown. If the loyalty league would do this educational work, to disrupt every ideological, psychological communication between the Hungarian Americans and the German Imperialist. If the loyalty league influenced by this higher view would put in the mind of the Hungarian American the principles laid down by President Wilson, I would join as a member of the league without any hesitation, but I am not the man to deny the real cause to confess loyalty with pretexts, helping with it to cover the truth from the American Hungarians.",

It is the duty of every American citizen to protect his country. Only American citizens are being drafted into the Army, but every man regardless of citizenship will be required to register.",

It does not seem necessary to warn the Hungarian citizens in this country of the importance of registering, because they all know that laws in this country are not considered as a joking matter. Now we must consider the Hungarians who are not citizens of the United States. They must register also, although they are not required to serve in the Army.",

No one should think that if they postpone their registration, the government will not catch up with them. When the offenders are caught no excuses will be accepted whether a man is a citizen of this country or not. The penalty for the offense of not registering is one year in jail, and this penalty can not be escaped by the payment of a fine.",

                "On November 4, Calvin Coolidge was elected President of the United States by a big majority, and at the same time, the majority of Republican candidates were also elected to office.",
                "Since we love America deeply, we hope that this election will mean peace, happiness, prosperity, and generally speaking, good times, for the people and the country. But still with all this we have more to say about the results of the election.",
                "Outside of the victor, we have two \"dead\" individuals with whom we must deal. We cannot bury these people with simple ceremonies and an ordinary farewell, because this incident is of great importance.",
                "We must have the bisecting (sic) knife of a doctor to carefully analyze the importance of this election, and the powers of the people in wielding it.",
                "Calvin Coolidge became a presidential candidate without much effort on his part. He was well behaved in the political circles, so the Republicans selected him unanimously as their presidential candidate.",
                "Coolidge is not a bad fellow. He is a Puritan, he is sincere, respectable, plain, and a North American type of a man.",
                "He has kept his truly great possibilities a secret. Probably in the next four years we will see the greatness of this man. Maybe time will reveal a great man? It looks as though he will be good to the American people, even after he defeated two very prominent men: John W. Davis and Robert M. LaFollette.",
                "Now we can say without partiality and without campaigning that John W. Davis was the man best fitted and qualified for the presidency of the United States. It seems as though Davis had prepared his entire life in such a way that would fit him to be the President of this great Union some day. He advanced step by step with high respect, and with truly great intelligence he represented all. He was a representative of the people, and through his various achievements he reached the highest goal. He has broad experiences in diplomatic circles, and is well versed with Democratic activities. But all this did not impress the people.",
                "The other candidate was LaFollette. His entire life was devoted to the public, and he was a fighter for the welfare of his people. He fought the big heads and individuals who were against the working people. In his own State, Wisconsin, as a law maker and Governor, he fought bitterly against graft in politics and for improved conditions for the people of his State.",
                "While serving in the Senate, the trusts and big capitalists were afraid of him. He is seventy years old. Probably this was the draw back. His talent, his experience, and his interest in the welfare of his people are far above the ability of Coolidge, and still the people did not cast their ballots for him.",
                "To compare the three platforms is useless. The Republicans are conservative. The Democrats are liberals, and the followers of LaFollette are the more radical type. But the people were impressed by the conservative type. Davis and LaFollette openly declared themselves against the Klan.",
                "Coolidge showed a rather independent attitude towards the Klan. There are those who believe that Coolidge is a strong believer of the principles of the Ku Klux Klan. And yet there were millions of colored people, millions of Catholics, and even millions of immigrants who voted for him. Disregarding the Klan, these people were impressed by the Republican party and Coolidge. These people must be happy now that their hopes have come true. The reactionary leaders of the Ku Klux Klan are riding high and fast throughout the nation. The people voted for a full kettle of meat.",
                "Prosperity and a threat of economic disturbances forced the people to vote the way they did. The present unemployment and unsettled economic conditions scared the short-sighted, spineless ones. Setting all intelligence aside, and all the other soul-stirring matters, these people believed the sweet words and flattery of the campaigners. They believed that the banks would close for the next four years, that the furnaces in the steel mills would shut down, they believed that coal and iron ore mines would cease operating, in other words, they believed that the entire industrial world would come to a standstill if Coolidge were not elected.",
                "The workers of industrial organizations applauded LaFollette. Davis was met with high acclaim, but when voters stepped into the voting booths, eighteen million voted for Coolidge. LaFollette was branded as a \"Red\" through and through by the Republicans, and this proved to be the fact that made his campaign such a failure. They could not find much fault with Davis, so they claimed that if he were elected there would be a panic, because Wall Street only favors the Republican party. Where is the logic? Where will this end?",
                "It was the people, these cultured people, who took all this in and believed it. The millions of people who were entrusted with the work of the Republican party did their work very well. The strength of propaganda can not be figured under conditions existing today. The one who becomes victorious is the one who has the greatest amount of money to spend on propaganda and this will either enlighten or fool the people, depending upon how intelligently it is used.",
                "We must admit that the Republicans knew how to use the method of propaganda and at the same time they had enough money to publicize and spread their ideas. Clear thinking, satisfaction, advancement, and the future, seem to be secondary. The important items seem to be the meat kettle, money, and tobacco. They have forgotten about those who deprived the people of their rights and other faithless representatives,among whom, Fall, Daugherty, Denby, and their activities are not thought of.",
                "Every damaging veto made by Coolidge was forgiven on November 4, and their motto became: \"Re-elect Coolidge, because he will be the one to bring good times.\"",
                "To the girls, silks; the boys, Fords; the fathers, radios; and the mothers, the movies. This is what the people want.",
                "Many years ago, in the days of the Roman Empire, when it was at its height, the easygoing and thoughless people asked their emperor for bread and a circus. They received both. But this powerful Roman Empire met its downfall.",
                "If the American people are looking for ordinary good times, movies, etc., at the time of election, then this great nation, which was formed under the leadership of Washington and Jefferson, will meet the same fate of Rome.",
                "This presidential election meant a backward step, and not one that will advance us, as it would have happened if Davis or La Follette had been elected.",
                "We hope we are false prophets, and that the election of Coolidge and Dawes will be the beginning of a more liberal form of people's rights. We hope this from the bottom of our hearts, but we will not lose sight of them.",
                "Since Coolidge is our President, even though we did not vote for him, we sincerely beg of him to talk to Morgan, Gary, Mellon, and others belonging to the Republican group, so that they can start the train of prosperity and good times, because we, the working people, could use some of it now. We are tired of old Republican promises, high cost of living, and unemployment. These conditions exist throughout the nation, and we are getting tired of it all."

The reason he gives for this condition is that the Cook County Jail is filled to more than capacity. The jail was built to accommodate five hundred and twenty people and at present there are eight hundred and twenty occupants. The crime rate has risen so fast that the sheriff will have to provide for more than twelve hundred prisoners within a very short time. But there is no room at the present time to take care of these criminals; arrangements are being made, whereby the criminals will be rounded up and there will be enough room for them all.

When the time came to collect, the policy proved to be nothing but a one dollar railroad ticket.

We are the ones who have to think about the future, of what will happen to us in case of sickness or death!

                "Everyone knows that a great change has taken place in the economic and social activities of Europe and the United States during the past hundred years. The working conditions of women were naturally affected by these changes. Their educational and political status also underwent great changes during this period. Up to the end of the nineteenth century, women's duties were confined to the home; they did their work the same way that they had been doing it for many hundreds of years previously. The upkeep of the home was left to the various members of the family. The care of the home, and the care of the children were the primary duties of the housewife. These duties took up most of her time. Business played a very unimportant part in man's life during this period. The necessities of life were provided for by man's own labor and by nature. Educational opportunities in those days as compared with today were almost negligible. The girls learned their domestic knowledge at home. In those days regardless of to what social class a girl belonged, it was impossible for her to go to a university in order to prepare herself for a professional position. In most countries the women could not assume a position lawfully in government circles.",
                "The citizenship status of women was not considered any more than was that of a child. A woman could not make a contract. She could not sue anyone nor could she be sued by anyone. If she committed a crime, the husband or the father was held responsible. A wife could not own property. She had very few rights over her children. If a woman worked for a salary, the salary automatically became the property of her husband.",
                "With the opening of the present century however, a great change took place. Large factories sprang up in every field of manufacture, and machines were invented to make working conditions easier; girls and women were hired to run these machines. Cities and small towns became industrial centers where men, women and even children made their way to work to make their own living. As industry developed, the people became specialized in certain fields of work. As this change came about, some of the women realized that they were as capable in the business world as were the men. They opened places of business and hired women for sales jobs. As women went into business, the realization developed slowly that they were highly suitable for office positions. As time went on, the younger girls were attracted to the business and factory world where they would work from the time they left school until they got married.",
                "With the opening of the era of women in industry, different countries realized that laws had to be enacted which would protect women against long hours and other hazardous conditions. As women became more and more involved in industry and business, laws were enacted which enabled them to acquire education on the same basis as men. However, in European countries cultural education among women is stressed more than anything else.",
                "There isn't a country in the world which affords the educational opportunities to men and women that the United States does. It has been these educational opportunities which have made it possible for women to become doctors and other specialized workers.",
                "The status of women has changed legally and politically. In different countries different changes have taken place, but what we think is the most important is that women got the right to vote. Norway was the first country to grant suffrage to women. With this change came the right of women to represent the people in parliament, congress or other governmental activities.",
                "There are still countries where women have not gained the right to vote. But in these countries, the women are up in arms and are demanding their rights, which is no more than just. Women are as capable as men in most instances, and therefore they should have the same rights.",
                "The purpose of this article is that we want our people to become acquainted with the social activities of the women of America. We want our Chicago Hungarian readers to know how the women advanced step by step. We want our women to realize the educational opportunities they have. We want them to know what opportunities await them in the business world or in the field of politics.",
                "We think that as long as these opportunities exist, women should take advantage of them."

The climate also has the advantage of evenness, because South Carolina has a long coast line and the Gulf Stream affects it favorably.

This figure is amazing, and it means that we, as a civilized nation, must do something about this situation. According to baby specialists in the medical field, the death rate among babies can be lowered. This terrible death rate among babies must awaken society to realize that it must be stopped. We all know or should know that in order that a child may be healthy, the mother must receive proper care before and after the child is born, and the child in turn must receive proper medical care when it is born and proper parental care after it is born. The above-mentioned things are the only means by which we, as a human and civilized race, can save yearly a quarter of a million babies.",

The aid of every person is needed to help lower this death rate. We Hungarians are especially concerned because the birth rate per family amongst us seems to be a little higher than the average.",

He has been acclaimed by American critics and we hope that in the future the Hungarians will appreciate his talents and patronize him in much greater numbers.",

The story of the operetta appeared in one of our recent issues, so that we will limit our report to a description of the achievements of the performers.",

Her part as a mother who sacrifices herself for the sake of her loved children, always keeping their happiness before her eyes, was excellent. The public rewarded its beloved artist with almost never ending applause.",

We can conscientiously say that she has won her battle with brilliant success, and appeared on the stage as an accomplished artist, which, expressed in other words, would mean that a new star has arisen on the firmament of the Hungarian Theater. With her graceful appearance, charming and well-disciplined acting she has earned a complete success, and we hope to have more occasion to enjoy the acting of this young artist.",
                "The role of \"Andrew Ban de Belezna\" was played by Simi Varga, an extremely talented actor. Ban de Belezna, a Hungarian aristocrat, was almost a chauvinist in his love and admiration of everything Hungarian. The excellent arrangement, as well as the painstaking coaching received by the players in their roles, goes also to his credit. We have to thank Simi Varga for this delightful performance, as it was thanks to his efforts and his artistic taste that the public could enjoy such a charming evening.",

Laci Racz XXXVI and his orchestra took hold of the audience with their beautiful playing, just like they had done at the first concert, and those present enjoyed the solos and ensembles.",

Yet, we must say that the people did not get the kind of performance that the price they had paid for the tickets called for. Naturally, we do not insinuate that Laci Racz failed to give us all we were expecting from him; on the contrary, he gave us more than we were entitled to expect--he and his band played better than we had anticipated.",

At this time Benjamin Ehrlich, an attorney, appeared, saying that he was Beck's best friend and he demanded that an inquest be made to find out whether Beck wasn't poisoned. Ehrlich said that the night before his death, Beck drank some wine at a party and complained soon after of illness. The funeral was postponed until Dec. 27.",

The Evening American critic, Glenn Dillard Gunn, wrote: \"At last we have an American girl whose stage artistry is far superior to any European artist I have ever seen.\" It was only natural that the Italian artists should correct him, and inform him that Ann Roselle was a Hungarian. To our joy, he apologized and corrected himself in his next article.",

Many of us remember back seven years ago when under the direction of Frank Palasthi, the New York Hungarian theatrical Society playeu at the old Globe Theatre. The name of the play was \"The Count Of Luxemburg\". It was at this time that Ann Gyenge made her first appearance. We knew then that in a short time she would become one of the foremost artists of the stage. She has been with the Metropolitan Opera Company which is one of the best-known companies in the world.",

                "His program consisted of selected works of the celebrated composers, Corelli, Tartini, Schubert, Sarasate and Pazanim.",
                "At 8 o'clock the audience had thronged into the hall and occupied their seats. When at 8:15 the hall became dark, all eyes turned to the stage, and with bated breath, those present awaited the appearance of the great artist. In the background of the stage, the door suddenly opened and there appeared the portly young Hungarian Artist. The audience burst into a storm of applause, lasting four minutes.",
                "Kerekyarto, our dear artist, placed the violin to his chin and began playing \"La Folia,\" by Corelli. The instant he began to play, the audience was carried away by the strains of the violin. We saw only one violin, but it seemed a whole orchestra was playing. Kerekyarto is a young man, but as an artist surpasses the popular older violin virtuoso's of the present time.",
                "While Kerekyarto was playing, the mind of the audience was roaming far away in a fairy land, among vari-colored beautiful flowers, where there is no worry, no misery, and where everybody is happy.",
                "The proverb says that the \"criticism of the people decides.\" Regarding the art of Kerekyarto, the people decided his greatness, because after every number the audience applauded wildly, and the great Hungarian artist was called three or four times to appear before the curtains. Everybody was applauding; everybody was paying homage to the technique of the great artist.",
                "His talent manifested itself especially in the \"Nightingale\"; the audience imagined itself in a fairy forest listening to the sweet songs of birds. Only when they glanced at the artist, did they realize they were in a theatre, and that the pleasant tunes were coming from Kerekyarto's violin.",
                "At the concert, the Magyars were present in imposing numbers. We saw quite a few prominent Magyars who enjoyed the playing of our eminent artist and shared the triumphal success of Hungarian art. We never expected that Hungarian art would be the great success in America Kerekyarto made it.",
                "Toward the end of the program, the Magyars of the audience, as if united by the same thought, all cried at once, \"Magyart!\" (A Hungarian!\"). Kerekyarto, with double ardor and \"Magyar heart,\" played a number by Hubay, which was tremendously applauded, not only by Hungarians, but by the rest of the audience.",
                "After the concert many of the Magyars congratulated the young artist, who received them with warm friendship."

The outstanding actors who took part in this operetta were as follows: Michael Redey, a former member of the Budapest opera company, and Miss Irma Petrovics, former Hungarian actress. The performance of Mr. Redey was superb. But we think it necessary to say that his performance put real life into the performance of this operetta. He acted so well that when he appeared on the scene we forgot that it was merely an act, and not a true life happening. This is not taking anything away from the performance of the other actors, who all performed in the finest way possible.",

I am taking back the following operettas, \"The Song Has Ended,\" \"The Singing Captain,\" \"The Countess Maritza,\" \"The Sun Is Shining,\" and many other interesting plays which have been successfully produced in Hungary, and I feel that these plays and operettas will find their way into the hearts of the Hungarian Americans. In Chicago we have taken upon ourselves great cultural responsibilities, among which are the development of the Hungarian press, the popularization of Hungarian literature and the making of Hungarian music more accessible to the Hungarian public.",

It is not a small job for us poor Hungarians to struggle there among strangers, but everyone over there is striving to keep the Hungarian language alive, even though the distance from the fatherland is so great.'\""

Both actors and actresses have promised to do their best in giving the finest performances on the stage. Our beloved Louis Hegedus, after expressing great happiness over this turn of affairs, said that not only is the old guard together again, but the followers of Heltay will still pack the theatres along the entire route of the company.",

M. in automobiles that rivaled in beauty with each other. The crowd around the theatre was so impressive that it drew the attention of hundreds of passers-by. The writer of this article heard an intelligent American ask of persons in the crowd the cause of the enormous gathering. Upon being told, he remarked, \"Oh, the Hungarian is an art-loving people.\"",

This caused him to declare that he will never bring his company to Chicago again. Later, he said, his company may return to Chicago, after four or five months, where it will give matinee performances to cover expenses.",
                "The Hungarians of Chicago can fill to capacity any theatre twice a month, but not on consecutive days of the week. If the performances were held every two weeks, the plan to have a permanent Hungarian theater would be successful.",
                "We know now that it is impractical to give performances on succeeding days of the week and expect capacity audiences. So, therefore, we cannot expect to gain anything by holding matinee and evening performances the same day. The few reasons that make this an impossibility are:",
                "First, the Hungarian Colony in Chicago does not live in any one central location as a group. They are spread out over the entire city and suburbs, and not as in New York City, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh, where they are grouped together in a certain section of the city. Because of this, in order for a Hungarian to attend a matinee performance, he must leave his home before noon. To attend the evening performance, he must leave his home way before supper time and eat in strange restaurants, which he detests.",
                "The theatrical productions in New York, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh, are given on alternate Sunday evenings and draw capacity audiences. Second, because of the tremendous expense involved in travel to Chicago from New York, Pittsburgh, or Cleveland, it would be impossible to bring the Company here just for one performance and then have it return to the East.",
                "Here is where the conflict starts in this business. Every time a manager for a reputable visiting Hungarian troupe from Hungary approached Bela Szende in order to include his cast in Szende's, or to ask him to sponsor a different production, he was not permitted to make any headway on his mission of progressive cultural functions. Szende quieted him by saying that his company was an entertaining troupe of the stage on business, not on an artistic or cultural mission. Taking into consideration the position and the conditions of life of the actors and actresses while on a road tour, no one could expect artistic and cultural performances. They have to keep traveling without any stop-offs, performing in a different city every day, on platforms three feet long and two feet deep, in stinking places. They must haul heavy luggage with them continually. They have no decent regular hours to eat or sleep. As far as the question of productions with extemporaneous tawdry parts are concerned, the audience's preference leans more towards this form of entertainment than towards the parts of the play with musical or literary beauty.",
                "In writing this article, we have stepped on the toes of the leaders of theatrical productions. This is because the production of fine arts was stimulated by rotten tawdry bits of performances, causing a contest between the theatrical producers, who soothingly tried to outdo each other in their fine arts.",
                "Now that the theatrical production company will not come back to Chicago, we feel that the good, old-time fine arts players should step forward with a progressive program. Let the old tried leaders of the fine arts productions step forward. Among us in Chicago lives one of the greatest of leaders, and managers of fine arts productions that ever lived in Hungary, Michael Redey. He is also an excellent fine arts player. We can feel positively certain that Redey will form his company from the good old-time fine arts players, and will give such a good performance that the Chicago Hungarians will be indemnified for the loss of the other production.",
                "Here in distant West Pullman, the old-time fine arts players regained consciousness and stood ready to obey the orders of the veteran leader, as did Louis Irsza. The rehearsals for the production of \"Ordog Matkaja\" (Devil's Bride), are progressing rapidly and with the greatest enthusiasm. We know how Louis Irsza has struggled for many years, in West Pullman, to produce fine arts productions. To his name is credited, the success of many excellent performances. Like the aged warrior who after much struggle finds himself facing a disillusioned end, the developers of our fine arts again turn against the old guard. This stimulates a contest with the youthful players ... Our faithful old time leaders will not stain the Hungarian literary theatrical productions with vulgar parts that cause audiences to blush with shame. Our artists shall perform as the author wrote the story, according to Hungarian literary style."

                "The monster Hungarian benefit concert held Saturday, November 22, at the Apollo Theater, with the participation of some first-class American, Ukrainian, and Mexican artists, was a great success. Those who are always trying to find fault will perhaps object to the presence of non-Hungarian artists in a concert, advertised as purely Hungarian. It would be a waste of time to debate this point with people who most probably were not even present at this unforgettable performance, the memory of which will always be marred by the fact that certain social classes did not look at this benefit with much sympathy. There is no reason for such an attitude, and the Hungarian reputation was endangered in this manner by those who didn't accept the invitation of the Daily News, which was the sponsor of these series of concerts. The indifference of some Hungarians was amply counterbalanced by the zeal of those who are little in number but great in enthusiasm and unselfishness. This enthusiastic group of co-workers made this brilliant performance possible and by their effort enriched the Joint Emergency Fund, under the sponsorship of the Daily News, with more than six hundred dollars.",
                "For the masterly artistic arrangements, laurels are due to Alexander Radanovits, professor of singing, and his wife, Marishka Young-Radanovits, former prima-ballerina of the Vienna Opera House. Thanks to their effort, the concert could boast of such first-class artists as those composing the Ukrainian Mixed Choir and the Mexican Band, not to mention the American violinists and pianists who played a number of compositions by Hungarian authors. These artists received no remuneration for their services. As to the Hungarian part of the evening, it must be admitted that never before in our history here in Chicago did the Hungarians give a show that could surpass this one in enthusiasm. This is the unanimous opinion of the large audience, whose applause at times resembled the thunder of an organ."

The fate of the Hungarians is akin to that of the Silver Bird. This proud bird followed the Magyars from the plains of Asia and made its home in the swamps of Ecsed.

                "It is due to the unsurpassed artistic sense of Joseph B. Mayer that he succeeded in bringing this piece to the stage in such precise arrangement, such excellent rendering, such careful distribution of roles, and in such beautiful stage setting. Certainly in this latter task he was assisted by the Singing Circle, which did not spare any sacrifice to offer the public the best possible performance. Next to Mayer's share in bringing this play to such success, is that of the performers, who did their best in making the play a success by their artistic accomplishment and so have the right to share the laurels too.",

She played the role of \"Lina,\" the divorcee, with a temperament that only an Irene Klacsman can possess. Her acting was so realistic that for a moment the audience feared that this temperamental woman would in fact use the double-barreled shotgun she held in her hands. It is only natural that she would reap great success once again, just as she always did in the past whenever she appeared on the stage.",
                "Charles Csajaghy surpassed all his previous stage successes in his skillful rendering of an obstinate Hungarian landowner, whose will could not be disputed but who at last succumbed to the demands of the heart and became a lamb in the hands of his second wife. The public rewarded him with well-merited applause.",

Those who came could see for themselves how well this School had taught the new generation to become good Catholics and useful and loyal American citizens. It was apparent to all present that these youths will not forget the land of their ancestors and will never be ashamed of their origin.",
                "The program of the festival was really very good. After the class of ten girls and eleven boys had sung its farewell song, Margaret Grand, speaking for her classmates, thanked the teachers and parents for their interest and efforts. In his commencement address Reverend Ernest Horvath advised the graduates to apply themselves with renewed zeal to the course of their future, and then he presented the class with their diplomas. Reverend Horvath also commended the parents of the graduates for their sacrifices in making possible the education of their children.",
                "Especially nice was the Minuet of the little tots; they tiptoed hither and yon with sweet childish uncertainty, clad in droll crinoline and white wigged. The uniformed boys' troops very cleverly staged a mimic baseball play, then the sixth and seventh grade boys marched in and captured the attention of the audience with their Hungarian songs, during which three groups of the girls, clad in red, white, and green formed very attractively the Hungarian National Flag. But probably the best part of the program was the \"Dream of the Hungarian Child,\" in which the enemies of great Hungary tore apart the territory of Hungary, each stealing a part of it, but in the end the Almighty God made them give back to Hungary all the territories they had stolen from her.",
                "The last number on the program was a dramatic presentation which was most remarkable because all of the girls who played in it spoke the Hungarian language with astonishing clearness.",
                "The credit for the success of the School, which was reflected in this festival, belongs to Reverend Ernest Horvath, and to the teachers of the School, the Holy Sisters, in whose bosoms beat real Hungarian hearts, and who must have worked more than their share to attain such success."

He is willing to put a certain number of police-horses at the disposition of the arranging committee. The arranging committee asks all those, who know how to ride a horse, - in the first line those who as soldiers served with the hussars, or who were Csiko's (cowboys) in the old country, - to make application in such number, that a detachment of at least fifteen riders could be formed. As there is an opportunity, to show ourselves in one of our better capacities, we must bring out only first class things, therefore,only such ones should apply for participation in this mounted band, who really know how to ride, and under whom the horse will feel, that it has a Hungarian horsemen on its back. We know on another occasion in the past, a group of horsemen were carried by their mounts just like so many sacks of flours, showing that their horsemanship instructions had been gotten in dreams. Such things ought not to happen again.",

We need also, someone who has been a bugler with the cavalry. Let us apply, therefore, in great number, and try to enlist such Hungarians, as are sure of being able to perform as well as a Hungarian horseman should perform.",

Hungarian Social and Sick Benefit Association of Chicago and Suburb did for weeks and even months. On Whit-Sunday there was not room enough to harbor all the crowd of the Hungarians of Chicago and vicinity, who came together on this occasion. Even from other states the Hungarians gathered together to participate in this festival. As we know it, there were guests even from California, Los Angeles, whom the noted Hungarian painter,Emil Fellegi, sent to Chicago to witness this Hungarian gathering, so as to be able to tell the Hungarians of California, how it was done.",
                "At about 3:00 P.M. began the gathering of the different associations. First to arrive was the German-Hungarian Ladies Sick-Benefit Association whose members appeared clad in their white uniforms, bearing their color, under the leadership of Mrs. Mary Acker, president. There were also other uniformed groups, as that of the Woodmen of the World, Branch No. 317; many brought their flags along, like the Chicago Youth and Amateur Club, the 164th Branch of the Verhovay Aid Association, the Rakoczi Sick Benefit Association, Independent Hungarians Association, Chicago Literary and Singing Association. There were further delegations of the branches 221st and 57th of the Bridgeport Aid Association, the Chicago Ladies Benevolent Association, the South Side Hungarian Reform Church, the Hungarian Society, the Federation of Hungarian Churches and Societies of Chicago South Side, etc.",
                "With the branch 221st of Bridgeport Aid Association came also the district director, John Kovacs, who delivered during the festival a very nice greeting speech in the name of the greater associations.",

John Balazs, President,greeted the public,then giving the stage to Paul Timko, who in the past was often president of the Jubilant Association and in his speech related the events during the forty-five years of existence of the association.",
                "Next on the program came the songs of Miss Adrienne Szegedy,accompanied by her sister, Alice Szegedy. Then came the dedication of the flag, the present flag of Hungary. The church ceremonies were performed by Rev. George Thegze, Hungarian Greek-Catholic Priest, followed by a speech by the Rev. Gero Garay of the Hungarian Reform Church in South Chicago about the significance of the flag in general and of this flag in particular. The flag was dedicated by the honorable Ladistaus Medgyessy, the Royal Hungarian Consul, who then presented it to its god-parents, Mr. and Mr. J.Szidak. They, together with the honorary President, Coloman Molnar, became the guardians of the flag, and solemnly they vowed to take good care of it always.",
                "After the act of dedication those present were photographed, and then the program was continued. According to the program, the next number should be the singing and the dance of the \"Prima-Donna\" of Burnside,\" who was nobody else than the seven year old daughter, Betty Lou, of the Louis Nimeths'. The girl earned a tremdous ovation through her performance. She was accompanied on the piano by Miss Irenke Marossy, recorder of the Tarsalgo. In the name of the South Side Federation of Hungarian Churches and Associations, Joseph Barceli, the President, presented good wishes to the Hungarians from Chicago's South Side. Irenke Sinko recited with great success an English poem, written for this occasion by the lyrist of Bihar.",
                "As the stage was to small, the dance numbers of the Dancing Group of Chicago Hungarian Youth and Amateur Club was shown in the second, the dance part of the festivals. Of the two dances, the Palotas received great applause from the public, and was performed by the dancing group with real grace. This success is also due in part, to their dance instructor, John Petri.",
                "In the meantime the drinks were served lavishly, and the supper was in full swing in the dining-room. But since the Arrangement Committee planned for only about eight-hundred dinners, that number only could be served. However, there were no complaints about anybody being left hungry, because there was an abundance of sausage and all kinds of eatables.",
                "In the ballroom the dancers were happily dancing till sunrise. Everybody who was there had a good time celebrating this memorable festival of the Tarsalgo."

                "p.11.............We Hungarians, whenever we happen on to a foreign map, a schoolbook, a coin or stamp collection, almost unconsciously turn to that part which deals with the details pertaining to Hungary or to the Hungarians. After the great world fire brand ,we are anxious to know what is the world's opinion about us. To satisfy curiosity of ours, we could not find any better place than that, where the different nations are lined up to exhibit their culture, their industry, art, their moral or physical strength. It is only natural, that such an event, as the participation of the Hungarians in the World's Fair, can leave no Hungarian uninterested.",
                "When we approach the vast exposition from the 23rd St. entrance bridge, in the shadows of the proud towers,there modestly hidden we find the Hungarian Pavillon, on top of which flutters in the air the Hungarian flag, the sight of which lifts our heart and soul high above the stone and steel structures of the city. We live in a free country, where the wind plays with the red, white and green of Hungary just so as with all the other nations colors. In the life of the Hungarian-Americans the Hungarian colors are not rare guests, but this flag is something different; it is the flag of a very great association-that of fourteen million Hungarians. We raise hats when we notice it, and uncover again before we enter the pavilion. The foreigners first enter into the rooms marked \"Hungary\" and when they learn to know their native land from the materials exhibited therein, they may give the salute due our tricolor when they come out.",
                "But, is it possible to parade all the culture of a country on such limited space? Why, certainly, it is. And what is more remarkable, we offer more than those imitations of cities, made of paper, and which, in some cases only misrepresent their countries. That which is offered in those \"villages\" are neither folk-art, nor national life, nor even art, which would satisfy even a medium class public. They are built with an eye to the weary visitor, who after a prolonged sight-seeing walk hardly can keep himself on his feet. He will greet a chair to sit on if for the price of 25 cents he can see something, provided it does not happen too often that he is obliged to pull out some change to pay for something or other. The programs are intentionaly short ones, so the visitors should have time, to buy something in the selling stalls of these stage wall houses.",
                "How much better it is to know, that there were no attempts to make any paper-Hortobagy, where some overworked comedian would impersonate the Hungarian peasant. No pure blooded Hungarian would stoop so low as to dance for money in his unique Csiko's costume. On the contrary, every visitor is free to come, to study and if he wishes, to buy something in the Hungarian Pavilion, where there is no entrance fee to be paid. In our modest, almost conspicuously simple pavilion there was a color display, which would put to shame that of Fableland. I do not refer simply to the group of the many hundred little dolls clad in Hungarian costumes, which resemble so many flower-bouquets, but also to those pieces of folk-handicrafts which are worthy of being exhibited, and which are to be seen right next to the entrance, further inside the world renowned Zsolnay and Herendi-porcellains, which could stand all possible criticism and the like of which you cannot find in the whole exposition. The best authority on the Hungarian Folkarts, Mr. Victor Unterreiner,puts a whole collection before the eyes of the visitor. He selected out the market-pieces with the eyes of a good business man, as well, as those pieces, which have their places in the show-windows, thereby offering the opportunity both for the widening of our knowledge and for trade by selling some of the pieces to the customers. In his collection we can find the most beautiful pieces of the folk-arts of Buzsak, Mezokovesd, Sarkoz and other vicinities. He did not forget even the \"Arvalanyhaj.\" He has also some copper and color etchings, the works of some of the best Hungarian artists. It is also to his credit, that he succeeded to import a greater quantity of Hungarian wines. The importance of this is hardly necessary to strees. It was high time, that the world's best and most famous wine should reach the American market. I was astounded to hear, there is on the market some kind of a wine, under the name, \"Canadian Tokay\" but can not understand, how they can use that name. In the Hungarian Pavilion one can find besides the Tokay wine of 1916 vintage also the Hungarian Champagne Togley.",
                "Maybe there are many of us who did not know, that in the last years the Hungarian tobacco industry and especially that of the cigars, gained world fame. In England, the best cigars are of Hungarian origin, and France takes a considerable quantity of tobacco from Hungary every year. The Hungarian Tobacco Monopoly sent out Dr. Joseph Vizsolyi, to represent the Hungarian tobacco on the World's Fair. He also represents the Hungarian Tourist Department, the beautiful posters and photographs of which are real decorations to the Hungarian Pavilion, and which are teaching about the culture of our less known native country, and the character of Budapest as a health resort.",
                "The foreign hunters left much money in Hungary during the last few years, for the privilege of shooting some big game. The hunting association \"Hubertus\" took care to call the attention of the American hunters to the hunting possibilities in our old country.",
                "Elmer Nagy, the engineer-jeweler had a valuable collection of masterpieces of the old-Hungarian jewelers' art. The exhibition of the famous Gerbeau candies serve to show, that besides the Hungarian cook the Hungarian conditor is also first of his kind in the world.",
                "In one corner of the pavilion there is going on almost mechanically the painting of pictures for sale. Geza Vincze and Marras painters are \"creating\" with great speed. The former creates landscapes in five minutes, the latter makes colored portraits. Naturally under the given circumstances it is impossible to produce real art products. I have to mention another painter, Nicholas Gaspar, who painted all the reklame-pictures of one of the exhibition halls. He is a marvelous decorator and in one of his pictures, that of the harvest one could almost smell the air of the Hungarian Plain, the Alfold. The group of his pictures ends in an unfolded world map. On this map, my collegue, Gaspar accomplished that for which the Hungarians are hoping the revision of the Peace treaty. He simply cut off on the map a goodly portion from each of the neighboring countries and the territories so gained he added to Hungary, thereby making it as big almost as Germany is. Well, why should not the foreigners see that we have been, are now and will be always some bodies on this unfolded world globe.",

This irritated those who had paid for their seats but who had to stand because their seats had been taken and their occupants could not be ordered to give them up, since admission to the place was free. And in a free place, first come, first served.",

                "Though the Hungarians were present in great numbers, yet the Day looked like a ship without a pilot. This was evident right from the very beginning, proving that the Arranging Committee knew as little about the arrangement as a village blacksmith knows about chemistry.",

                "Would it not be much better if instead of the peasant wedding and harvest festival, Madach's \"The Tragedy of Man\" had been shown, supplemented with the events up to date, which could have been accomplished without any appreciable effort on our part?",

This has been carried so far that we fear the Hungarians will play no role at the Exposition. Just imagine, Hungary, one of the oldest and worthiest nations in the world, left out in the cold! It is with great satisfaction that we hear now that the Hungarians here at long last woke up and, through the Federation of Associations, will tell the world they are alive, and that Hungary is not dead but just sleeping. What role the Federation will play is at present not yet clear. The belated action of the Federation had been preceded by the action of the directors of the Hungarian radio hour in Hammond, who decided to present a radio hour of Hungarian songs and music to the millions visiting the Exposition. This action will in some measure counterbalance, so far as our reputation of cultured people is concerned, the negligence, partly due to our poverty and partly to our indifference, on the part of the Hungarians.",

                "New Year Day will for long remain a fond memory in the minds of the Hungarians living in the Calumet region, because on that day a record crowd attended the Hungarian Home to see the first Hungarian Radio Festival. The evening was an outstanding success, which proves the popularity of the Hungarian Radio Hour and speaks well of its skillful arrangement. This Radio Festival was arranged by Frank J. Kovach, director of the Hungarian Radio Hour over Station WIND in Gary, Indiana, who was aided in his work by the businessmen of Burnside and by the House Committee of the Hungarian Home. The festival was scheduled to start at six o'clock in the afternoon, and by that time the halls of the building were crowded to capacity. To facilitate listening to the program, the halls, on the two floors were provided with loudspeakers. The loudspeakers were of great service when the time to dance came, as the same music was heard in both halls, thus preventing any crowding, to the great satisfaction of the public. The program consisted of numbers by amateurs and the well-known cabaret Troupe headed by Louis Horvath, Jr., a gifted actor. The program was varied and rather long, and the public evidently enjoyed it very much.",
                "Frank J. Kovach, who acted as master of ceremonies, greeted the audience with a short speech, which he commenced with the same phrase he uses when he opens his Hungarian Hour: \"Good evening to all!\" The public rewarded him with thunderous applause.",
                "[Translator's Note: The article describes each number on the program, naming and praising each of the 76 performers, musicians, etc., and giving an account of how each of them played.]",
                "The festival lasted until the morning hours. The income of the evening will be used to make the Hungarian Radio Hour a permanent feature."

I recall the arrival of those newspapers in my town, the fifth biggest town in old Hungary, on the fast train, arriving at about 2 P.M. The local newspaper agency was at such times besieged by the would-be readers, who were almost fighting with each other for those papers. It was worthwhile, because there were many good and interesting things in those papers to read, not only advertisements. As I now turn over the leaves of the American Hungarian papers, to my sorrow, I am unable to find something worthwhile in them besides the advertisements of the distilleries , breweries, the undertakers, and the New Years Greetings of those politicians, who are preparing for the elections.",

There is no new generation, no new army of readers, and there won't be, because the number of immigrants coming from Hungary at the present time is insignificant. As for the American-born Hungarians--they don't want or need a Hungarian newspaper.",
                "Many of the old settlers have given up reading Hungarian newspapers, preferring the American papers. Also many old-timers have died; others ceased to subscribe because they couldn't afford it. The foregoing is the story in a nutshell about the decrease of subscribers.",
                "The loss of the advertisers came about in a similar, if not in exactly the same way. The important thing to the advertiser is the number of readers, and if circulation is on the decrease, the advertiser pays less for his ad or doesn't advertise at all.",

Still, some enterprising editors and publishers who thought that Hungarians must have a newspaper and--what is more important--that such a newspaper would be an excellent source of income, started one.",

But when these lean years arrived--the economic crash that we have all been feeling for the past two years--then the theory of the survival of the fittest became a reality.",

                "The Hungarian institutions must co-operate strictly with the Hungarian newspapers in America. By Hungarian institutions we mean churches, societies, and organizations that are working for the Hungarians. We are talking about religious, economic, political, and cultural organizations without exception.",
                "The years of all these Hungarian institutions are also numbered. And, if in an American city which has a large Hungarian population, a Hungarian newspaper becomes extinct, the social life there will become flat and the institutions will waste away.",
                "Naturally we all know that our Hungarian institutions have also been very hard hit by the world economic crisis.....",
                "We have here, for instance, the sad fate of our wandering theatrical troupes. How many churches do we have at present in America without a pastor? Or the reverse, how many pastors and teachers are performing their duties without salary? How many cultural societies have ceased to exist in the past year? How many members of sick benefit societies let their policies lapse? For all this we can blame unemployment or the diminished incomes.",
                "Therefore, at the present time the Hungarian institutions cannot be taxed with any extra burdens.",

And, when we have waded out of this economic chaos, a way must be found for a better mutual understanding....which will save the life of the printed Hungarian word and the future of our institutions in America.....",

Not the Hungarian-American churches and societies, because they were only institutions which used the Hungarian flag, but the Hungarian-American newspapers were the frontier fortresses of Magyar-America. The church, be it Hungarian, Slavic, Russian, or American, is primarily a sectarian institution and only secondarily of national character. If anyone says that any church in America is Hungarian, he is either laboring under a delusion or knowingly stating an untruth. His Excellency the Bishop (usually of Irish descent) says sternly. \"The church is mine. The school is mine. The cemetery is mine. And if you Hungarians don't do as I want you to, if you are not satisfied with the Hungarian-speaking priest I gave you, I will send you an American priest, who will discipline you. You can thank me for the goodness of my heart that I tolerate the Magyar language in my church.\"",

Our large fraternal organizations are hesitating to consolidate with one another to form one big insurance company.

With this step, which is on our threshold, the Hungarian character of our Hungarian societies will end.",

The much-maligned, disdained Hungarian press is the only exclusively Hungarian institution in America which has always defended the Magyar language, Magyar virtues, customs, and traditions. It could not very well do otherwise and maintain its own existence.....",

Martin Himler, who has kept up his chain of Hungarian newspapers through great personal sacrifice, has warned us that the complete destruction of the Hungarian-American press is fast approaching.....He says, \"Beware, because the flood that will engulf all of us is on the way, and it will be good night for the Hungarian-Americans.\"",

We have sacrificed our mentality, spiritual strength, money, and business honor in trying to keep up the Hungarian press. We have reached the end of our rope, and now it is up to the Hungarian-Americans to save their frontier fortresses\".....",

The Amerikai Magyar Nepszaja (American Hungarian Peoples Voice), also a daily with nation-wide circulation, had been having financial difficulties recently. After trying all means of saving the paper, nothing remained but to sell it to M. F. Wegrzynek, owner of Novi Swiat, a Polish daily. For fifty thousand dollars the Amerikai Magyar Nepszaja has come under the unrestricted control of a Pole, Mr. Wegrzynek.",

Strength overcomes weakness. \"The fittest will survive,\" says Darwin, the scientist. Foreign newspapers have been condemned to a slow death and stagnation since the World War and since the restriction of immigration. The owners of the Szabadsag and the Novi Swiat are fighting extinction by fusion. By cutting down publishing expenses, the business will be put on a firmer foundation. This fusion will probably save the Amerikai Magyar Nepszaja, too, from extinction.....",

Its editorials were full of praise for the policies of the Hungarian government. It was disgraceful to do such a thing in this liberal, democratic country.....",

It is not necessary in a case like this for a government to buy a newspaper; it is only necessary to give the paper financial aid until that government's aims are realized.....",

                "In the Hungarian Daily News we find that the Swedish consul in Chicago, who is the representative of Hungarian interests here, has had published an announcement in which he asks for the address of a certain Hungarian family which is supposed to be living in Chicago or in its vicinity. The article requests this family either to send to the consul their address or to present themselves at his office. We need not add that articles of this nature originate, generally, in our native land, where some member of a family is seeking lost relatives.",
                "It is completely in order that the article should have appeared in the Hungarian Daily News, for this paper is read by Hungarians in Chicago and its suburbs. Why it did not also appear in the Nepszava and the Elore, Hungarian papers which are likewise read by Hungarians in Chicago and its suburbs, is something that we can not worry about. Let them worry about it.",
                "But as to why this article or advertisement did not appear in the Magyar Tribune of Chicago, which is in fact the only Hungarian paper in this city published weekly--we certainly have some opinions to express regarding this discourtesy!",
                "There are two points that we wish to make clear before we express ourselves on this matter. The first is that in this discussion we make no personal reference to any one. We do not know the Swedish consul, nor do we know the person in charge of Hungarian interests. We have no ill feeling against them personally. It is only that their actions toward us were scandalous. The second point to be made clear is that though we live in a material world, in this case the amount of the price of the advertisement is absolutely of no interest to us. We do not know whether they paid for this advertisement or not. If they did pay for it, we know that the sum does not amount to such a figure as to be worth mentioning in an article of this size. For the cost of writing this article is much higher than the cost of those small advertisements which consuls are accustomed to have printed.",
                "Our article is not written for business reasons but from the standpoint of fundamental principles. From the standpoint of fundamental principles, in Chicago and its suburbs, the Magyar Tribune cannot and must not be overlooked or ignored.",
                "Those who wish to serve the interests of the Hungarians in Chicago and its suburbs must take advantage of our paper and not ignore its large circulation. Do not think for a moment that we are conceited, or have dominating instincts or wish to be dramatic in this pronouncement. We are the sincere guardians of Hungarian interests, the reporters of opinion, the mouthpiece of our native land, and the news agency of the Hungarians in Chicago and its suburbs. For six years we have served without relaxing our efforts and with patient loyalty.",
                "There were times when others made efforts with pen and paper to maintain a newspaper, and while we went through fire and withstood many trials and tribulations, they simply gave up and went out of business. Now we are alone, and our existence can be stopped only by dirty politics. Those who believe that they can ignore the Magyar Tribune in Chicago and suburbs by playing dirty politics are gravely mistaken.",
                "If the consul, because of dirty politics, does not notice us, then he not only is playing poor politics but is also guilty of sin. This sin caused the writing of this discussion. The sin is committed against those poor people in our native land who are patiently awaiting signs of life from these relatives of theirs who live in Chicago and its suburbs and desire to initiate closer relationships. The sin is also against those that live here and wish to communicate with those who are looking for them.",
                "Now then, without any question, our paper, the Magyar Tribune, is the most highly developed Hungarian paper existing in the Chicago area and the paper most widely circulated and most widely read, among the Hungarians. This we write not as an advertisement but simply as a matter of fact. Consider, if you please, the three Hungarian papers issued daily, the Szabadsag, the Nepszava, and the Elore. The total subscriptions of these three papers for Chicago and its suburbs, we are certain, is doubled by our list of subscribers. This fact gives us the right to feel proud, and we do not say this to soothe our wounded pride but to prove how ill the interests of Hungarians are represented by the Swedish consul.",
                "He who contemplates doing business with Budapest or with Szeged must consider which city has the larger population; he must not play politics. Szeged may be wealthier, healthier, more virtuous, more Hungarian than Budapest, but Budapest is the capital of the country and has the largest population of Hungarian cities. This is a fact, and here all discrimination stops, and all arguments end. This is how we stand compared with the Hungarian Daily News. We agree that the Hungarian Daily News is an older paper, is much wealthier, is issued oftener, is well known, and has a better income; but--in Chicago and its suburbs--the Magyar Tribune is the largest and most influential paper. Those who wish to send a message to all the Hungarians in Chicago and suburbs in the surest way can do it through our paper. This is the fact and the truth. Here end all arguments and all partiality. This is an axiom.",
                "If the consul is looking for Hungarians in Chicago and its suburbs, then it is, without the remotest doubt, his duty to seek them through our columns. He can seek them elsewhere, also; we have no quarrel with that; but he must take advantage of our columns without fail. First of all, he owes it, to those who entrusted to him the job of finding their lost relatives to do this. Secondly, he owes it to those whom he seeks to give them this great advantage, for those people most certainly are readers of the Magyar Tribune. Thirdly, perhaps he owes it to us, who are loyally serving the interests of the Hungarians better than any consul or other official is representing them.",
                "This would be the smartest procedure from the business standpoint and would be playing smart politics. Or do we still stand where we stood at the beginning, on the assumption, that, smart actions are not to be expected by Hungarians of their consulate?"

We are not writing this threateningly, but in a manly way, just as a man seeking employment speaks up and demands a hearing even if deaf ears are turned to him.

Kovach--who is known by the Hungarians of all America as Radio Kovach and is the director of the Hungarian radio hour at Gary--and Leslie Szegedy, a noted Hungarian publicist, who in his time was the editor of the Nemzet in Budapest, a weekly containing articles from the pens of none but Hungary's best writers. Not only does Radio present articles which are connected with the radio, but one can find in it other articles of all kinds, some with educational value and others entertaining. It has no political tendencies whatever; it does not allow in its pages any kind of personal controversy to appear; so it gives every sign of becoming in the near future the most widely read weekly newspaper in the Hungarian language, with the biggest circulation, since its content interests not only the Hungarians in Chicago but also the Hungarians all over America, even far away from Chicago. The subscription price is one dollar per year."

                "One of the outstanding Hungarian newspapers, the Szabadsag (Liberty), has been publishing the history of the Hungarian people in American in installments. The readers of this newspaper are usually interested only in the news items, and they barely glance through the section which contains this important and interesting history.",
                "People do not realize what a serious undertaking it was for the Szabadsag and for Geza Kende, who was entrusted with compiling this history. It has always been found important to make notations of important functions of societies and other Hungarian organizations, but up to the present time no one has had the time, or perhaps the serious thought, to start writing the history of the Hungarian-Americans.",
                "It is indeed a noble and great deed of the Szabadsag and its editor, Dr. Cserna, who, with Geza Kende, gathered this material and arranged it for publication.",
                "We, as editors of newspapers, realize perhaps better than anyone else how important an undertaking this was. We know how important it will be in years to come, when someone wants to know what the Hungarian people did to help build such great American cities as Chicago, New York, Cleveland, Toledo, etc.",
                "The history that appeared in the Szabadsag is now being printed in book form. The first book deals with the period from 1583, when the first Hungarian set foot on American soil, to the time of the Civil War. One of the most important parts of the book contains the history of Louis Kossuth and his travels in America.",
                "We think it rather important that the Hungarian people of America and their children get acquainted with this history which deals with the things our forefathers did for this country and the hardships they had to overcome. We know that the younger generation will feel mighty proud of themselves when they find out what an important part was played by the Hungarians in the Civil War.",
                "Geza Kende is a newspaper writer and a very good one at that. In his first book he wrote elegantly and truthfully about the pioneer work done by our forefathers in preparing the present America for us.",
                "The second volume will be a more difficult piece of history to write because it will deal with a more active and trying situation than did the first volume. This second volume deals mostly with Hungarian-American history during the past twenty-five years.",
                "We recommend that all our readers buy these books so that they may become acquainted with the role of the Hungarian in the development of the United States.",
                "We will write in a more detailed manner about the second volume in a later issue."

He is the first Hungarian priest, who gave a real meaning to the proverb: \"If the mountain does not come to Mohammed, Mohammed goes to the mountain,\" when he began to spread the Holy Gospel through the radio. There are many of those, who for one reason or other can not attend the church service, however much he or she may feel the need of it. To satisfy this need, Rev. Stephen E. Balogh made a truly record breaking step, when he created the so-called \"Invisible Church\" service with the use of the radio. He highly recognized the tremendous advantage derived from the fact that he can reach through the radio to everyone, from the richest palaces to the poorest shacks, who are thirsting after the words of the Gospel, and to announce the greatness of Our Lord.",

Even a Loop theater could not have produced a better program than the one we saw Sunday at the Hungarian Home. In the careful arrangement of the program one could notice the experienced hand of Irma Ferenczy [Mrs. Komarik], and though the rooms of the Hungarian Home were quite well crowded, yet the beautiful program should have merited an even larger audience, if for no other reason than because the direction intended to cover from the proceeds of this ball the expenses of the Hungarian Radio Hour broadcast from the Fair grounds.",
                "The program opened with a speech by Ivan Komarik, which was followed by the music of the Stratinsky Brothers of West Pullman in which orchestra Martin Stratinsky played the accordion, Jimmy Stratinsky the piano, and George Stevens the violin. The music met with great success by its strange composition. The graceful Soltesz Sisters from Indiana Harbor made a hit with their dances and music selections. There is seldom found so much talent in a single family: the beautiful piano selection by Margit was accompanied by Irma at the saxophone and Pauline at the violin, while Wilhelmine performed her fiery gypsy dance.",
                "Bertha Koczan, an East Chicago piano teacher, played the more serious selections, rendering some classics and some Hungarian pieces with great virtuosity. Also successful was the Youth Choir of the Hungarian Reformed Churches in the Burnside district and the West Side, which sang masterfully some very beautiful Hungarian folk-songs. This choir, thanks to the untiring efforts of Reverend Eugene Boros, is now one of the best choirs of America, and we hear that it will be increased to about five hundred singers, with the addition of new members from other Hungarian Reformed Churches, for its participation in the World's Fair.",
                "John Petri, former ballet maestro of the Chicago Civic Opera, provided a never-to-be-forgotten entertainment, in which his dancing pupils excelled, both in groups and singly. The ballet was composed of Mary Karpa, Irene Mezei, Rose Szabo, Dorothy Dreisen, Betty Murtz, and Mary Kitry. Little Irene Mezey was much applauded for her acrobatic dances. Her teacher, Maestro John Petri, predicts a brilliant future for her. The music for the dances of the Petri, group was played on the piano by Miss Mary Warner.",
                "The violin solo by George Szabo, Jr., of East-Chicago, who played Brahms' \"Hungarian Dance,\" encourages us to hope a successful and bright future for him. He was accompanied on the piano by Bertha Koczan. The young violin virtuoso received great applause.",
                "Radio listeners who already had heard young George Szopusek over the radio, met him again on this program. He sang the popular song \"Old Gypsy,\" as well as two songs in English, and was rewarded with great applause. In the next Hungarian number, Irma Ferenczy-Komarik exhibited her brilliant talent. The dancing group of Maestro Petri assisted her in this excellently arranged play, which gave an opportunity to Maestro Petri to show himself in a marvelous Hungarian dance. For long minutes after the ending of this number thunderous applause could still be heard. The program was concluded by a little burlesque, \"Night Quarrel,\" in which Mrs. Magda Hubert and Joseph Kaszas played very cleverly, keeping the audience constantly in good humor with their excellent acting.",
                "The performance was followed with a dance, the music for which was furnished by the orchestra of Miska Pal. The public left the Hungarian Home well late into the night, enriched with the memory of an evening well spent."

Such shows have naturally disappointed the lovers of Hungarian films, and only now will the public have occasion to enjoy a first-class picture, where the conversations, from beginning to end, are spoken to our hearts in the sweet language of our dear old country, in a manner which the Americans call \"talkies\".",

The program has been praised by many American lovers of music.",

We hope there won't be any Hungarian home where our song and music will not be heard at least once a week.",

We think this is the least sacrifice the promoters are entitled to expect from the part of the public. The address is Hungarian Group Station WSBC, 1300 South Michigan Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois."

It will begin a new evening semester on February 7, for those who work or are otherwise occupied during the day. This excellent school instructs its students in the creative arts, letting them work at their crafts either by hand or by machine. Heretofore, the school in Dessau had been the only institute which taught designing, painting, architecture, etc. Last fall Professor Moholy-Nagy, who formerly was associated with the mother institute in Dessau, established this new institute in the former residence of Marshall Field, 1905 Prairie Avenue, which was placed at the disposal of the new school by the Art Society of Chicago."

Eugene Boros and forty-one under the guidance of Charles Kovacs. At West Pullman there are forty-four children under the guidance of Daniel Bodor. There will be a total of 200 children taking part in the school's closing celebration in Pilat's Grove.

This gigantic affair involves 270 children, who have spent many precious moments of leisure time studying the native tongue of Hungary."

After conception, the human being is formed by the environment in which it lives. For example, during the time between conception and entrance into the outer world, the child is formed according to the nourishment taken by its mother, the state of her health, the kind of work she is engaged in during pregnancy, etc. All this plays an important role in the development of the fetus before birth, just as in the life of the born child the environment, the school, the work, companions, food, health conditions, etc., are factors which influence the formation of the characteristics of the man.",

                "In the course of this lecture we learned of the factors that have played roles in the creation of the present industrial stagnation. Unfortunately, neither the Hoover Commission nor the technocrats has shown us a way out of this depression. Sunday, February 19, again at the Wage Earners Home, there will be another lecture on the means whereby we could get rid of unemployment. The title of the lecture will be \"Technocracy, or the I.W.W.\" Lecturer is Paul Pika. It is of the utmost importance that the Hungarians attend these lectures in great numbers, as it is quite often that questions are debated which are closely connected with our daily life."

Its conviction is that the workers can obtain for themselves economic favors and success only through ample preparedness in the field of science. That is the reason why the Hungarian Branch of the I.W.W. is sponsoring a series of lectures for its members and their guests. The Hungarian branch of the I.W.W. has arranged for the winter months several lectures at its own building, the Wage Earners Home, 2419 Lincoln Avenue. The lectures deal with social sciences, technical subjects, medicine, etc.",

Last Sunday the talented Hungarian physician Dr. Hugo R. Ronay gave a lecture entitled: \"The Struggle of Medicine against Sickness in the Past Twenty Years.\" Dr. Ronay spoke about recent important discoveries and achievements in the medical field, discoveries which enable us to protect our health, prolong the span of life, and cure sicknesses hitherto thought incurable. He further discussed the origin, care and cure of certain diseases, putting emphasis on the proverb \"It is easier to prevent than to cure.\" He explained the importance of selecting the proper nourishment and brought to our attention the results of biological researches, which now prescribe the exact quantity of proteins and vitamins needed for the development of the body.",

Had we not known that they were Hungarian women, we would have believed they were members of the American committee, so elegant and impressive was their appearance.",
                "After a rather lengthy discussion, it was decided that a committee of four present a bouquet of flowers to Countess Karolyi at the lecture she was to hold Saturday noon at the La Salle Hotel.",
                "Mrs. Frank Glancz president of the Ladies Society, Mrs. Henry Vogel, Mrs. Leo Laszlo, and Mrs. Klein arrived at the Hotel La Salle at one P. M., and presented Countess Karolyi with a bouquet, consisting of roses and chrysanthemums. The presentation was made in the presence of some of the leading citizens of Chicago.",
                "In making the presentation, Mrs. Glancz made a very impressive and heartfelt speech. Countess Karolyi thanked each one individually, expressing her appreciation and hope of being with these noble ladies in the near future.",
                "Mr. Ignac Izsak welcomed the Countess, and congratulated her upon the grand work done in the interest of the people of Hungary. These interesting speeches were heard at a luncheon which was sponsored by the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations. There were five hundred people present, among whom were some of the most prominent people of Chicago. There were approximately twenty-five of the more prominent Hungarians present also.",
                "Immediately after the luncheon, Mr. Victor Elting, one of Chicago's prominent citizens, and also chairman of the reception committee, in eloquent remarks, introduced Countess Karolyi.",
                "Countess Karolyi appeared on the stage dressed in black, and was a beautiful picture to behold. At first, she spoke the English language fluently, but later, while referring to notes, she spoke with a very pleasing Hungarian accent.",
                "She spoke for one hour, and the people listened very attentively, being interrupted only on occasions of applause. It was not only heard by those present, but also by the outside world by means of a national radio hookup.",
                "Countess Karolyi's speech had two principal parts: One was the explanation of the Hungarian aristocracy, the other part was devoted to the political situations in Hungary as it has been since the World War, and the part Mihaly Karolyi played in this political setup.",
                "We, who are acquainted with the Hungarian upper class, were surprised at the frankness and accuracy with which she dealt with the Hungarian barons, counts, and dukes, who are to blame for the unfortunate situation of Hungary. She painted a word picture of the most intimate life of these noble gentlemen, and with a few humorous sayings, she immediately connected her story with the political life of Hungary.",
                "She then spoke of the arrogant, bloated society which looks down on the common people with contempt, and represents the governing body of Hungary. With historical accuracy, she related the political history of Hungary from Kossuth to the present Horthy regime.",
                "The part played by Mihaly Karolyi in the last ten years was emphasized as she saw it when she was Countess Katinka Andrassy, and her viewpoint after she became the wife of Mihaly Karolyi.",
                "The political part of her speech was so correctly built up, and was given so accurately that the part of the audience who knew the political history of Hungary from close range, was completely surprised. She not only tried to be sincerely loyal, but she was also brave in presenting her facts.",
                "Without any fear, she pointed out the betrayals and sorrowful incidents which were caused by the League of Nations, America, and the Entente, in the unfair division of Hungary, and while this was being done, the Karolyi government's stronghold was being torn apart. They wanted to force Karolyi to agree to the crippling of Hungary. She discussed these facts so bravely that even those who are not her followers are fully satisfied that she does not represent the upper class, nor the Horthy government, but that she is here for the sole purpose of bettering the condition of the Hungarians and the entire Hungarian nation. It is for their interest and future that she is making these sacrifices. At this point, Countess Karolyi answered a few questions, and this notable lecture and luncheon came to an end.",
                "Countess Karolyi personally introduced herself to the Hungarian people who were present, and expressed her wish to come back to Chicago shortly to see the large number of working Hungarians who reside in Chicago.",
                "The Chicago Hungarians not only owe Countess Karolyi a vote of thanks and gratitude for delivering such an educational lecture to the prominent people of Chicago, but we must also thank the Chicago Council of Foreign Relations Committee for giving Countess Karolyi the opportunity to present her viewpoints, and relate the manner in which the people of Hungary have awakened. Now we can see our position and understand our own history and future development.",
                "Countess Karolyi held a lecture daily at different places, presenting her problem before distinguished personalities. She was honored at teas and banquets at many exclusive and prominent places. Her five day stay in Chicago was a real success in connection with her appearances and lectures, which prove the high esteem in which Countess Karolyi is held, and on the other hand, it was an honor to the people of Hungary to have their problems of democracy and the future of the Hungarian people presented by such an apostolic figure as the Countess, who preaches and lives for the interest of her people."

We are not supporting the committee with our contributions, but are insuring the completion of the monument. He who has respect for the name and ideals of Kossuth will not shrink from bringing a small sacrifice.....",

Neither the American nor the Hungarian reactionaries can stop our enthusiasm for the dethroner of the Habsburgs, the liberator of the peasants, the flag-bearer of freedom, of equality and brotherly love--the republican Louis Kossuth."

                "p.13.................It happened twenty years ago. A number of far-seeing and sound thinking women and men came together to lay the foundation for an institute intended to help the brother Hungarians when they need to be helped. So they founded the Chicago Rakoczi Sick & Benevolence Society. Alexander Racz, Michael Bedocs, Charles Csaszar, Alexander Szondy, Steve Subert, John Gulyas, George Pravda and others started the movement. They worked for the name, for the idea, and their work was crowned with success. When their Charter arrived on March 4, the new society could boast of seventy-nine members already. The first president of the new society was Steve Subert. Other officers were: Secretary, John Gulyas; treasurer, Michael Bedocs; recorder, Charles Csaszar; comptrollers, Joseph Kardosy and Wolf Vajka.",
                "The first few years of the existence of Rakoczi can not be called rosy, notwithstanding the fact, that the number of its members grew. Even in the first year there were deaths among the members; but in the second year some of them tried to exploit the society for their own benefit. This brought in its wake some disturbances in the inner life of the society. The leaders did not hesitate, however, to take steps for order, and the year of 1916 sees again a strong and growing Rakoczi Society.",
                "The Rakoczi Society has only eighteen deaths during its twenty years existence (there were no deaths between 1927 and 1932). As burial-contribution the society paid a total of $5,745.00, and as sick benefits it paid $20,922.00 during the twenty years. The society also donated several hundred dollars for other human Hungarian purposes.",
                "During its twenty years existence the members numbered close to five-hundred, of these, as mentioned above, eighteen died; many of them moved to other parts of the U.S.; some of them returned to Hungary; but even today, when we are celebrating our jubilee, we have about 150 paying members, including fifteen of the founders, and assets close to $11,000.",
                "The officers in our jubilee year are: President, John Wolf ; vice-president, Mrs. Francis Gulya; secretary, Paul Toth; treasurer, Joseph Tury; secretary to the treasurer, Francis Gulya; recorder, Steve Tinko; controller, Mathew Huber; inventory clerk, John Korbula, auditors, John Danko, Eugen Komuves, Anthony Lachman and George Kallay; flag-bearer, Joseph Papp.",
                "During its twenty years of existence the Rakoczi remained true to those traditions, which it started out to follow, and to those principles for which the famous Hungarian prince, Rakoczi, fought. God shall bless it so long, as it remains loyal to the faith uttered by the great Rakoczi, and so long it follows its traditions."

                "The Federation's Executive Committee notices with pleasure that association members all over the country have begun to join our campaign in ever increasing numbers. From Milwaukee, South Bend, Dayton, Aurora, Columbus, Cleveland, Detroit, Buffalo, Youngstown, Hammond, Canton, etc., come news of successful meetings and of more associations joining the movement. The Federation, after reading the many letters it has received, does not palter with the truth when it says that in spite of every effort by some interests to frustrate this movement, the Hungarian-Americans are willing to act to save their associations and to join our forces.",
                "But not so the leaders of the greater Hungarian institutions of the nation! To them the collapse of small associations means little. The retention of aged members and those in danger of being stricken off the list, is not an urgent task for them as yet. At least this is our impression, to judge by the fact that, although the Federation's Executive Committee, pursuant to a resolution adopted at the convention, wrote asking them to join the action, they have not replied as yet. The Federation's National board of directors sent two representatives to the meeting of the board of directors of the Verhovay Aid Association to ask the latter to indorse the program adopted at the convention. The Federation's Executive Committee insists that the bond and bank losses of our great associations should not be borne by such members as were dropped from their rolls, and that the money the members paid through years as dues should not fall to the benefit of the treasuries of the great national institutions.",
                "The Federation intends to help all members--the aged as well as those facing loss of membership, and at the same time aims to put our institutions on a healthier financial foundation, so that in the future the officers of the associations may not rejoice everytime an old member, whose death is in all probability near, drops out. When an old member drops out, the treasury of the association is not obligated to pay insurance when he dies, which would otherwise be paid out sometime to the heirs of the insured, should he still be an active member at the time of his death. So, the Federation, while still keeping open the places reserved for the representatives of the national institutions in its National Board of Directors, is now urging the branches of these institutions to join this movement, regardless of the attitude of their central offices, and advises the same kind of invitation the Cleveland and South Bend branches of the Verhovay Aid Association gave their leaders. The Federation's Executive Committee feels that the action to induce the associations to join should take the form of public meetings attended by all organizations concerned.",
                "We should visit every local branch and invite it to join the Federation. If it is true that some individuals and groups are working to disunite the Hungarians (and perhaps this is the way they earn their daily bread), then the association members, who feel to their sorrow the collapse of their associations and the loss of their membership rights through no fault of their own, will surely want to act to rescue their money, paid through many years as dues, and to secure their membership rights.",
                "Ample examples are the letters of three associations in Whittman, West Virginia in which they complain to the Federation that they were not invited to the convention by the Preparations Committee (the reason why they were not invited was that the Preparations Committee did not know their addresses). The Hooversville, Pennsylvania, Federation of Associations expressed its regret that, on account of lack of funds its associations were unable to be represented at the convention and asked that resolutions adopted at the convention be sent to them, as they pledged themselves to work for our mutual interests.",
                "These and other similar reports plainly demonstrate that our associations certainly want to retain their aged members, as well as those who face being stricken off the rolls, and that they want to reinstate those who already have been dropped, as well as rescue those associations which operate on a fraternal basis and which are now on the verge of collapse. They want governmental loans through the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to compensate for the losses suffered by the associations in their bonds and other assets. Finally, they demand social insurance against old age, physical inability to work, and unemployment. They will strive to achieve all these in spite of all hindrances and obstructions.",

The Magyar Home will remain the property of this branch if the loan is repaid.",

                "The troubles of the Verhovay Aid Society have always interested and vexed us. The moment we heard that the Verhovay had purchased large blocks of Westminster Bond Company securities, we knew that there would be trouble. But it was not only we who were worried--others who were familiar with the business methods and manipulations of this company were also suspicious. The Bristol Company, too, was not a reputable concern in our estimation. [Translator's note: The Bristol Company was the underwriter of the Westminster Company.] The fact that the securities had to be insured raised suspicion in the mind of the public. We suspected that this was a good business deal for someone, and that somewhere someone divided the agency commission. These suspicions, however, were instinctive or quiet tip-offs, so that we did not want to shoulder the responsibility by publishing that something about the bond purchase was odorous. We also knew that to prove the charges would involve time and money, and that we would have to contend with hard-boiled opponents.....And, as proved by further developments in the case, even after conclusive proof of mismanagement, the members, as well as the directors, only half-heartedly started to clean house. The guilty ones withdrew from their respective offices only after loud protestations. We silenced our consciences with an article or two, but the majority of the members paid no attention to even the strong accusations in other newspapers. The events were left to develop in their own way.",
                "Foxiness, secretiveness, lawyers' tactics--all were in vain. The delegates' eyes were opened. They saw that corruption was real. The discredited president, Andrew Fejes, Jr., after accepting two hundred and sixteen dollars for expenses, resigned himself to his ignominious dismissal.....Dr. Ferenc Marthy, secretary, and Istvan Gaspar, treasurer, were branded as unfaithful officers and dismissed. The directors who accepted money in this transaction were voted no confidence. Taking into consideration the charges, they were accorded very light punishment.",
                "We are sorry that Chicago played such a prominent and unfavorable role in this scandal. The ex-president used to make his residence here. The business deal was made here. The bankrupt companies are here. These three circumstances caused the series of violations resulting in the horrible losses to the Verhovay, due to the worthlessness of the securities and the expenses of a special convention to investigate matters.",
                "Every intelligent person knows that firms like the Westminster and Bristol companies are rare exceptions in Chicago.....",
                "Naturally, a reputable firm cannot pay four or five per cent sales commission.....This is the reason the bond purchasers of the Verhovay did not look for trustworthy Chicago Hungarian or American companies, but took the money of the widows and orphans where there was a likelihood of fat commissions.",
                "The total ignoring of Hungarian bankers, business men, and lawyers of Chicago in investing this money of the public, was sadly avenged. Let this be a lesson in future business transactions. We are firmly convinced that if the bond purchasers would have consulted any Chicago Hungarian lawyer, business man, or banker before investing hundreds of thousands of dollars with the Westminster or Bristol companies, this national scandal, this serious loss of money to the Verhovay members could have been avoided. Any one of these people would have given information as to where and how the money could have been invested safely.....",
                "One thing is certain, and that is that in the future it will be the duty of organized Hungarian newspapers to follow the activities of American-Hungarian societies with watchful eyes. They must ruthlessly expose any underhanded methods and save the wealth, earthly and spiritual, of the Hungarians. Furthermore, the Hungarian public should be freed of parasites, leeches, and degenerates. By these means only will the life and future of American-Hungarians, already contaminated, become healthy again. We express the hope that the Verhovay Aid Society will recover soon without a relapse from these losses. Let them be more circumspect and thrifty in the future. Let God lead them on the path of peace, honesty, and increased strength."

                "p.6.....Andrew Fejes, President of the Verhovay Aid Society, was suspended from office for his participation in the purchase of securities from the Westminister Bond and Mortgage Co. According to the judgment, Andrew Fejes transacted this business alone, and also gave an order for $50,000 worth of securities to the company; if the other officers wouldn't have consented to pay for it, they could have been compelled to do so by a court order.",
                "According to the by-laws of the association, suspended officers may appeal within thirty days, and Andrew Fejes did hand in his appeal. In the appeal he contradicts every statement of the prosecution and concludes that he is not morally responsible for the unlucky purchase of securities. He denies giving the firm an order in November,1925 on the contrary, he wired the society's legal counsel and later personally advised him against the deal. To prove that he had nothing to gain by this transaction, he points to the fact that the commission on this sale was paid to the Verhovay Aid.",
                "Against Fejes is the fact that he signed the order Jan. 1. He defends himself by stating that he didn't know that certain officers of the society were working against him underhandedly. He goes on to say that Emil Pressburg, owner of Westminister Co., only received the order Feb. l.and that it wouldn't become Final until positive proof was shown as to the soundness of the securities.",
                "Fejes instructed legal counsel to ascertain whether the underwriters, United Lloyd were financially responsible. Legal counsel, according to Fejes, said the he found everything in order and that he saw no reason for not buying.",
                "Fejes suspects an officer and one of the directors to have had a hand in stock purchases. They made commissions and didn't account to the society. He wants a special meeting to be called where it will be decided who are the real culprits.",
                "Fejes wants satisfaction from the Verhovay. If he doesn't get it he will sue for $200,000 - even though he loves the society he has helped build.",
                "The society will investigage and if Andrew Fejes proves to be innocent, he will undoubtedly receive satisfaction. It is up to the society to find out whether the charges made by Fejes against two leaders are true. It is for the good of the society to clear up this matter."

He has always been very careful in advising the Society to invest their capital, and yet he has fallen into a trap which involves the loss of considerable of the Society's funds. In time, it is possible that the investment will prove to be profitable, but at present it seems unlikely that the Society will ever get its money back. Andrew Fejes should have known that there are unsound securities as well as sound ones; he should have sought expert advice before investing the money.",

                "Let us take, for instance, the life of our societies. For fifty years the State of Illinois paid no attention to sick and death benefit societies. The law was so liberal that a sick benefit organization could be a social, dramatic, burial, sick benefit and life insurance society. The charter permitted anything.....",
                "Eventually, [however,] diverse influences resulted in the restriction of the freedom of activity of our organizations. The present law states clearly under what conditions a sick or death benefit society may function. These requirements are so rigid that the weak and tottering societies are either doomed to extinction or they must consolidate with stronger organizations.",
                "The moment we hear of these new restrictions that will limit the freedom of activity in our societies, the first effect is a feeling of resentment. There is a conflict in our minds between familiar ideas and new ones. Sick benefit societies up until now have had a life like that of the Csikos [herd boy] of the great Hungarian Puszta [plains], who obeyed only the laws of heaven. Last year a new law was enacted and when we consider that it is not its purpose to annoy us, we will come to the sane conclusion that its purpose is the protection of our orphans and widows.",
                "The Hungarian societies were always magnanimous to their members, although in many cases it was apparent that some members took advantage of this and drew sick benefits for long drawn-out illnesses. Due to lack of professional insight, these vacationing pseudo-patients easily hoodwinked the well-meaning, but ignorant, visiting members whose duty it was to make reports. If, unfortunately, a society had many such members, it would have been sufficient to drive it into bankruptcy. The new laws puts more responsibility on the shoulders of the officers and physicians, but for the honest officers and members this will mean no hardship.",
                "Until we understand the new law better, let us not take a hostile attitude toward it. Let us not think that it means the end of our societies. Let us discipline ourselves; and let us not only reorganize according to the new law, but let us also school ourselves in the spirit of this law.",
                "Professor Smith advises that these constant changes in the social order should not be greeted with animosity and antagonism by the minority, but with studied understanding and self-control which will make these changes more bearable. Our children understand the spirit of these changes and they do not harp on the good old times. They consider the present order of things natural and not--as we do--revolutionary and despotic.",
                "The path of the pioneer is full of thorns, because comfort-loving, slow thinking, shortsighted mankind frantically clings to the old order, regardless of the fact that the new one is better.",
                "In this present era everything is specialized. Since we find this true in trades and professions, why cannot our societies be specialized also? Whereas in the past a society had to take care of sick and death benefits, and at the same time was a social and dramatic club, now we can specialize. We can have social clubs, glee clubs and dramatic clubs.",
                "Members of these specialized clubs will be those who are kindred spirits, who think alike,who have the same hobbies. This will eliminate much of the antagonism and make for more successful co-operation. This is the secret of long-lived native American organizations."

Perhaps many people wonder why a Catholic society that even bears the name of Virgin Mary commands such great respect among people belonging to different religious creeds.",

This number was augmented by the formation of the young people's society, with its twenty-three members. Then, in 1917, the St. Imre Young People's Society merged with the Virgin Mary Society. From that time on the Society grew with leaps and bounds, until it became the most powerful and the largest society in Chicago. We also found out that in the past twenty years the total income of this society was $99,775.70, and that the expenditures were $81,994 leaving a balance of $17,781.70.",

Those elected to the committee were: Joseph Fekete, Julius Prekop, and Istvan Belustyak. The president is Andras Simko. Belustyak announced that, after examination of all the matters before the committee, everything was found to be in order.",

That one aim. which we all have, is to help our brother Hungarians in Chicago; in other words, we are to relieve them in case of death in their families. when we are aiding our brothers, they are better prepared to face their grief.",

If we look back on the 1920 records, we find that our membership has slightly increased, but to have a stronger foundation we must build up our membership. We know that many of the Hungarians in Chicago have sent their money to help their relatives in our homeland, and many others have returned to our homeland. Our task is not easy. We started the year of 1920 with 432 members, 42 members have dropped out, 6 members have died. We had 384 members left, who brought in 16 new members, making a total of 400 members. I am disheartened, for I have to announce that our fellow member, Jancs Majlath, has just passed away after a very long sickness. Let her soul rest in peace.

A vote was taken, and Mr. Kirner was elected, as were Mr. Fekete, Mr. Mihok, Mr. Kocsis, and Mr. Boszak. They were authorized to contract for one thousand inches of publicity.",

Those delegates whose societies were unwilling to pay a daily wage voluntarily resigned, so as not to burden the society. It was decided that because such payments had never before been made, and in order to insure success of the plan, the society must arrange a form of entertainment, including a dramatic performance and a dance. Every member is to purchase a fiftycent ticket. A committee was elected to take care of all arrangements for providing an income for the payments of daily wages to delegates. The members are: Mr. Mihok, president; Mr. Belustyak, vice-president; Mr. Boszak, notary; Mr. Kirner, secretary; Mr. Kondrath, treasurer; the trustees are Mr. Pachmeyer, Mr. Andrew Pasztor, Mr. Labas, and Mr. Mike Skiba.",

Fukovits for eleventh class, and Mr. Joseph Pirko for twelfth class. Mr. Mihok went into detailed explanations of the work to be done by this committee.",

The dance was held in the huge Schoenhofen Hall, which was filled at a very early hour. Peter Kardos' first-class orchestra played, and his music was so lively that in no time every one in the hall was dancing.",
                "To doubt that the dance was a success would be foolish. It is known that any entertainment arranged by the Rakoczi Society is always a success. Of course, the success of their attractions is due to the cordial reception they always get.",

Until then we will limit ourselves to informing our readers that the dance was a success."

                "Many newspaper articles of the past have been devoted to the discussion of the possibility that the American-Magyar population will form a united fraternal and benevolent institution set up in such a manner as to make provision for the payment of compensation to itssick members. So far, no definite substantial plan has been presented with enthusiasm to any group. This is because we are not interested in the future, and because individual societies have been awaiting for others to start the movement, believing that the society to lead it, will be in need of the additional protection afforded by a combined membership. To organize with this purpose is a necessity for all. The foundation for this movement was laid in 1919 at a conference. During this conference, many questions and ideas of great interest were discussed at great length.",
                "We have found that the little attention paid to the formation of one united mutual benevolent society is not due to the inability of the societies to pay claims. On the contrary, the fact is that every society, according to modern standards, is materially sound. Thus, it follows that, to strengthen such organization and make it safer in relation to the future, re-organization is very necessary. Let us assume a sincere attitude in the discussion of this matter, so that we may determine whether it will be of any benefit for the membership to effect a consolidation, or let things remain as they are. I favor re-organization; first, because when any of several scattered societies ceases to function, a large loss is suffered by its members. The following is an example: A member of many years standing in the Rakoczi society, after this society cracks up due to poor experience and withdraws from activity in the State of Illinois, joins the Petofi society, which advertises a $1,000 death benefit insurance. The member, after withdrawing his membership from the Rakoczi society, to which he paid premiums and dues for many years, loses all rank and benefits and becomes a member of the Petofi, the dues of which he keeps on paying for a period of years until he meets with a misfortune that causes his death.",
                "This person's family would be happy to receive the $1,000 death benefit from the society, but as this society has been declared insolvent, they receive no monetary or other benefit at all when it is most needed. If the Magyar organizations were united, the shifting about of members from one society to another would be avoided.",
                "The combined wealth of the American-Magyar's four largest societies is nearly one million dollars, with a combined membership of about fifty thousand Magyars. To set forth in detail the advantages that would accrue from a consolidation of these scattered organizations, would require a long explanation. I will, therefore, limit myself to touching on the material side of the situation.",
                "In the event of a re-organization, the membership should be grouped at a central point.",
                "Hence, it follows that those who paid dues or premiums should be grouped separately. This procedure would bring about the conservation of a large sum of money to face the problems of to-day in dealing with matters of this kind.",
                "It is a fact, proved by statistical figures, that the death-rate in a large group is proportionately smaller than in a small group. But, let us assume that the death-rate shows a proportionate increase at one intermediate point. In that case the obligations of the society could be met with money earned as interest and the prompt receipt of premium payments, which is not permissible under the present system.",
                "Some may ask why? In my opinion, our present day societies ply one another with too many quarrels, jealousies and revenges. This will continue until the young people will lose respect for all of them and the membership that is left will be unable to guarantee security for old age.",
                "In my opinion, the Magyar's plan of re-organization is very beneficial and, for this reason, the leaders of the societies, should not bicker so much. Instead they should consider the start of the proper movement, calling a meeting of all societies to discuss it. If the purpose at heart is to save the Magyar societies' future, this is the proper action."

Others say that the Hungarian-Americans have enough troubles now without shouldering new burdens. There is no end to the objections against a Hungarian Catholic orphanage. The usual answer is that there is no money and that work is scarce.",

It is strength of conviction that brings about and keeps alive great institutions and finds a way to finance them. There is an old American saying, \"Where there is a will, there is a way,\" that expresses what we mean.",
                "The realization of a Hungarian Catholic orphanage depends on whether there are enough Hungarians in America possessing the spirit of conviction required to inspire men to benevolence.",
                "It is true that there are enough orphanages in America where our orphans can be placed. However, why should we entrust the children of our late fellow Hungarians to the care of strangers? Why should we impoverish our race this way? Mutilated Hungary needs every one of her sons -- including the ones born or naturalized in other countries. As long as the Hungarian-American is brought up in a suitable Hungarian environment, he will become not only a useful American citizen but also a defender of the Hungarian cause -- a cause with which the world will sympathize some day. And who knows? Possibly one of these orphans has been selected by God to be a leader, a prophet who will be the champion of the Hungarian cause.....",
                "One of the most important aims of the proposed Hungarian Catholic orphanage would be to preserve every drop of Hungarian blood, which would otherwise be lost without leaving a trace. We believe that the true Hungarian spirit is not departed from the hearts and souls of the Hungarian-American Catholics, and that they understand the importance of this cause and will make sacrifices.",
                "Interest in the Hungarian Catholic Orphanage is growing every day. Those who observe the weekly reports of donations will notice more and more names of contributors each week. This is a sign of awakening. It is a regrettable fact that this awakening is not general.",
                "The fact is that the majority of the contributors are poor and have large families. Those who are familiar with American standards know that all Hungarian-Americans are not poor or have large families of eight or ten children. Large families, naturally, cannot afford to donate more than a dollar. In spite of this, the first contributions have come from poor families, proving that interest is not general, especially among those who have more of the worldly goods and from whom one would expect generosity.",

Therefore many people thought that this organization had ceased to exist. The organization is still in existence, and hasn't the least idea of disbanding.

They did not look for faults in their own plans but were continually finding fault with other people's ideas, and blaming them because their plans were not successful.",

                "Both of the above mentioned Societies are interested in the Hungarian Home idea. They have shown so much interest in it that the Hungarian Social and Sick Benefit Society, and the Chicago Hungarian Rakoczi Society voted to contribute two thousand dollars, and fifteen hundred dollars respectively.",

To rehabilitate this building it would cost a great sum of money, and the two societies mentioned above believe that the construction of a new building would be cheaper.",
                "The hardest problem seems to be to find a practical central location where this building should be built. The older Hungarians of Chicago know what great changes have taken place in Chicago in the last twenty-five years.",
                "Certain districts which were residential twenty years ago, have become rooming house, manufacturing, and warehouse districts. The Hungarian districts also have changed. For instance, twenty years ago along Grand Avenue,the Hungarian language was very common, and practically all business along the street was conducted by Hungarian people, while today there are very few in this district.",
                "Today, North Avenue seems to be where the majority of the Hungarians are. Therefore, we do not have anything definite so as to guarantee the fact that these Hungarians will stay here for the next five or ten years. With the center of Hungarian population changing, it is hard to pick a central location for the Hungarian Home. We must also consider the transportation problem. This Home must be so located that there is some form of transporation to it from all parts of the city. A home such as this will serve to develop Societies, both of cultural and social activities, making it of utmost importance in the life of our people that the Hungarian Home be built.",

                "The Independent Hungarian Society has announced that they would donate three hundred dollars, but we haven't heard from any of the others as yet. We do not think it quite right for the delegates representing the different societies to voice their opinions referring to the construction of the Hungarian Home, because many of these societies either are not in favor of the idea, or they are not in a position financially, to contribute toward the fund for the construction of the Home.",
                "The governing committee of the Hungarian Home project should consist of those people who represent societies which are financially interested in the future of the Hungarian Home. This is dictated by a democratic and business principle.",

This matter should be decided by the votes of the members of all the organizations who decide to participate in this movement. There has been news spread among the Hungarians, that the committee representing the Hungarian Societies Central Committee wishes to drop this important matter, and give it up as a worthless idea.",

We have also received many letters with comments urging us to present their ideas to our readers. We also received many letters praising the article which appeared last week.",

These people understand the laws, and they would be in a position to accurately state how much it would cost to reconstruct a building so that it could be used by the different Hungarian organizations. Then the committee can decide whether they can afford to buy and reconstruct such a building.",

                "We are not experts in building and construction principles, but some other people called our attention to the fact that this building would have to be completely reconstructed internally, and we feel that these facts should be presented to the Hungarians of Chicago.",
                "We hope that this Hungarian Home idea which is actually taking form among Chicago Hungarians will end without misunderstanding.",
                "We should forget the things that happened in the past, and we do not want anyone to commit such wrongs. We do not want the committee to present the Hungarian Home as a reality until they are sure of themselves, because if they do, it will only create a feeling of distrust and may become a laughing stock.",

Let the fight be handled by Davis, Coolidge, and LaFollette. Let us stay as a respectable audience and applaud when the time comes.",
                "\"The Ku Klux Klan is openly against the colored, the foreigner, the Jew, and the catholics. Let us look at the census of 1920 and see what this organization is going to fight: In the United States there are 20 million catholics, 11 million colored, 14 million foreigners, and approximately 4 million Jews. This total represents the number of people the Klan is attempting to fight.",
                "\"Aren't we right? Let's laugh in the faces of the Ku Klux Klan!\"",
                "What the Szabadsag recommends is the easiest and simplest end to this matter. But this problem cannot be solved this way. To give advice such as this in regard to a situation involving an American problem is not only out of the question but it is a sin. Therefore, we want to take this opportunity to say to our friend newspaper that this newspaper's viewpoint of this situation, both politically and actively, is different.",
                "We will state why.",
                "There are two reasons why we think the Szabadsag's standpoint is wrong.",
                "One of the reasons is that we think the Ku Klux Klan is a serious and destructive political power in the United States. It is true that neither Cleveland nor Chicago are very strongly organized; but in Texas, Indiana, Maine, Oklahoma and throughout the entire Southern States its organization is strong.",
                "There are certain towns and cities, both in Illinois and in Ohio, where the Klan is powerful. In these towns and cities the minority is ruled by terror. This terror is not brought on the minority because they are waging a battle against the Klan, but because the aims of the Klan are to take away those privileges upon which the principles of the government of the United States was founded. They are terrorized by the fact that the principles of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness will be taken away from them. The terror of the Klan does not stop with scares and threats, but they have been known to inflict bodily injury.",
                "The Ku Klux Klan can't be subdued by laughing at them, nor by ignoring their activities, and we must not leave the others alone to fight the Klan. The Klan is a secret political organization. This organization was formed secretly and the only way to defeat such an organization is to bring the battle out into the open.",
                "We must bring the sunlight into this darkened pit. The brightness of the sunlight and publicity will eventually break this secretly built castle.",
                "There are spoiling buds that develop only in the darkened dampness of a cellar. When these buds are brought out into the fresh air and sunshine they fade and die. This is the way we will be with the Klan. Since the New York World began writing articles which are unfavorable towards the Klan, and the press throughout the entire nation has been giving them unfavorable publicity, the power of the Klan has diminished, and all self-respecting, native born Protestant persons have kept away from this undesirable secret organization.",
                "The aims and purposes of the Klan are such that if brought out in the light they will not bear up under pressure; therefore, it is our duty to work against the Klan, so that it will fade and die like a musty flower.",
                "What publicity can't do, the strongest form of defense-organization, will gain its purpose.",
                "Yes! we must organize against them just as they have organized against us. Only we will not organize secretly, but openly, like they did in Texas. Their strength here will be broken just as it was in Texas.",
                "Let us look back eight or ten years. What did the Anti-Saloon League's activities look like at that time? In Chicago and in Cleveland we laughed at these fanatic modifiers and reformers. The editorial staff of the Szabadsag would have bet any amount of money that there would be absolute prohibition in Chicago, Cleveland, and New York.",
                "Prohibition was thought of as a big joke ten years ago. On theatre stages the Anti-Saloon League was made fun of, and every once in a while the newspapers would write humorous articles about this childish movement.",
                "Prohibition was regarded the same way that the Szabadsag regards the Klan movement. People thought that they could drive these prohibitionists out by laughter and ignorance. Organization was not thought of, because it looked as though it was unnecessary, in fact they were afraid because they thought the Anti-Saloon League would gain more power.",
                "In the meantime, the Anti-Saloon League entangled the nation in a net, with the exception of the larger cities, and leaned on congress, and waited for the psychological moment, the World War, when they made prohibition possible as a war measure, which later made absolute prohibition possible.",
                "After prohibition became a law it was useless for the alcoholic beverage dealers to organize for action; it was too late, the damage had been done.",
                "Prohibition was born and it stayed while others laughed; they were organizing.",
                "In organization, there is strength and success.",
                "This is not only a good by-word, but it is the golden truth. It is a tried and proven fact.",
                "The other reason why we don't agree with the standpoint of the Szabadsag is that they write directly against organizational work, and especially against the Hungarians organizing.",
                "We have emphatically stated how important it is to organize against the Klan as an American movement, but now we would like to say a few words with reference to pure Hungarian organizational work. We realize that it is a rather neglected subject, but this seems to be the ideal time for it.",
                "The Szabadsag, as one of the most powerful Hungarian organs in the United States, must grasp this opportunity to awaken the Hungarians from this sinful lethargy, of which it has been suffering during the past few years.",
                "Please believe us that this is being written for the benefit of the larger Hungarian newspapers, calling to their attention the fact that the Hungarians of this country are without any kind of a national or political organization.",
                "Water can not wash this sin from us. Although we have come to the decision that due to the sorrowful political situation in Europe, the larger papers, for diplomatic reasons, cannot be engaged in organizational work. But we do think it would be a rather wise move to start an American-Hungarian national organization. Because the large newspapers can bring this about if they have the will to do it.",
                "It is up to the Szabadsag to start this movement and to make such an organization a reality; not only because it is a Hungarian newspaper, but because of its traditions during the past thirty years and the ashes of Tihamer Kohanyi dictate this fact.",
                "Tihamer Kohanyi had many faults, but we must admit that he was active in Hungarian organizational work, even if some of his ideas were not accepted by the more prominent leaders. He was always willing to donate space in his paper and work by his staff for the betterment of Hungarian movements and organizational work.",
                "During Kohanyi's time the Szabadsag did not have such a good financial status as it does today. Many Hungarians seem to think that because the financial situation of the Szabadsag is so good today that it is neglecting the interest of the Hungarians, but we do not believe this. We believe that the men running the Szabadsag are unselfish, self-sacrificing, and willing workers.",
                "Such men as Cserna and Fonyo, without mentioning the others connected with the Szabadsag are not afraid of organizational work among the Hungarians, and they have no reason to be.",
                "Taking everything into consideration, we recommend that the fight against the Klan be stopped. Publicity and organization are the best weapons to fight it with, and we must take these in our hands.",
                "Without paying any attention to party affiliations, we must stand with those who openly take their places against the Klan.",
                "As far as we are concerned this is a very important matter, and until Coolidge renders a decision on this matter, as Davis and LaFollette have, we will have to stay away from Coolidge.",
                "We must do the same thing with all other candidates for office; we must force each and every candidate to show his colors. Those who are with us we will help to the best of our ability, and those who do not express their attitude towards this question, are against us; therefore, we will not show any mercy towards them in the field of politics when election day comes.",
                "The statistics as stated in the Szabadsag are also wrong. They talk about 20 million catholics, 4 million Jews, 11 million colored people, and 14 million foreign born people. In the first place we must not consider that there are 110 million people in the United States. Among the 14 million foreign born there are a few million catholics, some Jews, and even a few colored people. Among the 20 million Catholics there are those who are foreign and those who are colored.",
                "Most of the colored people live in the South, where their political power means nothing.",
                "In other words, if the plan of the Ku Klux Klan works out so that all the white Protestants, who are native born, join their organization they will control the nation's most important public offices, and their power would not be centered in individual states, they would get so strong that their power would mean a deciding factor in Congress.",
                "Therefore, we advise you not to laugh at this matter, but to organize in order that the Klan may be defeated."

When analyzing these problems, even political adversaries are expected to be objective....therefore, we too will endeavor to be objective in giving our views. In our opinion, Hoover's administration either is spineless or is deliberately serving that class which does not consider the time ripe for drastic measures in solving the economic problem....It--the Hoover administration--has chosen the easiest, but the most humiliating method: it wishes to aid the unemployed through charity....",
                "We remember that Hoover,while serving as the American Food Commissioner during the World War, was successful in organizing relief and alleviating the suffering of the Belgians. Equipped with this experience, he is preparing for the coming winter and for the very critical presidential election..",
                "We must concern ourselves with charitable movements, because winter is approaching rapidly, and from the intensive national and governmental relief activities we can conclude that there will be no recovery from the business and industrial slump and that this winter will find millions of people out of work. Therefore, the millions of unfortunates must be taken care of..",
                "This will be the third hard winter since the fall of 1929, when the crash started this world economic depression. It is natural that all classes and strata of society should feel that we are living in hard times. Those who expect miracles are doomed to disappointment, because miracles will neither solve the economic crisis nor alleviate the hardships of a bitter winter. We, too, will do well, if in the given circumstances we make suitable preparations for the fast-approaching winter.",
                "The city of Chicago has already begun a campaign for contributions to provide the unfortunates with clothing, food, and fuel. All the organized charitable institutions of Chicago will cooperate with one another this winter, and charity in Chicago will be systematized....The city charitable institutions conduct their activities on a scientific and practical basis. Their personnel have years of experience and are all especially trained in social science.",
                "We note the foregoing primarily to reassure our readers and secondly to provide them with an example. It is a well-known fact that the Chicago Hungarians, too, are hard hit by the depression. We know that during the past two winters many of our wealthier countrymen, as well as our societies, were called upon to contribute to the aid of our Hungarian brothers. By the beginning of this month we had already been notified of five Hungarian charitable movements.",
                "The willing spirit and motivating power behind these Hungarian \"help your fellowmen\" movements are touching and praiseworthy. However, even these Hungarian charitable movements must be conducted systematically this year. We have only words of praise for those wealthy individuals who conduct their own charity work and give of their worldly goods to others who are less fortunate, but for those, who wish to practice charity through organized channels we have a few words of advice.",
                "The Hungarian unemployed of Chicago will have as much right to apply for public aid as any other Chicago resident. Probably many of them will turn to the city agencies, because undoubtedly many Hungarians are facing this winter without employment. We know, too, that our wealthier countrymen and those who are steadily employed contribute as freely to public charities as any other Chicagoans. On the other hand, we also know that the nine-million-dollar city fund, which will be distributed to the needy this winter, will leave many homes cold, many children unclothed, many sick unattended and without medicine, and that some of our countrymen who have seen better days will probably not have enough to eat.",
                "It is only natural, therefore, that individual national groups are endeavoring to do charitable work among themselves to aid their countrymen in facing the relentless rigors of winter. The same humane motives also characterize the charitable movements in Hungarian circles.",
                "It is expected that these Hungarian charitable movements will supplement city aid, that in fact we will call upon city charity only when it becomes imperative to supplement our own charities. This will depend, however, upon the amount of money the Hungarians can accumulate for this purpose. One thing certain is that it is to the interest of our unemployed and needy that the Hungarian churches and societies organize their charitable activities and centralize them to induce co-operation with the city fund.....",
                "In this widespread unemployment situation many of our modest countrymen are seeking public aid for the first time. They must not be made to suffer because of the professional beggar.",
                "The methodical, unbiased, fair practice of charity is a requisite of organized action. Those who dispense charity impulsively in these lean troubled months do good with one hand and with the other withhold aid to worthy, needy families; in other words, they are unjust.",
                "It will be easier for us, as Hungarians, to investigate a Hungarian applicant for charity than for the city authorities to do so, and we can thus be of assistance to the authorities and to the applicant as well....",
                "The first step is to organize the charitably inclined Hungarian churches and societies. We owe this much to those of whom we expect contributions. It would not be fair to solicit contributions from one individual repeatedly, while others are not even approached once. Just as an applicant may receive aid from all sources if there is no system in the dispensation of charity, a stingy, well-to-do countryman may evade making a contribution if there is no record of the contributors.",
                "We repeat that we are not concerned with the individual actions of our wealthy countrymen, but we do advise those churches and societies to which needy Hungarians would turn not to shun publicity, thereby making things more difficult for the applicant and for those who would contribute money and time.",
                "The Magyar Tribune, as always, offers its help in these charitable activities. However, if anyone attempts to exploit this movement for his own selfish motives, this newspaper will expose such acts relentlessly."

                "In Walla Walla, Washington, eight workers have been imprisoned since the end of the World War, a period of eleven years. For more than a decade they have been suffering innocently, condemned to forty years in prison, because they dared to defend their union headquarters against the brutal assault of the American Legionnaires. The result of this clash was that two people died and a number were injured on both sides. The workers, who were attacked by an overwhelming number of Legionnaires, tried to defend themselves, but lost the battle; many of them were taken prisoners. One of the prisoners, a veteran by the name Wesley Everest, was tied to an automobile by the Legionnaires; his body was torn to bits. Most naturally, true to American customs, the union workers were arrested, terribly beaten, and arraigned in court. The jury, war-hysterical, and the judge, hating the workers, found the prisoners guilty; they were sentenced to serve forty years.",
                "In the fall of 1928, the ten living members of the jury sent a petition to the governor requesting that the eight union workers be set free. They stated that their verdict at the time was influenced by war hysteria. The judge who conducted the trial also sent an appeal to the governor in behalf of these prisoners, as did the captain of that division of the American Legion, who had led the attack against the workers. The governor, however, has refused to hear these pleas, because it is more important to him to please the wealthy lumber mill owners for whom he provides cheap convict labor, than to please the respectable voting citizens.",

                "A repetition of the foregoing incident has taken place in Gastonia, North Carolina, where the textile workers have been on a strike against the textile barons, by whom not only mature workers, but also growing children of twelve and fourteen, are compelled to work long hours for starvation wages. The unscrupulous textile barons forcefully ejected the strikers from the company houses and made it necessary for them to pitch tents in the open. Gastonia's brutal police attacked the strikers while the latter were sleeping in their tents, and mercilessly beat men, women, and children alike. The braver strikers resisted the brutal police, who took fright and fired on the workers. When the smoke of the guns had cleared away, the cries of mothers and children were disturbed by the moaning of the wounded and dying. The captain commanding the firing was accidentally shot by his own men, but the authorities held the strikers responsible for his death....Thirteen men and three women are being held on a charge of murder, and their trial will begin at the end of this month.",
                "The Protective League, established in Chicago at the time of the great mine-workers' strike, considers it its duty to hurry to the aid of the Centralia and Gastonia workers. It takes this opportunity to urge the members of all Hungarian organizations in Chicago and vicinity to be at the Wicker Park Hall on Sept. 1, where a mass meeting will be held, which will serve as a protest against the trampling of the human rights of the workers of Centralia and Gastonia.....Chicago's Hungarians have always worked hand in hand with the Protective League heretofore; therefore, it is to be hoped that, in this time of need, they will, as true Hungarians, co-operate again.....The proceeds of the gathering will be used to assist the unfortunates."

This musical comedy was presented by that well-known Chicago Hungarian cultural society, The Chicago-Hungarian Independent Song Society. This musical comedy was presented for the benefit of the starving children in Hungary. The name of the play was \"The Hero from Brezovacz.\" It is one of the most modern Hungarian musical comedies.",
                "The sad feature of the affair was that the children of Hungary will not receive as much as a crust of bread from the benefits of this performance, not because the organization which sponsored this affair did not want to give the profits to these children, but because there were no profits. The Chicago-Hungarians turned their backs to this charitable affair.",
                "It is a shame that the Hungarians do not take more interest in ideas of modern times. The Chicago-Hungarian Independent Song Society is primarily organized, not as a profit-seeking organization, but as a cultural and educational organization."

As this activity grew older, certain conditions developed which made it very difficult to get donations for this noble cause.",
                "It was found that the Hungarians were too weak financially to make sufficent donations to meet the requirements of the fund necessary to take care of these starving children of Hungary. Other donations from people who might well affort it, were small, due to the fact that there were other nationalities conducting similar campaigns. This particular situation was not only faced by the Hungarians, but all the other nationalities as well.",
                "A suggestion, made by the American Society of Friends, was very eagerly accepted by the different national groups.",
                "We find it necessary to explain to our readers who the American Society of Friends are. In America, there is a religious sect which is one of the oldest religious groups in this country, and are known as Quakers. They do not believe in War, and will not become involved in any enterprise where human life is at stake. This being one of their methods of teaching the faith of Christ. It is a well known fact that the United States exempted the Quakers from enlisting as soldiers. In order to show their patriotism, and true religions beliefs, they formed the \"American Society of Friends\" at the outbreak of the War. Work was begun immediately when circumstances permitted. France was the first country where they started their noble work. Out of the ruined towns in this country, they re-constructed fifteen towns. They plowed vast fields, and planted various grain in order that they would produce life-giving materials. After the War, they immediately moved into the countries that were more centrally located. Germany, Austria, Russia, and even Hungary, enjoyed some of the blessed work of this good-hearted organization. What they did in Hungary can be readily seen. When railroad transportation was practically at a stand still, and hospitals were in dire need of supplies, this organization used its own trucks to transport supplies, and in many cases, used their own supplies to aid these hospitals.",
                "This organization has submitted the following suggestion to the different foreign relief groups: To incorporate all the various foreign relief groups into one organization. Through this incorporation, the group would only have to solicit contributions only once from the American public, thereby they would receive larger contributions from individuals. The American press would cooperate in this movement, and it would supply publicity for this unified organization.",
                "This proposition was taken up at a luncheon here in Chicago. Representatives from Germany, Hungary, Austria, Russia, Czecho-Slovakia, and Jugo-Slovakia, were present. The representative Hungarians who were present at this meeting were: Joseph Byfield. Dr. Stephen Barath, Mrs. Reiss, and Leo H. Laszlo. These representative Hungarians were very well satisfied with this proposition. Mr. Joseph Byfield was selected as the chairman of all Hungarian committies that will take part in this work.",
                "This luncheon also served as a medium through which the different nationaliites could bring about a more friendly feeling and a better understanding towards each other.",
                "This newspaper will supply accurate information in regard to this work and its progress. We feel sure our readers are deeply interested in this new development."

In the first place this affair strictly concerns all Hungarians. Those starving children in Hungary are Hungarians. To whom can these unfortunate children turn, or whom can they ask, if not the Hungarians-Americans who are able to help lighten the burden of suffering in our homeland?",

Today, there are 180 kitchens in Hungary advertising the activities of the Relief Committee.

He has just returned from Europe and fully understands the serious conditions that exist in Hungary. He will not only answer inquiries concerning these charitable activities, but will give advice in the matter of conducting them, so that to this end, the greatest good may be done and thus bring honor to the Hungarians.",

The committee has gone one step further. It is now supplying food and plans to supply clothing soon. In a few weeks we will hear the good news that the good American Samaritan has clothed 10,000 Hungarian children. To date, contributions have reached the $300,000 mark. Of this amount, the Hoover Committee has turned over $259,000 to Budapest authorities, and at the present time they have $29,500 on hand.",

They would never accept help from a stranger. Today, when we have to save the future generation, we are letting strangers take care of this very important matter. Perhaps our Hungarian pride is dying.",

As in the previous years, so also this report shows that the foreign born populace committed relatively fewer crimes, than the native white citizens.",

These records were compared with the other datas and fingerprints, which are kept at the central bureau, after which they are classified and divided into statistical groups. These again were tabulated, to find out, in what proportion the different groups participated in crime. Taking 100,000 residents as a base, the crime list shows the following proportions in committing crime: burglary: foreign born (percentuel) 3.6, native whites 16; larceny: foreign born 1.5, native whites 3.8; fraud: foreign born 3.6, native whites 7.6; sexual crimes: foreign born 2.6, native whites 2.9; against the narcotic laws: foreign born 4, native whites 1.6; disturbance of peace: foreign born 4.6, native whites 8.1; vagrancy: foreign born 6.3, native whites 17.4; but on the other hand against the laws of beverages the foreign born sinned 4.7, the native whites only 3.7.",

Assault and battery 10.1 of the foreign born, while the native whites had 8.5. All in all,the proportion is this (taking always 100,000 as base): the rate of the foreign born is 99.3, while that of the native born is more than twice that, that is 211.9",

                "Recently a professor of the University of Minnesota made a study of criminality in the United States and at the same time made a comparison between the native Americans and the immigrants. Up to the present time the general belief was that the percentage of criminals among immigrants is much greater than among the natives. The basis for this belief was upset, because during the course of research it was found that the immigrants do not play a leading part in criminal activities.",
                "Three methods are used to determine the ratio of criminals. According to Judge Kavanagh of Chicago, \"Aside from the Negro criminals, two-thirds of all crimes are committed by immigrants or their direct descendants.\" This statement is essentially correct, but the relative proportion is exaggerated. It would be more precise to say that fifty-five per cent is the ratio of which thirty per cent are immigrants and twenty-five per cent immigrants' children.....",
                "The second method figures the ratio by the number of convictions and imprisonments. Apparently four hundred eighty-nine out of one hundred thousand immigrants go to jails or to reformatories annually, while at the same time only two hundred thirty-nine natives are convicted.....This estimate does not take into consideration that the immigrant criminal group differs from the native in sex, age, and composition. This is important because the majority of offenders are young adults and there are many of this element among the immigrants living in cities.",
                "The third method is the correct one. It compares and differentiates between white natives and immigrants according to age, sex, and geographical division. According to this method, the foreigners are not on top of the criminal wave.",

It is unfortunate that our lack of space makes it impossible to publish his letter in full, for every line of it deserves attention. We will summarize what he says:",

The hall, which accommodated twenty-five hundred persons, was filled to its utmost capacity, despite the fact that the seats were numbered and cost a dollar and seventy-five cents per person. The performance, which was supposed to begin at 8 P.M., began promptly at that time. The twenty-eight musicians, all simple workmen, played the overture with remarkable harmony. Fejfar observed that the stage was so large that it could have easily accommodated the whole audience of some of the Hungarian amateur performances. He spoke highly of the sixty or seventy actors who gave skilled performances, and he commented favorably on the audience which sat in silence during the whole performance.",
                "Fejfar describes his emotions as follows:",
                "\"And I was stung by jealousy, to realize that the nation which did so much wrong to the Hungarians is capable of such accomplishments, and that compared to them, we, who are regarded as a brave and daring nation, seem to be so insignificant in this regard.",
                "\"We are given to sitting with a glass of good wine, beating our chests, and telling the world what good Hungarians we are, but when it comes to accomplishing something in the interest of our race, our nation, or our language, to preserve our standards, we drink one more glass of the good wine, and go towards our goal--to nothing.",
                "\"But not so the Czechs. The Czechs do not [give up so easily]; they do not say-- like many Hungarians--that in ten or fifteen years there will be no Czech association, Czech language, Czech newspaper, but what they do say is that even if there were to be no more immigrants there would be Czechs here, even after one hundred years.",
                "\"The Czechs do not reply, when asked to cultivate their native language, 'Why, our youth does not like that!' as our Hungarians are apt to answer; they want to keep up their national individuality, and what they want, they are going to get.",
                "\"When a Hungarian association arranges some amateur show, it has to be planned on a small scale; little money can be spent on preparation. It seldom happens, however, that the arrangements committee does not incur a deficit. On the other hand, a Czech workingmens' association does not hesitate to launch a five-thousand-dollar proposition. The Poles, the Italians, and the Czechs have their own movies, homes, churches, and various places of amusement, and almost every Sunday they stage amateur shows. They know that in this way they may prolong the life of their group. They can hear their national songs on their own radio hours; and announcers who speak the respective languages perfectly enable each group to retain its native language and perfect its style.",
                "\"And what do we do? We do have a couple of struggling weekly Hungarian radio hours, and some altruistic Hungarians are trying to maintain the showing of Hungarian movies, but to our sorrow, they have to bolt. When members of Hungarian associations try to arrange an amateur show, the others ridicule the idea and destroy it before it materializes. Even if they do succeed, the audiences are always very small; in some cases the performers have had to play to almost empty houses, and in almost every case there is no profit, and soon the amateurs lose interest. They fear a repetition of the fiasco.",

This, in no way, conflicts with American life and demands. American ideals do not demand that we become so narrow-minded as to ignore everything but that which is American. On the contrary, America urges us to become familiar with the best that other nations can offer. America is sufficiently fair-minded to realize that the main roots of its civilization are buried in the soil of the old world, and that its culture is principally a combination of European tradition and American environment.",
                "\"Very good\", say our readers, \"I am willing to study the Hungarian language, history, and culture, but what practical value will I derive from this study other than that of becoming a more cultured person?\"",
                "This question is taken under consideration by a French scholar and pedagogue, Abbe Ernest Dimnet, who, after touring America, recorded some of his observations in his book, \"The Art of Thinking.\" The book is excellent and should be read by all young American-Hungarians. It is written in English.",
                "In a chapter entitled \"Obstacles of Thought,\" the writer delves into the so-called \"parasitic\" thoughts, and then goes on to \"How mental parasites are produced\" by criticizing the methods used in educating children in American schools.",

But in America, he says the study of foreign languages is hindered by one great \"parasite:\" \"The mass wants easy methods, and so the methods are easy. It wants immediate results, and practicability is considered first. Easy methods seem to be a dogma with Americans,\" As a result, Dimnet's book, \"French Grammar Made Clear,\" has been misquoted many times because French grammar cannot be made easy. Nor can Latin grammar. Both ought to be made clear and interesting.",
                "As we can readily see, this applies just as well to Hungarian grammar and composition as to any other language. In the study of the Hungarian language, the very best psychology is to persuade the pupil that hundreds of people less intelligent than he have conquered those dry beginnings by mere perseverance.",
                "We bring this to the attention of our readers. Let them not fall into the error of regarding the study of the Hungarian language from the purely utilitarian viewpoint, but let them bear in mind the words of Abbe Dimnet that \"Utilitarianism in education is as disastrous to culture as the easy methods are to scholarship.\""

                "We should not delude ourselves in the belief that the management of our Hungarian associations will be successfully continued in the hands of our Hungarian second generation. For the last several years we have been stressing the necessity of attracting our young Hungarians to our associations, but if we attain as much success in the future as we have attained until now, our efforts will be in vain.",
                "It is useless to cry over the mistake we made several years ago, when we failed to turn our eyes to the youth, when we not only did not take them into our associations but even excluded them from our midst. All this crying now will not help us any.",
                "There is only one remedy for this, and it is that we should get busy on the work of attracting the youth to our associations. This work was begun some years ago, but we have to do this task with more willingness, diligence, and understanding.",
                "Those who have attentively followed the work of our associations will find that the latter, especially in the case of large institutions, are still headed by the same old Hungarians who were there twenty or thirty years ago. Sometimes there is a change here and there, but generally we can see nobody but old Hungarians as heads of our institutions.",
                "This certainly is not a healthy condition. Who will lead these Hungarian associations after these old Hungarians are dead? Who will take care of Hungarian interests, the worth of which by now we estimate at millions of dollars? Who will continue to stand for the good reputation, the good name, and the institutions of the Hungarians who were torn from Hungary and who are now Americans? These are questions to which the answers must be given quickly, as it might be too late in a decade, and it certainly will be too late in two decades.",
                "What we failed to do in the past, we have to do now and do it quickly. We must attract the youth to our midst and hand over to it the work and responsibility now in the hands of our old Hungarians.",
                "Besides our own aloofness, another reason why our young generation stands so apart from us is that the Hungarian associations are not organized like the American ones. Though our associations satisfy our expectations and our conceptions, they do not comply with the ideas of the American-born younger generation. We cannot deny the fact that, even ten years ago, our associations were so primitive that they could not stand the competition of American institutions. The young Hungarians knew this, and therefore it is not to be wondered that they did not attach themselves to our associations but rather preferred the greater American institutions instead.",
                "But now the situation is not the same. The Hungarian associations are more up to date. Our youth can now find in the Hungarian associations everything the American institutions are offering. What is more, even the greatest insurance companies do not offer more than our greater associations are offering. This fact we now have to bring to the attention of our younger Hungarians, as they themselves do not care much about that. It is in the interest of the older Hungarians that the youth know about this, that it join us, that it take over our work. Naturally, we too have to relax on our old customs and conceptions, or otherwise we would block all intercourse with the youth. We old ones will never be entirely assimilated but our young generation is, since it goes here to school and is reared in the spirit of this country. They will have an easier task in managing our associations in the American way than we older ones had.",
                "Now is the time to think this over, because now we have the chance to make a choice, since the elections of officers in different associations is close at hand. We have not only to organize the youth into our institutions but to put them to work in our organizations as well, even against their will, against their hesitancy.",
                "We can see that in many places Hungarian administrators from sixty to seventy years old are taking care of the interests of much more younger members. Many of these old men do this work out of good will or just because they are used to it--many, again, for the simple reason that if they step aside there will be nobody who would do the work.",
                "That is by no means in order. However much the old Hungarian may love his association, and however much good will is prompting him to serve it, he must realize that he cannot do his work as efficiently as a younger man. With this in mind, he should step aside and make room for the younger people. And where the old are working because there are no young ones to do the work, in this case the young ones should be ashamed of themselves, as it is not fair that old men should work for the benefit of the younger ones.",
                "Further, the young Hungarians should be told that these Hungarian associations, which they have slighted, are for their benefit, as the money which these associations pay when the old men die will not be buried with them but will be handed to their heirs. And if the youth is only too willing to accept help from the Hungarian associations, it is only reasonable to expect from it to do something in return for them.",
                "From whatever point of view we look at this question, and in whatever form we express ourselves,the time is ripe to make room for the younger generation in the management of our associations, as this is in the interest of both the old and the young.",
                "With the month of December, the elections of officials started among our associations. The destiny of an association depends on its officials. If the officials are good, the business of the association is good, which rule we have experienced for the past decades. Diligent, conscientious officials, unshaken in their Hungarian feelings, always bring prosperity and new blood into an association. Where the officials are of this type, the association lives and the members work and conquer all dangers, even in such times as those of last year.",
                "Our associations were in good hands this year. Experienced conscientious, efficient officials were managing them. We came through the year without any mishap or shock, and now the time is to think on the future. We cannot afford to elect officials in a hasty and superficial way. We have to consider many things this time, as the years become more and more difficult for the associations.",
                "We consider it our duty to remind the members of the associations that, as with almost all of our institutions, the foundation for success lies on the idea of our Hungarian brotherhood. It is this fraternal link that holds together our institutions even today. If we disassociate this brotherhood from any of our institutions, whichever it may be, the latter collapses. When electing new officials, first of all we have to judge whether they are fit to keep the association together, and whether they are able to keep it Hungarian, for, no matter how prosperous the association may be, if its Hungarian foundation collapses, the need for its existence ceases.",
                "By this time we know each other quite well. We also know those in whose care we trust the fate of our associations. Therefore, let us elect for officials only those who are men enough to do this work fittingly.",
                "There is something else to which we have to call the attention of the members of our associations: it is not enough to elect good officials unless the members support them, for no official, however fit, can attain any success all by himself. Even the greatest military genius would lose a battle if the soldiers don't do their duty.",
                "It is a malady of long standing in the lives of our associations that some members of the minorities, when their candidates are defeated, not only refuse to support the elected ones but do everything in their power to hinder them in their duties, so that the official be unable to accomplish his work successfully. Unfortunately these dissatisfied members fail to realize that by hindering the work of their officials they are working against their own interests, for, if the association does not prosper, their own interests suffer. In the first place we have to get rid of this cancer in the life of our associations, and to restore to them the unselfish brotherly love which is the foundation of all our institutions. Once that is done, the officials will be able to fulfill their obligations and succeed in developing the associations to the joy and full satisfaction of the members."

I maintained that it is of even greater importance now than in 1910 because of the changed boundary lines of European countries, and I am pleased that I have this day received a communication informing me that my contention was approved and that the next census will again provide that information.",

The boat arrived late in the evening, and the Countess was held aboard with the other passengers. There were other reasons besides the late arrival of the steamer which kept the Countess aboard. S. Stanwood Menken, president of the National Security League, has started deportation activities against Countess Karolyi, whom they have named \"Red Katherine.\" Their grounds for deportation is a claim that she is a Bolshevik, and she will be a detriment to the principles of American government. Menken filed a complaint with H. Curran, Immigration Officer, stating that her presence was no more desirable than the presence of Emma Goldman, and her followers, who had recently been deported, therefore, her entrance to the United States must be stopped.",
                "The immigration authorities allowed Countess Karolyi to enter the United States on Monday morning. The Menken activities were not stopped. Before the Countess arrived, Menken had asked the members of the reception committee if they knew their names were on the list by their own consent. Mrs. James W. Gerard, the wife of a prominent international figure, and a sister of the wife of Count Szigray, immediately telegraphed an answer to Menken's question, informing him that the committee had asked her two weeks previously to be one of the reception committee, and she told this committee that she wanted to withdraw when she found out who Countess Karolyi was. The same procedure was forwarded to Mrs. Elon Huntinton Hooker, and the committee received the same answer made by Mrs. Gerard.",
                "According to Dr. Stephen P. Duggan, president of the Institution of International Education, it was Hooker who questioned whether Countess Karolyi was a desirable visitor or not, and at first he said that his wife withdrew from the committee, and later denied that his wife was ever a member of this reception committee.",
                "We must also mention the fact that through the efforts of Robert J. Caldwell, a member of the reception committee, the State Department had the New York City police department detail a special police escort for Countess Karolyi, after it was learned that she had received several threatening letters. We can expect many demonstrations from those who sent these threatening letters, and the Countess will be under guard during her entire stay in the United States.",
                "In the New York Times the following question was asked Countess Karolyi, by Menken: \"Is it true that you are a communist, and that you are known as 'Katherine the Red' in Europe?\"",
                "Laughing, the Countess replied: \"My husband and I are Social Democrats, and this does not mean that we are Communists.\"",
                "This work of deportation, all the work of Horthy and Menken, is done to prove Countess Karolyi's Communistic activities through articles which were written in a book by Cecil Tormay. This book was written for the sole purpose of glorifying the domination of the white terror, and is filled with falsehoods about communistic activities, and its aims are to prove the ties between Lenin, Bela Kun, and Countess Karolyi.",

                "Countess Karolyi will come to Chicago, without a doubt, and we good Hungarians who have read this article must realize what an important mission brings her to this country, and what obstacles she has had to overcome. We hope that we will soon find out how the Chicago Hungarians will celebrate her visit to Chicago.",
                "The New York World, one of the most powerful publications in the United States, wrote a very interesting editorial with reference to the obstacles put before Countess Karolyi by Horthy, Menken, and others. This editorial appears in this newspaper verbatim, with our own compliments. The idea of this article is to show the Chicago Hungarians the great interest that is being shown by the American people with reference to the policies and conditions existing in Hungary at the present time.",
                "In order that the American people be considered friends of Hungarian policies,the form of government in Hungary should be changed from the present reign of Horthyism and terrorism. This change must take place from one end of Hungary to the other. We hope that the Chicago Hungarians realize the fact that the American people are interested in our affairs in Hungary, and will cooperate to make Countess Karolyi's trip one that will make Hungary a truly democratic government.",

Regardless of its other features, this plan is easily feasible. We are positive in our surmise that it would greatly help to gain the acknowledgement and understanding of the rightful demand for a revision if Hungary would pay its debt to America as soon as possible. If this proclamation of ours is favorably received by the ranks of the Hungarians of America, the celebrating Hungarians ask the Federation of Churches and Associations of Chicago's South Side to get in touch with the leaders of the nationwide great four Hungarian associations, requesting them to be the collectors and responsible leaders of this great common cause of the Hungarians, and to form a national committee for this purpose.",

Mr. Iroczky, treasurer of the Federation, announced the withdrawal of his membership from the Verbovay 164. He could not induce the committee to turn over to him $142 deficit.",
                "We do not know all those who wilfully disrupted the Federation, but we know that the death blow was dealt by the group which was planning to have a Hungarian Field Day at Soldiers' Field. The cost $3000, rental for a day of the Field, was utterly impossible, and those societies, made up of the more sane and sober thinking members, withdrew their membership.",
                "We have just been informed that there are only three societies which are still members of the Federation. One of these is the Sport Club, only recently formed, and is originator of the Hungarian Field Day idea."

This applies not only to nature, but also to the social and economic institutions. The moment anything living ceases to move forward, it stagnates and begins degenerating and finally dies.",
                "We see, that social systems, that do not progress become static and perish almost over night. Institutions, in which the driving forces of development, and the will to live have ceased, inevitably fail.",
                "It is scarcely a year and a half, since a new idea appeared in the ranks of the Chicago Hungarians, or rather within some of the Hungarian associations; the idea of a federation of the Hungarian associations. The associations felt keenly that in order to achieve something in the interest of the Hungarians, to make themselves known, they must get together, co-operate. This Federation did live through its infancy, but now it has a duty to develop itself, to grow into an institution which can serve the interests of the Hungarians of Chicago. It is necessary that all those associations, which did not join, should do so now, and that the basic-idea, on which this Federation was created, and which is now insufficient, should be further developed. If we want to serve the Hungarians and their different associations, we have to participate in the conduct of their affairs. We should consider not only their material and social well-being, but also the development of their body and mind. If we look at the activities of the various nationalities, do we see anything Hungarian on the arena of public life? Do the Hungarians have anybody in a leading position who could serve as a mouthpiece of the Hungarian interests? Why is it, that every nation has some sons in the general public political field except the Hungarians? Because all the other nationalities support their co-nationals. The Federation does not need to participate in politics, but is should use every means, grab every possible opportunity, to serve Hungarian interests.",
                "Propaganda comes second in importance. We have to use the press and the radio. We should advertize the good qualities of the Hungarians, thus strenghtening the brotherly love and understanding. We have to uphold the pride of our national origin. We can be and we are good Americans, but we do not have to forget our national origin. For the guarding of this pride of our national origin among the young, the best procedure would be the formation of Hungarian Sport Clubs. We should promote and support the Hungarian Sports. Why could we not have a proper gymnasium , swimming pool and open field for the Hungarian youth of Chicago?",
                "Why should it not be possible for the Federation to maintain, during the depression, and employment office, where both the employers and the jobless could come with full confidence and which would be entirely free for both? There are often cases, when the associations or some of their members need legal counsels. There should be a Legal Department of the Federation, with a Lawyer at its head, to which those in need could turn for legal aid.",
                "We could continue mentioning all kinds of social and economic institutions needed for our Hungarian brethren, but we should also remember the needs of their body. We should organize a department of health and hospitalization in order to assist our members in case of sickness. We should aid in lengthening the lives of our members by providing them with periodical medical examinations. Briefly, we have to develop the Federation to an independent organization, the members of which would have all kinds of benefits.",
                "Certainly, to attain this goal the Federation needs money, but this money is easily obtainable even in these days of depression. The main thing is reciprocal confidence, co-operation and the will to do it. There is no need for lengthy discussions and debates, only deeds count. And if we do as told above, we should enjoy a success, which will advantageously reflect not only on the members alone, but will be to the glory of all the Chicago Hungarians, and then: God has given Wine, Wheat and Peace!"

                "p.28..........Some days ago there came into my hands the picture of Joseph Zsedi, which was given me by him when he visited Chicago, on September 21, 1902. As associate director of the National Alliance of Hungary, he brought with him a Hungarian flag, intended as a gift to the Hungarians of America and which he carried with him to the unveiling of the Kossuth-Monument in Cleveland. If my memory does not deceive me after these thirty years, there was a deed with this flag, by virtue of which the guardianship over that flag would be entrusted for only one year to each of the Hungarian societies. Last summer we found the flag in Detroit. The Committee for the Hungarian Day of the Century of Progress Exhibition did everything in their power, to secure the flag for that occasion, but failed. When the one-year term of guardianship expires, for the Hungarian society in Detroit, which society became the guardian? Who are these men who decide the question? So far I know the Federation of Hungarian Societies of Greater Chicago demands the distinction of becoming the guardian for the next year of this, from Hungarian viewpoint, historical flag, so it should be kept in Chicago for the next year."

                "Four years ago a few members of this organization thought that it was about time the Hungarians of the South Side should build themselves a Home, and the idea was put before the officers and members of this Society. The idea was thought worthwhile, so other Hungarian organizations were consulted in regard to this question. Many meetings were held, but very little was accomplished.",
                "The Virgin Mary Society wanted to build, but they were afraid that some other Hungarian organization also was considering this project. It seemed as though no other Hungarian organization was even thinking of putting up a building of this kind, so the Virgin Mary Society at their March meeting appointed a committee of twelve to draw up plans and make the necessary arrangements to get started on the building.",
                "This committee worked hard and faithfully, and they submitted a completely detailed plan for the construction of the Home.",
                "These plans were accepted, and it was decided at this meeting to float $90,000 worth of bonds through a reliable bank, and the Society would pay six and one-half per cent [interest] on these bonds.",
                "This projected \"Hungarian Home\" is a new idea in the lives of the Hungarians of America. This is the first time that a Society has gone into a project which will act as an influence for more Hungarian activity. Now the Chicago Hungarians will have a place they can call their own and they can feel mighty proud of themselves.",
                "We do not want to look at this project as one that belongs to the Virgin Mary Society alone; we want to look at it as one that is for the interest of all Hungarians of Chicago.",
                "We think that every Hungarian person who is financially able to buy these bonds should buy some, because he will be helping a very worthy idea, and the dream that most Hungarians of Chicago have had, will come true.",
                "The editorial staff of this newspaper wishes to congratulate the brave leaders and members of the Virgin Mary Society, and the Society can rest assured that this newspaper will co-operate in every way to see that this Home is built, because we of this newspaper know more than anyone else what it will mean to the Chicago Hungarians, and especially to those living on the South Side."

He was a great statesman, a great general, loved his country, and was a real hero who always fought for his country. He astounded the world by leading his small army to victory in their fight for liberty. He freed his country from British oppression and thereby started the United States on the road to a glorious future. The population of three million has grown to today's 130 million. Without Washington's victorious fight for freedom, the people of this country would probably never have attained the present standard of cultural and economic progress.",

What George Washington did in his time to save his people from disaster is being done today by our great President, Franklin D. Roosevelt.

Follow me, your leader, I will lead you to victory.\" \"The power of kings lie in the happiness of the people \"said King Charles II\"not the Turk, but dispute among ourselves, was our downfall at the battle of Mohacs.\" According to our records, \"Our country is split three ways, An Austrian is on our throne, Turks overrun our plains; only in Transylvania is there Magyar spirit, but there too the Austrians and Turks are working. Beware that the Austrian assistance doesn't become a boomerang.\"",
                "The selfishness of Charles III, Maria Therese's insincerity, the tyrannical rule of Joseph II, have not killed our love of country,\" said Berzsenyi.",
                "\"The United States of America has gained recognition, France has won liberty, everywhere around us the sun is shining on the nations, shall the Magyars be the only ones to remain in bondage? \"asks Stephen Szechenyi! \"Rise, ye Magyars,\" says Petofi (greatest poet) on Mar. 15, 1848. The chronicler goes on to say: \"The youths, whose leader was Petofi, freed the Press, outlined in fourteen points the demands of the Magyars and had them accepted by parliament. The new laws went into effect April 11. Victory was ours without bloodshed. But as night follows day, the Austrians resented Hungary's freedom, and hired the Croations, Slavs, Serbs and Roumanians to war on the Magyars in the hopes that fear will drive them for protection to the Austrians. Kossuth, the real father of our country, said, \"We would rather die than give up our independence.\" Our army of volunteers was victorious over all when the cornered Austrians received reinforcments from Russia. This put an end to the uprising Most of our leaders were killed in action, others were captured and executed. Kossuth escaped to England and later went to the United States.\" The Austrians later made a pact with Hungary and the two countries were on more or less friendly terms from 1867 until 1914 when the world war broke out. We were automatically swept into this war and lost everything. We are free now, but beggars, because two thirds of Hungary's territory, more than half of the population fell under foreign rule. We are completely desolated.",
                "The last act is over, the curtain goes down, and the history of our country up to today is ended. We, who saw in our imagination, the great heroes of the past, on't despair. Our country is not dead. We hope that we have learned a lesson and that our country will again be powerful some day.",
                "We who have two countries, have responsibilites too. Even though we are far from the land of our birth, we shouldn't forget her and we should try to help in every way. It is a beautiful gesture to die for one's country, but still more beautiful to live for it."

The convention will not deal with political problems, in the discussion of which the unity of the Hungarian-Americans always splits.

The time is ripe for unified action and those who for any reason--the Red menace or any other equally unfounded phantasmagoria--attack the Chicago convention or try to frustrate its work, are only demonstrating their willingness to sacrifice the interests of the associations and that of all the members for their own selfish purposes.",

                "A long cherished dream of Catholic Hungarians living on the northside is near its realization. Hungarian Catholics of the northside are twice those living in Burnside, yet they cannot boast of even a satisfactory church life, on account of the fact, that they are scattered all over the northside. The reason for this is, that they did not have a centrally located church for themselves, which could be reached easily from any part of the city. The now existing church, is a small chapel, hidden away, which never could shelter all the Catholics of the northside, whose number must be several thousands, if for some reason they would wish to come together all at the same time. The believers, scattered all over the city found church going far too tiresome and time wasting, so joined some other, not Hungarian speaking congregations. This was, from a Hungarian viewpoint, a great loss, as the younger generation, either,was not given a religious training at all, or if given, the foreign priests were not teaching them anything at all, which would have some Hungarian connection, and so these young Catholics became strangers to the Hungarians.",
                "Now the Catholics of the northside intend to buy a new, a bigger, and nicer church, which should be situated, so that it could be easily reached from all parts of the northside.",
                "The Hungarians will gladly greet the action of their Catholic brethren of the northside, which can have only praise-worthy consequences in its wake from the Hungarian viewpoint in general. In this movement one can recognize the cherished hope, that the Hungarians will come closer to each other through this planned purchase of the new church; their children will remain good Hungarians, and as such, become good citizens of our adopted country, the United States.",
                "Now, that the northside Catholic Church has such a well-known, splendidly educated, and capable parson as Doctor Jacques Wildinger, there is need only for a new, satisfactory church building, where the new generation of Hungarians could be regained for the Hungarians. In this aim, to maintain our racial existence in the future, all the praise is due those, who as Hungarians, and also as Catholics, are doing all they can, to achieve this long cherished task. In this endeavor all the other Catholic Hungarians, without exception, are going to help. From the church purchase meeting, we can report the following:",
                "The first steps toward the buying of the church were taken on the second day of Christmas, at the general meeting of the Saint Emery Church. The presiding parson told the well attended meeting all the reasons, that necessitates the purchase of a new church building. The present little church makes absolutely impossible, the development of the parish, by its situation, size, and its past, and does not serve at all the needs of Hungarian culture. It is almost impossible to keep a church up very long in a leased building. Almost everybody and the Hungarians especially desire to live in a home, which they own. The time has come, when it is necessary, that the Hungarian Catholics of the northside should acquire a church of their own.",
                "Then he made it clear, what benefit would be derived by the purchase of a church building, and specially that one, which was looked over. At the end of his speech he asked the meeting to form men's and ladies' committees and to begin collections for that purpose.",
                "A general enthusiasm and applause broke loose after Doctor Jacob Wildinger finished his speech, and those present were thronging around the donationlists, eager to sign their donations.",
                "The first to sign was the Altar Society which donated its whole assets, and signed $500 for the purpose, by which act, it gave a very good example for the future offerings. The parson expressed his sincere thanks for the offering by the society and the splendid example given by them.",
                "Then the different committees were chosen. The men's committee compose, Joseph Rakos, Alexander Steiner, Paul Timko, John Balazs, Joseph Minarovics, John Svinyiczky, John Bonifert, John Leonard, Emery Rady, Vince Klenner, Frank Balogh, William Fejfar, Louis Hirth, Alexander Rakos, Steve Minarovics, as members.",
                "The members of the Ladies' Committee are: Mrs. Minarovics, Klenner, Sipos, Steiner, Ivan, Koza, Svinyiczky, Leonard, Olcsanyi, Laky, Szabo, Nemeth, Kardosy, Rakos, Miszty, Bonifert, Pummer, Wagenhals, Bazso, Kish, Kovacs, Fury and Wiesinger.",
                "The committees will be organized after the mass on January 2nd, and begin functioning.",
                "In the meanwhile, the signing of the list of donations is merrily going on, with the following record: Each of the following offered One Hundred Dollars: Joseph Minarovics, Steve Leonard, John Svinyiczky, Emery Rady, Mr. and Mrs. Sipos, Frank Kish. Fifty Dollars each was offered by: Alexander Steiner, Joseph Rakos, Alexander Rakos, Paul Timko, Joseph Kish, Steve Minarovics.",
                "Twenty Five Dollars each: Louise Miszty, Alex Foris, Mrs. Kardossy, Mrs. Risko, George Fury. Ten Dollars each: John Bonifert, Frank Berninger. Dollars Alexander Nagy.",
                "So at the first meeting there came $1,550, as donations. The enthusiasm and the splendid willingness gives foundation to the hope, that the necessary amount will be brought together in a very short time."

                "This Sunday Burnside was the seat of a magnificent festival. The South Side Reformed Church celebrated the completion of a quarter century of existence. The whole congregation, children as well as grownups, had been making preparations of all kinds for this festival for several months, and their efforts were crowned with the tremendous success which they had earned. A festival of joy was this for the members of the Reformed Church of the South Side, but at the same time it was a joyous festival for all the Hungarians of Chicago and vicinity, who came together to admire the splended achievement of their brother Hungarians.",
                "The public gathered in vast numbers, regardless of creed, thereby confounding those who babble about the curse of Turan, since they demonstrated in fact that there is harmony among Hungarians so long as the Hungarians stand alone.",
                "This splendid harmony it was which helped the Reformed Hungarians of the South Side achieve their superb success, the achievement of their ambition cherished since the beginning of the year: to free the church from debt by the time of the jubilee.",
                "The grandiose festival, which will remain forever in the memory of the South Side, was begun by a festive divine service on Sunday at 10:30 A.M. The prelude on the organ was played by Mrs. Stephen E. Balogh, and the Reformed Church choir of East Chicago sang an anthem translated from English into Hungarian by Mrs. Joseph Kocskemethy. The choir of the church also sang very well under the able leadership of Miss Anna Melegh, deaconess. Miss Ethel Revesz played several organ solos. Among the Reformed Church clergymen present, from Chicago and vicinity were the Reverend Messrs. Alexander Mircse of Indiana Harbor, Gregor Garay of South Chicago, Joseph Kecskemethy of East Chicago, and Benjamin Jozsa of Joliet; and the minister of the neighboring St. Vincent M. E. Church, the Reverend J. C. Yemm, was also present.",
                "After the church service the gathering formed itself into an imposing procession, in which the delegations of all the different associations marches with flying colors to the strains of Szepessy's band to the banquet in the Hungarian House.",
                "The public was evidently surprised and pleased at the sight of the tastefully arranged table decorated with flowers, where everything sparkled with cleanliness and order. Their second surprise was the self-disciplined co-ordination and co-operation with which the young ladies of the Church received the guests, and without hesitation or inquiry everybody was led to his designated place.",
                "During the dinner the serving proceeded in the utmost silence and with the greatest care. We do not know who planned this banquet with such thoughtfulness, but whoever he or she may be, the organizer deserves the greatest credit, and the arrangement itself could serve as an example for everybody in the future.",
                "As soon as the public was seated in the banquet hall, the pastor of the church greeted those present through the microphone and asked the Reverend Arpad Bakay, of Gary, to serve as master of ceremonies and the Reverend Dr. Julius Melegh to pronounce the blessing. The traditional Csigaleves (soup with noodles made like snails), the excellent fried chicken, the stuffed cabbage, and the delicious cakes, made by the blessed hands of skilled Hungarian women, promptly won the favor of the public, which consumed them with delight. After the meat course the festival speeches began to flow, and they lasted until 5 P. M. During the meal Szepessy's band played some music, but the Hungarian folk songs sung by the church choir, composed entirely of second-generation Hungarians and led by Deaconess Arne Melegh, were most heartily received by the public. For these songs the piano accompaniment was furnished by Miss Ethel Revesz. William J. Boros, professor of mathematics and son of the Reverend Eugene Boros, late minister of this church, played the violin with the skill of a real virtuoso, which he is, and the playing of Bela Olah was also favorably received. The public also had the opportunity of enjoying the really artistic compositions of Alexander Rudnyansky, rendered by the excellent Hungarian pianist and composer himself, and in his songs one could easily detect the real soul of the Hungarians.",
                "Among the speeches was one delivered by the Honorable Ladislas Medgyessy, royal Hungarian consul, containing the message of our native country and praised the achievement of the South Side Church in maintaining Hungarian sentiment in second-generation Hungarian-Americans. Among others present at the banquet were Representative John G. Ryan, James J. Sullivan, Democratic committeeman, and Michael P. Mulcahy, alderman of the Eighth Ward, who all spoke very highly of the Hungarians in general and of the members of the church in particular. Most favorably received was the speech of the Reverend George Thegze, the Greek Catholic priest of Hammond, with its humorous tone, in which he proposed that the members should create a lasting memorial to this festive year by Christening one baby from each family in the church in the course of the year following.",
                "There was endless applause when Mr. Abel de Haan, president of the firm of Finn and Company, handed over the paid-up mortgage bonds and the deed. The speeches were opened by greetings to the public by Mr. Steve Beluscsak, vice-presbyter, who spoke in lieu of Mr. Geza Jozsa, the head presbyter. Later on in the name of the Reformed Church of East Chicago, John Jolsvay, presbyter, delivered that Church's greeting. Other speakers were Joseph Berceli, president of the South Side Federation of Churches and Associations, Spencer E. Johnson, president of the Chesterfield Commercial Club, Dr. Julius Melegh, district director of the American Reformed Association, Joseph Sebestyen, presbyter of the West Side Reformed Church, Frank Kovach, presbyter of the Greek Catholic Church, Dr. Bela Balas, president of the Hungarian Society, Frank Harsanyi, presbyter of the Reformed Church of South Chicago, John Balazs, president of the Tarsalgo, Charles Tarjanyi, president of the Burnside Workers' Aid Association, Andrew Lakatos, presbyter of the Reformed Church of Whiting, Lorant Gyorffy, organizer of the Verhovay Aid Association of the Twenty-seventh District, Mrs. Emery Santha, president of the Hungarian Ladies' Sick Benefit and Social Association, Mrs. Paul K.

Nemeth, recorder of Branch 84 of the Reformed Association, Mrs. Benjamin Bozsvay, president of the Reformed Church Ladies' Association, Mrs. Barna Kollath, president of the Young Ladies' Society, and Mrs. John Kotan, teacher in the Sunday school. In the name of the youth of the Church, Miss Anna Melegh spoke very nicely.",
                "The first presbyter of the church, Mr. Joseph Gasparik, its second presbyter, Samuel Beluscsak, and the third presbyter, Paul Szabo, Senior, related some interesting episodes out of the church's past.",
                "Dr. Ernest Loevinger, section chief of the Chicago Health Department, spoke about his connection with the South Side Church through his close friendship with the first pastor of the church, the late Reverend Aladar Jezernitzky. Frank Kovach, the director of the Hungarian Hour of Radio Station WIND, Cornelius Szakatits of the Hungarian Family Hour of WWAE, and Henry Gross of the Hungarian Hour of WHIP delivered their greetings to the jubilee. Emery Frank of the Hungarian Daily Szabadsag, Frank Kalman of Interest, Ignacio Izsak of Iras, and Bert Kalnay of the Magyar Tribune presented their good wishes for the further progress of the church.",
                "There were many more speakers on the list, but since the hour was so far advanced, many of the would-be orators renounced their claims to allow time for the young people to indulge in dancing. The speeches were concluded with those of the Reverend Stephen E. Balogh and Stephen Szabo, presbyter, in which they heartily thanked the public for its participation in the festivities of their church."

Those persons were guided by the thought that if the Czechs, the Germans, and the Scandinavians have their own national cemeteries, why could the Hungarians not have one of their own? They sold nearly 125 lots to the Hungarians. There are many who have already paid in full the price of the lots. A small percentage, on account of the depression, have not yet been able to liquidate their obligations, but the Company is willing to wait for the payments. The management, in order to learn whether the Hungarians really do care to have their deceased ones rest in a Hungarian cemetery and to have their graves perpetually cared for, called a meeting of some interested persons for March 8, so that in accordance with the information received from them it might decide what further steps should be taken. The representatives of the various creeds expressed their belief that the Hungarians would be proud to have an independent cemetery.

However, in any case, the body, once buried, cannot be disturbed.",

Their brave determination to try the hitherto impossible has gained them many adherents among such of their countrymen as have become acquainted with their project. In one week's time those in sympathy with the cemetery idea have contracted and paid for enough land to enable the sponsors of the idea to take an option on eight thousand and four hundred lots in one of Chicago's oldest and most beautiful cemeteries. It is now up to the Chicago Hungarians to continue successfully the work that has been begun.",

This celebration of March will have a twofold meaning in the history of the Chicago Hungarians, inasmuch as it not only commemorates the date of our declaration of independence (March 15, 1848) but also marks the date of the founding of the Hungarian Cemetery.",

                "Among our Hungarian people there are some very active churches that play a very important part in Hungarian society. For this reason we think that the Magyar Tribune should say something about the installation of the minister in the Hungarian Reformed Church of the West Side.",
                "There has always been a reformed church on the West Side and they have had a minister to serve them. The minister was Reverend Eugene Boros of the Burnside Hungarian Reformed Church. This West Side Hungarian Reformed Congregation now feels that they can support their own minister. They have selected a man who is not only interested in spreading Calvinistic faith among the Hungarian people of Chicago, but he is also interested in the social life of the Chicago Hungarian people as a whole.",
                "We do not know Reverend Julius M. Hanko, the new minister, very well, but everything we have heard about him is very favorable. Without praising this man any further, the writer has some personal information in regard to the Hungarian reformed system of education. Reverend Hanko was educated in a Hungarian high school and college, and he realizes what a real education he received not only religiously, for he was also taught to be interested in all Hungarian activities regardless of religion, as long as these activities were for the common interest of the Hungarian people.",
                "So we naturally feel that the Chicago Hungarian population has gained a very worthy member in the person of Reverend Julius M. Hanko.",

                "We want to announce now, before we go any further, that we are writing this in a very serious manner, and we are not trying to pick out any one individual to praise or to criticize.",
                "In our great city of Chicago there are three active Hungarian Reformed Churches, one in Burnside where Reverend Eugene Boros is the pastor, one in South Chicago where Reverend Gero Garav presides, and one on the West Side where we have the new minister, Reverend Julius M. Hanko. It is a very notable achievement to have three Hungarian Reformed Churches in three different parts of the city spreading the strength of the Hungarian cultural life for the benefit of all Hungarians in Chicago.",
                "A church can not be established unless it has a membership, capable leaders, and a minister. In the United States it is very important that the Hungarian people have good ministers, because here they are the ones who hold the congregation together by their own efforts, and it is through the efforts of these ministers that churches are established.",
                "The members of the Chicago Hungarian Reformed Church were in very bad shape when Reverend Eugene Boros came here from Gary, Indiana. As we look back into the history of the Hungarian Reformed people of Chicago, we will note that they have advanced steadily since Reverend Eugene Boros became the pastor of the churches in Chicago.",
                "The development of the Hungarian Reformed Church in Chicago is outstanding because, if we consider the number of Hungarian Roman Catholic people in Chicago, they will outnumber the Reformed people two to one, and yet they can only show us one Hungarian Catholic Church, while the Hungarian Reformed people are proud to say that they have three well-established and well-organized churches in Chicago.",
                "There is only one activity which shows us that the Hungarian Roman Catholic people are still active, and that is the fact that it was their idea to build that great social center, the Hungarian Home.",

We are fully satisfied that the Hungarian Reformed Churches have served the Hungarian people of Chicago impartially and in true Hungarian spirit. Therefore, we take this opportunity to congratulate Reverend Eugene Boros for his great work among the Hungarian people in Chicago."

                "The writer of this column has been a resident of Chicago for quite some time, and has sorrowfully followed the activities and services rendered the Chicago Hungarian Roman Catholic people, and has noted that the Hungarian Roman Catholics of the North Side of Chicago are seriously in need of a parish which would tie these Hungarians closer to the religious life and the teachings of Christ. A few months ago I read an article in the Magyar Tribune, which was written by Father Lipot Mosonyi; this article gave a very clear picture of the situation as it exists in Chicago today. Dr. Mosonyi pointed out very concretely the need for a Hungarian Roman Catholic church on the North Side of Chicago. A church to these people would not only be of moral importance, but would also bring them closer together socially.",
                "At that time I gave Dr. Mosonyi credit for his declaration and I felt that every good Catholic felt the same way about this matter, and that with a little effort a Hungarian Catholic parish could be realized. The truth about the matter is that those Hungarian Roman Catholics living on the North Side of Chicago could build a beautiful parish which would be a credit to the Hungarian population of Chicago.",
                "Naturally these possibilities would depend on the type of priest that would be put here, because these plans cannot be achieved through fanaticism, but may be accomplished by the teaching of the gospel in the name of Christ.",
                "Dr. Lipot Mosonyi was in Chicago a short time ago with the idea of organizing a parish on the North Side of Chicago. In a personal letter to me, he informed me that he had tried to contact Father Soltesz. He asked Father Soltesz of the Burnside Hungarian Roman Catholic church, to help the Hungarian Roman Catholic people of the North Side in their work to organize a parish of their own.",
                "It is a sad situation, but Father Soltesz was afraid that his financial income might be endangered, and he simply turned his head and declared that there were not enough Hungarian Roman Catholic people on the North Side, and a Hungarian parish was unnecessary. This poor hungry priest even went so far as to inform his immediate superior, the monsignor, in order that the idea might never go further.",
                "Does this represent the teachings of Christ? Is this what Christ would have done? When a priest deals this way with his brothers, because he is financially hungry, it is detrimental to the Hungarian Catholic population of Chicago. Christ told us to love thy neighbor as thyself. This commandment cannot be found anywhere in the principles of Father Soltesz.",
                "Instead of love, hatred is practiced by this man who is only playing the part of a priest. How blessed his work is can readily be seen by his activities when he forced Father Farkas out of this parish, and the people were divided into two factions. The real Christians are those who can't forget that Father Soltesz literally forced Father Farkas out, although the personalities of those two men are very different.",
                "I could tell my Romen Catholic brothers much more about this matter, and if Father Soltesz would like me to tell more, I would be only too glad to do so.",
                "The idea of writing this editorial struck me when on March 9 I attended the funeral services of a very good Hungarian Catholic friend. The quality of this service was far below the quality of the usual Hungarian Catholic funeral services.",
                "I once asked Father Soltesz what the spiritual effects would be if he were the really fancy robes instead of the plainer and lighter ones, during funeral services. His very plain and simple answer was that there was no difference; he said that I shouldn't for a moment think that he would wear those robes which were much heavier and much more beautiful unless he were adequately paid for it. This is the way we stand, my doer Hungarian Catholic brothers, with regard to our priest whose jealous attitude is an obstacle to us.",
                "I have been thinking of writing this editorial for years, but now this North Side funeral and the articles that were written by Dr. Lipot Mosonyi have forced me to take my pen in hand. The respectable Hungarians of Burnside have known me for quite some time, and they know very well that I am familiar with the circumstances which tore them away from Father Farkas who was replaced by Father Soltesz. The Hungarian Catholics did not like this move; this can be seen by the number of Hungarian Catholics who attend services at the Irish Catholic Church in that locality.",
                "I do not want to bother Father Soltesz's quiet and fattening life in Burnside, but I do protest in the name of the Hungarian Roman Catholics of the North Side against his forcing himself upon us and especially upon the Archbishop. He can keep his flock in Burnside; we do not know him and we do not want to become acquainted with him.",
                "We want an ideal priest of Christ and not a priest who is only interested in getting fat and accumulating great wealth and is anti-Christ."

                "Twenty-six thousand souls would make a fair sized city in Hungary. We must also take into consideration that the Hungarians in Chicago are mostly adults, because their children were born here. For the past ten years immigration has been low, but in addition to this 26,000 there are many of our countrymen, who are from pre-war Hungary, which would swell this total considerably. Most of our Hungarians take active part in social activities.",
                "The leaders of social life among the Hungarians are their Societies and newspapers. We all know of these. Of just as great importance are the Hungarian churches. We find three Reformed churches and one Roman Catholic church. We know the important role churches have in the life of Americans as well as other nationalities. The church is the most important institution of foreigners. Americans take note of a nation through their churches. Around the churches, schools and societies are formed. The Hungarian church is the haven of Hungarian culture and speech in a foreign land.",
                "Those who belong to the church are better people. They learn to appreciate their families, educate their children. It is the patriotic duty of the Hungarians to have as many churches as possible.",
                "Has Chicago enough Hungarian Catholic churches? The church on the Burnside can only take care of those few Hungarians, who live south of 40th Street. No one can expect people to travel two hours to church and two hours back. For this reason, the Burnside church has a membership of only 300 families of which 100 families are Polish. The 200 families total more than 1,000 souls. How about the other ten or more thousands of Hungarian Catholics? Where do they go to church?",
                "It is a fact that 60% of post-war Hungary is Catholic, so that there are 15,600 Hungarian Catholics in Chicago today. Some of these are German Hungarians, who belong to St. Michael and St.Joseph German Catholic churches. Discounting this number, there are still 12,000 immigrant Hungarian Catholics, who need a Hungarian church.",
                "The Slovaks have seven Catholic churches. Why shall the Hungarians have only one? There are two Hungarian Catholic churches in South Bend, in Cleveland there are three. Every Hungarian regardless of his religion, feels the injustice of the position of the Chicago Hungarian Catholics. How shall we organize the Hungarian Catholic Church on the North Side?",
                "1. Let us realize that we spend a certain amount of money on churches. This amount could be given toward the support of a Hungarian Catholic church.",
                "2. Many of us would gladly give more money to a Hungarian Catholic Church, to be able to pray and sing in Hungarian, to have the last sacrament administered in our own language.",
                "3. The North Side societies should discuss among themselves, organize groups, gather the names of the people, and hold meetings.",
                "4. Appoint a committee to go to the Archbishop with a list of the names of Hungarian Catholics, and pledge support to such a church.",

This tendency becomes apparent in the naturalization procedure, which has been made a regular stumbling block.....",
                "It must be stated that the new registration law does not affect citizens officially. However, in practice the immigrant is subject to thousands of indignities.

By these immigrants we mean not those who came to this country illegally--these unfortunates know that they may be caught at any time--but those who have no way of proving how, when, and where they gained entry.",
                "Tens of thousands of immigrants cannot become citizens because they are unable to prove their entry. Therefore, thousands of aliens can be molested, blackmailed, and deported without a comeback. Nothing can be done in Michigan to change this law. It takes years in this country to pass a law, but it takes even longer to repeal it. We cannot expect the repeal of a law which is designed to persecute immigrants and which is therefore quite popular in this country.....",
                "We must take steps to organize an effective resistance, so that other states will not enact similar legislation. The lawmakers can be influenced by two factors: the voters' expressed wishes and [their own] self-interest.....We must, therefore, mobilize the votes so that the politicians will take notice.",
                "At the next election, the naturalized citizen must ask each candidate whether he intends to support such [anti-alien] legislation. If a bill of this nature is introduced before the legislature, each foreign-language organization, newspaper, and individual voter must act and bring pressure upon the lawmakers--with telegrams, letters, committees--warning them that if they vote for the measure they will lose our votes.....",
                "In most localities the need for a joint committee of the Hungarian organizations was recognized and now we must strive to co-operate with the committees of other national groups as well, because we all will be affected by the persecution of foreigners. We must do this now and not at the last minute, when it may be too late.",
                "Our daily bread and our personal liberty are at stake, and if in defense of our interests we cannot co-operate with one another and with other national groups, we deserve to be persecuted.....",
                "It is useless to write more about this subject. If there is anyone who still does not feel the ground burning under his feet after contemplating what has happened in Michigan, he will never realize the danger until it stares him in the face."

They were Joseph Molnar, Joseph Fulop, Emery Orosz, Charles Zadetzky, Andrew Kozma, John Varga and a few others who stopped in for a glass of wine, and for a friendly chat.",
                "Hungarians were diligent, hard workers. Although the wages were rather low, the cost of living was cheap, but they could put away or send some money to the old country.",
                "From the saved money, the Hungarian business originated, and every dollar sent abroad aroused the desire for emigration.",
                "The emigrants were no longer afraid of the long journey, and of the sea, neither did they consider America a strange country, because they knew that there lived many Magyars, who would help them through the difficulties of the beginning. In Chicago, Joseph Byfield, the owner of the Hotel Sherman, was the benefactor of many immigrants.",

                "Later, as they stayed in this country longer, the Hungarians realized that they had to adjust themselves to the American environment and to settle down, if only temporarily, but it would take a few years to reach their goal; to buy land, to earn enough money to build a house, or to send for the lonely wife in the Old Country.",
                "Then, the American-Magyars began to think about church and social organization.",

The editorial says that immigrants from countries like Italy, Russia, Poland, and Hungary--in addition to the fact that they have other undesirable qualities--are not wanted here because for years they have tolerated dictatorship and for this reason they are unfit, politically unripe, to become residents and eventually citizens of a democratic country like the United States.",

We can see our dear Hungarian people dressed in their native attire hurrying to church. It is Christmas. Our mind is preoccupied with the soul-stirring thought that on this beautiful holiday, the holiday on which love was born, the worst man in the world yearns to do some good deed. The worst criminal in the world looks back at his childhood days and thinks of his mother, and automatically his hands are clasped in prayer. It is Christmas!",
                "This is the way in which we emigrant Hungarians dream of our former happiness. We wait for children to come and sing Christmas carols under our windows, and to make our dreams complete, we can hear a church bell in the distance. It does not sound like those which we used to hear back in our native land. We look out the window, and we awaken from our beautiful dream, for the bell that we heard turns out to be that of a locomotive passing by. Under our windows we see our Hungarian brothers pass, some coming home and others going to work. The day is dark and dreary, and the air is full of smoke. The only way that we can tell that it is Christmas is to look at the calendar.",
                "There is a newspaper on the table; the name of it is A Het (The Week), and its editor is Geza Kende. We start to read it; we are attracted by a piece entitled \"The Witches' Kitchen\". It deals with two Hungarian Catholic priests in Hungarian-American communities and the fight that has been going on between them. With sad and tearful eyes we read about the unbecoming behavior of these two Catholic clergymen. Our hearts are broken when we think that we Hungarians took the wanderer's staff in our hands; it was the unfairness of our lot [in Hungary] which caused us to emigrate to America, this vast prison, where every one must suffer for his sins if he has any. This is where the struggle for bread will clear one's conscience. And we who have no country, instead of loving and respecting one another, display greed and selfishness toward [our fellow Hungarians]! This greed and this selfishness hurt us. And those who are setting us such an example are the very ones who should be assuaging the terrible distress in which we exist--those who will ascend to the pulpit on Christmas morning and proclaim, \"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will to men!\"",
                "We turn the pages, and another article attracts our attention. \"A Comical Play about Hungarian-Americans\" is the title of this piece. It is indeed a sad situation when comedies are written about us poor disillusioned Hungarian-Americans! Well, we read it. It is Menyhert Lengyel, the famous dramatic writer, whose works have been translated into other languages, and whose plays are known to all civilized nations. Lengyel, the famous Hungarian writer, has written a comedy about Hungarian-Americans! In this play he derides them just because a few thousand have returned to Hungary with fairly large sums of money and are taking advantage of their American citizenship. The name of the play is \"The Battle of Waterloo\".",
                "Cannot you see, you poor Hungarian-Americans, that one of the greatest Hungarian writers has taken you and impaled you on the tip of his pen? Those whom he is writing about are those who during the war and after it aided poverty-stricken Hungary and its people. Lengyel, the great writer, belittles and derides them in this comical play that he has written. The whole world will laugh at us.",
                "Yet the character of the Hungarian-American is not to be likened to that of the immigrant who comes here to save money and then hurries back with it to aid the \"old country,\" where he becomes the victim of swindlers of all sorts. Some of these swindlers and cheats have reached very deeply into the pockets of some of the despised Hungarians who have returned to their native land with good intentions. These people should be pitied, not ridiculed.",
                "But if Hungarian-Americans do not come to their senses soon, then Menyhert Lengyel will be proved correct when he belittles them in the eyes of the world.",
                "These sad thoughts must be cast aside. Hungarians! In this dream of ours let us produce some real Christmas thoughts. For the first lady of every true Hungarian's heart is right here among us--Countess Karolyi. Let us think about her! She is the granddaughter of a man who was one of the most loyal followers of the Hapsburgs, Count Gyula Andrassy. Countess Karolyi was disowned by her family for remaining faithful to her husband when his property was confiscated, and he was driven into exile, because he was fighting for the freedom of the Hungarian nation. Hungarian-Americans did nothing to help this great man in distress because those who drove him out made sure that the more influential Hungarians in this country should not be able to do anything about it. Finally, however, the Hungarian-Americans became restive, and decided to alleviate the sufferings of Mihaly Karolyi and to make arrangements for a tour of this country for his wife, so that she might personally enlighten the American public concerning the injustice inflicted upon her husband, who had put a stop to unjustifiable bloodshed and had driven the Hapsburgs off the throne of Hungary--those same Hapsburgs who for the last four hundred years have oppressed the Hungarian people.",
                "Hungarian-Americans! On this sacred holiday of Christmas we cannot cherish a more beautiful thought than that of Countess Karolyi, who left her husband on a sick bed and her children in poverty to come here to save a nation from destruction. She came here at the request of the largest republic in the world, the United States. She is a pilgrim here among us on this sacred Christmas holiday. She probably thinks of her sick husband with tears in her eyes. Hungarian-Americans! If this grand Hungarian lady comes to visit you, take her in your arms lovingly and caress her, for it will heal that heart of hers which has been torn to shreds by the suffering which she has endured.",
                "If your hearts are filled with these thoughts, your Christmas holiday, even though you are far away from your native land, should be a day of joy and contentment, and it will surely be a holy day in your hearts."

                "The Hungarian immigration problem is a rather new problem. Hardly fifty years have passed since Hungarian immigration has been of any consequence at all. During the years directly preceding the World War, Hungarian immigration quota reached its height. Immediately after the World War, emigration from Hungary to the United States reached its peak again, but laws were enacted and quotas were set, which lessened the immigration work somewhat. The immigration laws of 1924 lowered the Hungarian quota to a minimum.",
                "When we speak of Hungarian-Americans, we must divide them into two groups; namely, those who immigrated before the War, and those who immigrated after the War. There is a great difference between the so-called old Hungarian-American and the new Hungarian-American. We find such a great difference between these two classes that it almost seems incredible. The first Hungarian immigration was caused by political activities in Hungary. So we can regard those immigrants who came to this country fifty or sixty years ago as political refugees. During the ten years previous to the War, economic conditions caused emigration from Hungary in large numbers, and naturally these immigrants were those who were hardest hit by economic conditions. During the ten years previous to the War, the immigrants from Hungary were the ordinary tillers of the soil, the peasant type, those who were accustomed to hard work, and these came in great numbers.",
                "We are now speaking of proven facts that after the World War the large majority of emigrants from Hungary were the better educated class in comparison to those who came previous to the War.",
                "In spite of the fact that the old immigrated Hungarian-Americans were tillers of the soil in the old country, upon their arrival here, they sought the faster moving and easier jobs in the factories. We will find very few Hungarian immigrants on farms. Naturally, the larger majority of them have settled in and around manufacturing centers, in certain industries such as: iron, steel, and in cotton mills where some are excellent workers.",
                "The old Hungarian-Americans were very slow in Americanizing themselves, quite unlike those who arrived in the more recent years. In some instances, we can still find the same Hungarian life existing in Hungarian societies which existed previous to the War, although the social life of the Hungarian-Americans has slowly changed. If we would study the different Hungarian communities in the United States, we would find non-sectarian sick benefit, religious, and theatrical societies, but among them we would note that the older immigrated Hungarians have very few representatives in these societies. They have been replaced by those immigrants who arrived in this country more recently, and those who possess the will and ability to share the worries and cares of organizational work. They have become tireless workers, because most of these people work hard during the day, and devote their spare time to work for the common interest of the Hungarians.",
                "The old Hungarian societies which were originally organized to create jobs of a common interest are still in existence. In considering the number of new and old immigrants and their activities, there is no comparison. The newly arrived immigrants are instilling new blood and new strength into the veins of the social life of the Hungarian-Americans, while the old immigrant is satisfied with his present state.",
                "Another fact which should be given attention concerns those immigrants who were very slow in becoming Americanized. They remained pure Hungarians for a long while after arriving here, and many could not speak the English language. It was seldom that one could meet a native Hungarian who could speak the English language fluently.",
                "Today, we find that immigrants who have arrived in this country a few months ago able to speak English fairly well. We are certain that within a very short time these people will be able to speak English very well.",
                "Since the World War, immigration laws have been enacted with many restrictions. Very often it is necessary for those who have made known their intention to come to this country to remain in the old country for two or three months longer, and during this time, they decided to learn the English language. After being in the United States for one or two years, it would not be unusual to see these immigrants reading English newspapers.",
                "It is interesting to note the ease with which these Hungarian immigrants adopt the customs and habits of this new land, while the old Hungarian immigrants took decades to change, or never adapted themselves to American society. The new Hungarian immigrant has found it much easier to break into the social life of the American people.",

                "The honorable consul's prediction has come true, because in the past two years sixteen learned young doctors have come to Chicago from Hungary. Most of these have opened their own offices, probably not earning a great deal at the present time, but they have high hopes for the future. We feel that we should single out one in particular, and that is Dr. Tivadar Koppanyi, who came to this country through an invitation extended to him by the University of Chicago to accept a position as professor of biology. Doctor Koppanyi is only twenty-three years old but has already gained recognition in his particular field. The daily American press has already expressed their recognition of the achievements of this young doctor.",
                "Another immigrant, Doctor Szekely, is a consulting doctor at the nearby Napierville Tuberculosis Sanitarium. Doctor Klinger is a surgeon at the Western Electric Company's hospital. Doctor Zeisler, one of the youngest doctors from Hungary, has been placed in the dispensary of the Michael Reese Hospital, devoting himself to the study of internal ailments.",

We are interested in the fact that the landless Magyars living in America were entirely ignored when the bill was drawn up. The healthy agricultural life was the only thing that could draw the Magyar-American back to his native country. The Magyar-Americans would be more inclined to return to Hungary if they were certain that the government of their native country wanted to make the purchase of Hungarian land easier for the returning Magyars, so that the big landowners could no longer take their hard-earned money away.",
                "But the price of land in Hungary is higher than in the United States, even if the price were paid in dollars. The taxes, assessments, requisitions, and property redemptions are so heavy that the farm earnings, on some pretext or other, have to be handed in to the state treasury.",

This committee is to meet the Magyar-Americans at the eastern depot in Budapest. We read in a cable of last week that the Reception Committee is carefully watching for the returning Magyar-Americans....The communication says that two Magyar-Americans were lured by impostors from the depot into a nearby forest, where they were robbed of their money and killed. Any emigrant to Hungary may expect a similar reception.",
                "We mentioned in our issue of February 4 the horrible war reparations imposed by the Supreme Council of the Allies. For forty-two years, a certain percentage of every German workingman's pay will be appropriated for war reparations. A German expert has calculated that every German workingman is compelled to work fourteen hours daily to make it possible for the country to pay off the war reparations.",
                "Hungary, in spite of the territorial losses imposed on her, cannot avoid the war reparations either. As soon as the Allies finish with Germany, they will deal with Austria-Hungary. The Allies will not spare her either, and we are afraid that they will deal more mercilessly with Hungary than they have with Germany.",
                "Hungary has hardly any gold. According to the present value of the korona, she does not possess even one gram of gold, and the German mark is eight to nine times higher than the Hungarian korona on the exchange market.",
                "No matter how small an amount the Allies fix as a war debt for Hungary, it will be so burdensome that every Hungarian workingman, through a whole generation, and perhaps through a whole century, will groan under the burden.",
                "Every Magyar who is preparing to return to Hungary should realize that he and his children must work for years to liquidate the war debt, if he wants to live in Hungary. Therefore, it is much wiser to wait here in this country until circumstances change. Then we will be able to help our loved ones come to this country."

Today in Hungary one can get 20 crowns for a dollar instead of five as in the past. Possessing large sums of American money these emigrants become wealthy people in Hungary. This is one of the principal reasons causing the Hungarian people to go back home.",

Hungary is a country that was very badly defeated, and unfortunately received the shortest end of the spoils of the war. This advice was given to our readers with sincere intentions and with nothing else in mind.",

This man had acquired for himself a small fortune in this country, and decided that he and his family would go back to Hungary. His entire family, with the exception of his oldest daughter who had become devoted to modes and customs of America, returned to Hungary.",

He had saved $5,000 and had taken this money back to Hungary in order to aid his aging parents. This man had hardly exchanged greetings with his folks when they drafted him. They took his money away, and under no circumstances will they release him.",
                "The futures of people leaving this country can be better explained by the men who censor the letters that come from Hungary to the United States.",
                "As time goes on, in all probability, definite changes will take place in the economic and political setup of Hungary. The crown will in all probability go back to its proper value, but people will just have to wait patiently, and a long time for this readjustment.",
                "We must remember that for the past six years Hungary has seen nothing but destruction going on within its boundaries. It would be fortunate for Hungary if within the next six years, this economic and political destruction which has hit the entire nation could be remedied.",
                "Today we cannot see the slightest indication of any steps being taken to correct this condition. Today destructive powers still hold the upper hand in Hungary. Our patience must not give out.",

                "The Hungarians are leaving the United States daily in large numbers. They are not paying attention to the propaganda that is being spread by foreign consuls, nor are they minding the high cost of traveling. The people who are leaving this country do not seem especially pleased that they are able to emigrate. There is a rather disgusted, yet determined look on their faces. To us these people remind us of a part of a Hungarian patriotic song by Vorosmarty, which is in part: \"In the great world outside, there is no place for you. You may be blessed or you may be cursed by the hand of fate, but you will have to live and die here.\" Who would have believed that there was so much truth in Vorosmarty's words. This truth is clearly demonstrated by the fact that so many Hungarians are now leaving this country.",
                "During the time of peace, efforts were made to win these people to the farmlands of this country, but it was without success. The Hungarian worker accepted employment under the most hazardous conditions. He was not afraid of work or even of death, but he did not want to bind himself exclusively to farming here. There were a few Hungarians who purchased farms in Canada and in the United States, but now that they have a chance to return to the homeland, the majority of them are selling their farms and going back to Hungary. These loyal Hungarians are doing this with the best motives in mind to protect their country for which their forefathers shed precious blood.",
                "There were some political factions who wished to divide Hungary, but what right have they to say what shall be done. It is the working people whom the Hungarians have protected, provided with a better living and more comfortable homes. We Hungarian-Americans are good examples.",
                "We have been immigrating to this country for the past twenty-five years and have helped to build it. What is our reward? This, my dear friends, has been our reward: We Hungarians have never asked for Hungarian schools to be built, nor have we asked for any favors, but we are still being considered as belonging to the lower class of people. Whose idea it is or where did it originate that we should be like the hunted animals of the wilds. For the past six years our people have experienced nothing but hard struggles in order that their work would be recognized, but instead of being recognized and respected they are literally being kicked around. This is the reason the Hungarians are leaving America. They are leaving by the thousands now, but soon they will leave by the hundred thousands.",
                "If we were told that happiness exists only in fairy tales in the land to which we are going, we would not believe it. What are they going back there for now? They want to see what has happened to their native country since the Powers have been so ambitious to gain supremacy. It is a well-known fact that Hungary was the last nation who agreed to enter the War in Europe. Yet the Hungarians must suffer most. Everybody wants to kick and cut this nation to pieces. In spite of all this the Hungarians are emigrating from this country because they are still true to their homeland and cannot believe that it has been taken away from them. Those who are going back have no definite plans. They do not know whether they are returning to their homeland to live or to die. Their only reason for leaving is that they know something unfair has happened to Hungary and there is trouble there.",
                "In order to become familiar with the thoughts and motives responsible for this emigration, we have talked with some of the emigrants. We advised them not to make the trip because of the great suffering endured there. We received a very simple answer. They said that if those who are there are suffering, they would go and help them suffer. They said they were needed there. Some had left their parents, wives, husbands, and children. It was inspiring to hear some men among them who talked more openly and bravely. They say they are going over there to fight in order to win back their homeland. We will have to leave these Hungarians to do as they wish because we cannot hold them back. We agree with these emigrants whose determination for justice is shown when they say they will not be persecuted any longer nor robbed of their savings in the bold manner in which it is done in this country through misinterpretation of the laws.",
                "It is not our fault that Hungarians in this country are so degraded. Our efforts to Americanize them are completely wasted. A new paper can appear every day with articles advising these people to learn the English language, or other articles may appear concerning Americanization. They are sure to ignore them. They are determined to return to Hungary because they feel that their homeland is in danger and needs their help. It is true that such mass emigration will be of a disadvantage to America. Certain states having large Hungarian colonies have already felt the effects of the emigration. There are many thousands of Hungarian coal miners and steel workers in this country. They constitute the industrial life of America. Soon its industrial centers will be closed. Foreign born people are emigrating in great numbers, thereby imperiling the industrial life of the nation. To those Hungarians who have turned their backs on America, business means very little to them. While they were residents here they were degraded and discriminated against, which accounts largely for their desire to leave. Life or death, they do not care. They are going back because they feel they are needed most in Hungary. While in America, they were not given much protection nor liked very well. If there had been some capable leaders among the Hungarians, emigration among them would not have been so great. Efforts to educate the Hungarians would have made them understand that this country affords a good living for them and their families. The natural resources of this country are unlimited, and if the Hungarians had some efficient and influential representatives in their group their influence would be felt and the United States would help them in their efforts to stop the destruction of Hungary. Then it would not be necessary for the Hungarians of America to believe that the only way to regain the old Hungary is through bloodshed.",
                "The American-Hungarian leaders have used every available method to teach their people, but there is nothing left to do but to let these degraded Hungarians return to the country from whence they came. We will permit them to regain their beloved country for which they have worked and labored so long and hard."

The peace pact which was signed by Germany a few days ago apparently has increased the desire for emigration. It appears to us that many people will emigrate immediately. We also assume that out of the 1,300,000 foreigners, many will realize that back in their homeland there exist many disturbing and uncertain conditions, while the situation in the United States is certain and peaceful and one is assured of some comforts. They will realize that to leave this country now would be foolish and unprofitable.",

                "That means that approximately 3000 dollars a person would be taken to foreign countries. This wealth is sufficient proof that the Hungarian workingman has made a very good living in this country, especially in the last few years. During the war, wages were high, but they have remained the same to this day. In many localities, movements are being started to establish laws governing minimum wages for workers.",
                "The industries which were engaged in the manufacture of war equipment have been reorganized and the success of these industries is already having a favorable effect on this country. The United States receives the largest share of the benefit of this industrial reorganization, because this country is so far ahead of Europe in industrial development. Furthermore our wealth of natural resources will compete with any nation. The ruined European nations will be forced to buy their building materials and industrial equipment from this country. This will bring about increased employment opportunities in this country. Therefore, with these facts generally known the people of this country will be happier, their work will be easier, and opportunities for earning a good living will be assured. The unemployment situation in this country is already decreasing, due to the above-mentioned facts, as reported by the State Employment Agency.",
                "It is natural, therefore, that those people who only yesterday voiced their desire to emigrate to their homeland have changed their minds. They debate whether it is a wise thing to leave a land of certainty and go to a land of uncertainty where their small fortunes consisting only of money, would soon be spent and thereby increase their misery. At the present time emigration should be discouraged."

                "\"The people who will emigrate will take their savings with them.\"",
                "The bankers have estimated that the average emigrant will take from fifteen to twenty thousand dollars with him.",
                "It is estimated that four billion dollars will go out of the United States.",
                "There are two important connecting facts: the people who emigrate from this country at the present time are not socially or politically fitted for citizenship in the United States; their voluntary departure will be a very good thing for this country. Those foreigners who are more bold in their Communistic activities will be deported by this country, and other individuals will be put in jail.",
                "The money which they withdraw from banks, to take out of the country cannot be confiscated, without causing more serious trouble. The bankers want to stop this emigration, but this is to be deplored; just because they want to keep the money in this country, they must also seek to keep these \"undesirable foreigners\" here.",
                "This movement of emigration is angering people in the financial circles of this country. We can see that certain individuals would be glad to get rid of these immigrants, if they did not take their money with them. These people saved this money the hard way, and they are entitled to every penny they have saved. The four billion dollars which they will take out of this country is very negligible, compared to their contribution to the wealth of this country. And yet the financiers want them to leave their last drop of blood here.",
                "We do not think that the emigration will be as great as we are lead to believe. The immigrants know much more than the bankers think. These immigrants will not take a chance with their life savings. Especially those immigrants whose homelands are under the Communistic form of government.",
                "Regardless of how the situation turns out, it remains a fact that the emigrants will not oblige the bankers by leaving their lifes' savings in this country."

                "The United States is considered by the world as the melting pot of nations; but since the country declared war, immigration has practically stopped, making raw material rather limited for this gigantic melting pot. For instance, during the last twelve months only 400,000 immigrants have arrived which is only one third the number this country received during the fiscal year ended in June 1914. We must also consider the fact that the year previous to the war the immigration was at its height,with the exception of 1907, when one million and two hundred eighty five thousand immigrants entered this country. The war naturally caused the immigration to drop sharply and immigration authorities tell us that there will be a further drop.",
                "The population of the United States is decreasing not only because immigration is dropping, but also because emigration is increasing. The larger part of the emigrants is made up of those men who are going back to fight for the country from which they came. The number of emigrants practically matches that of the immigrants. This is about the only year in the history of the country that the population of the United States has not increased due to immigration.",
                "The melting pot is practically empty, and is not working as it would under ordinary conditions; but the work that it has done so far is good and of great importance. Today the United States means more to every foreign born resident than it has at any previous time; this includes the immigrants from the central powers of Europe. The war has brought the foreign born resident closer to the United States; the fusion in the melting pot has become more complete than ever before. The United States is not only a place where the immigrants are able to make a comfortable living; it is not merely a temporary abode, but a real home to them. The people living in the United States are United regardless of creed or nationality, and this condition is created by the war."

                "During the early part of the War it looked very much as though the central powers were going to win the war and out of this came the thought that many people would emigrate after the war was over. But now that the United States had entered the war, it has almost become an impossibility with the United States aiding the allies for Germany to win; she is standing with her back against the wall. The masses who believed that Germany would win the war previously have still some faith in the possibility that the war may he won by Germany, therefore, they have not given up the idea of emigration, and with this idea in mind,they believe that if the central powers win,there will be countless opportunities in the countries that claim victory.",
                "Without considering what will happen in this country if this emigration takes place, we must think of what conditions await the emigrants who arrive in these lands of opportunity. Emigration in such great volume as is predicted would be a terrible blow to this country, and its industries, but the right to emigrate cannot be denied those people who desire to do so. Enactment of laws to stop emigration also seems to be an impossibility. Probably the only way mass emigration can be stopped is by acquainting the people with the conditions that will exist in Central Europe, especially in Austria Hungary more so than in Germany. One must bear in mind that when we came to this country there was a reason for it, there must have been some fault or something we did not like about the social or economic system in the country from which we came.",
                "There is a very mistaken idea that, due to the great number of people lost in the war the entire central European set-up will change, and that it will offer countless opportunities.",
                "It is true that agriculture in Austria Hungary became a business proposition but when this happened this industry became mechanized and, therefore, threw a great number of men out of work. These men were soon absorbed by this country. Most of the people thinking of emigrating are those who before coming to this country were engaged in agriculture. The only condition under which these people should go back to their home countries would be if it were certain that there will be room for them in agriculture. This, however, is very questionable, and Hungary and the other central countries of Europe are not industrially inclined, therefore, it seems as though the people who are planning to leave this country have been somewhat misled.",
                "The land question is the most important question in Europe. There has been a great deal of blood shed in order that the land question might be solved.",
                "The continuation of revolts has proved that people do not value any one thing more dearly than land which has been taken away from them by force. These revolts have netted the people nothing because the landlords were always protected by an armed force.",
                "This war is being fought because it will test the strength of the soldiers or servants of the landlords. This does not only apply to the depressed people but concerns the entire world; that is the four countries of the world. If these junkers are defeated,and the only way they will be defeated, is by a victory on the part of the United States, then the people will have hopes of getting their lands back. This, of course, should not be misinterpreted to mean that just as soon as the war is over the land will be divided among the population. It would only be the start of a great social reform and will mean the death of the junkers. We must make this notation, however, that if the emigration from this country is too heavy, these landlords or junkers will use this as a tool to battle off those who have been seeking land.",
                "The emigration question is not a subject that should not be discussed; it is just the opposite; now is the time when the Hungarian masses should be fully informed of the problems of emigration. We must advise the people who are considering emigration, taking their interest whole heartedly or conscientiously, so they will not be victims of propaganda."

                "There is some question as to whether the supposition is true. Does it seem probable that the Hungarians emigrating from this country, will be respected as good workers, and can they expect a livable wage for their work? Why did we come to this country? Was it not because there were too many of us in Hungary and we could not make a living there?",
                "As we learned in school, the natural resources of Hungary are silver, iron ore, and coal and easy transportation by water. Our immigration to this country was therefore not caused by Hungary's not having sufficient natural resources. The real reason seems to be political and lack of general wealth among the people, also lack of general and technical education. On account of these facts many of the people became surplus population in their particular line of work,and if a man did get a job he was 'pushed around' and constantly reminded, that if he did not like his job there were many others who would like it. Most particularly was this true of the agricultural worker. Most of them worked long hours for very low wages. Hungary is an agricultural country and most of its farm implements are manufactured in foreign countries; therefore industry absorbs very few or none of the employables.",
                "About the only place where industry and mining thrive and develop is in the agricultural regions where the owners can obtain cheap and ignorant help. This situation brings about a wandering class of workers. This type of workers has a tendency to retard the development of both agriculture and industry. We would think that the working class of people are at fault, but there is also a certain percentage of professional men involved; they cannot find work due to the fact that in Hungary the industries are so far behind in development. Such was the picture before the war started.",
                "Even then the workers were beginning to realize that organization was necessary. They wanted shorter hours and more pay. But the Capitalists realized the ignorance of the people and created internal strife among them, so that these organizations were soon broken up.",
                "But now the war is nearing its end, and the people are fast realizing that they were not fighting and killing to save their own, but to save the property of those who had treated them so harshly. In Hungary the great land owners are the law makers and legislators. The people who fought for them must realize these facts, and they must demand their rights.",
                "The development of Hungary depends on the question of whether or not the people who fought in the war will have any rights. If the government provides regulations for livable wages for the agricultural workers, free press, and free and independent courts for the people, then perhaps the Hungarians in America might feel that it would be worth their while to go back to Hungary after the war is over."

His life has always been very clean, almost holy, and this, coupled with his unselfishness and devotion to his work, has earned him such an esteem as only few people, like Jane Addams and Graham Taylor, can boast.

Dr. Schreiner was a retired consul-general, formerly Hungarian Consul in Chicago.",
                "During the course of the investigation, it was found that Antal Haner, a young brick-layer, was the murderer. The cablegram went on to say that Hungarian villagers hate automobiles so much that this was the direct cause of the killing.",

                "The automobile has become a necessity to all classes of people here in America. Its manufacture provides the daily bread for a great many people. To try to kill, to hate, and persecute this most important invention of the twentieth century is as much as to hide oneself in a dark cellar, terrified by progress, detesting the rapidly developing technical civilization, and wishing to be back in the Middle Ages, jogging along in an ox cart.....",

                "We, too, believe that the peace treaty of Trianon is unjust. We are willing to do anything in our power to bring about its revision, as long as we don't come into conflict with American laws by doing so.",
                "We believe also that the Trianon treaty has affected the Hungarian people and has caused much suffering and privations to the Hungarian working class. The Trianon treaty is too stringent and cruel. In our opinion its revision is necessary, especially for the interests of millions of Hungarian workers.",
                "It is a well-known fact that the kettle of the revision movement is boiling again in Magyar-America, where different ambitions and efforts are striving for recognition.",

                "Always and everywhere we must declare that the movement for the revision of the Trianon treaty is not in the interests of Hungary's feudal lords and priesthood, but in behalf of the oppressed, impoverished Hungarian people. Furthermore, the movement stands for the establishment of a democratic form of government and the restoration to Hungary of Hungarian territories.",
                "We must also explain clearly that we do not condone the present tendency of the Hungarian government to restore the king to the throne. The American-Hungarians are true to the ideals of the American Constitution and sympathize with a republican form of government. We would not make a move to help to the throne a degenerate member of the Hapsburg dynasty, or any other aspiring feudal lord.",
                "Our other stipulation is that we should not follow or foster such Hungarian politics here as would be objectionable and in direct conflict with American political interests.",
                "In Italian circles, a few fanatical leaders wanted to start a Fascist organization on the pattern of Mussolini's organization. The result was that the American press made public this un-American activity, which proved very embarrasing to Italian-Americans, and which was discussed even in Congress.....",
                "Before the Trianon treaty revision movement becomes more serious, it would be advisable to ask the proper United States authorities whether or not it is legal for American citizens to organize an active political party for the revision of the Trianon treaty here in America.",
                "If we do not ask this information now, then when the movement has gained momentum and will mean something to the Americans, others who oppose the revision will do it. It is not necessary to say that the enemies of the revision of the Trianon treaty are numerous and that they also have influential friends in the proper places.",

The only difference between the cross-bearers mentioned above is that the animal wears its cross without knowing about it. These faithful cross-bearers of Horthy will soon be hurrying back to Budapest for hand-kissing ceremonies; they will thank Horthy for the high honors accorded them [for their work in suppressing] any activities on the part of the Hungarian-Americans [in behalf of Karolyi].",

Every sober-minded person can see that these cross-bearers are people who sold themselves to Horthy, regardless of the fact that under his leadership, the crippled nation of Hungary will be led to ruin. All that these people are interested in is personal glory or important government positions. Some even dream of occupying a parliamentary seat.",
                "The Hungarian-Americans are acquainted with these marked gentlemen who propagandize against activities in behalf of Karolyi. These people received [awards of] distinction for their work, not because their activities were helping to ease the suffering of the Hungarian people. Horthy's American ambassador and consuls are just like the one we have in Chicago who is continually snooping around among the people, shaking hands and handing out compliments freely in order that he may take advantage of them and swing them away from the ideas of Karolyi.",
                "A large number of those who have received honors from Horthy are priests. This was done because the Hungarian-Americans are faithful church members. They believe that every word of the priest is sacred. [This is the first reason for Horthy's favoritism toward the priests.] Secondly the priests realize that if either Horthy or some one else should declare a republican state in Hungary, the vast properties of the Church would be confiscated, and the power of the priests over the people would be abolished. This is the reason for the priest's faithfulness to Horthy.",
                "The reformed ministers have come to a temporary agreement with Horthy. Naturally this agreement will be useful only if Horthy is successful. Everyone remembers that when Horthy took power in Hungary, Dr. Dezso Baltazar, bishop of the Reformed Church of Debreczen, Hungary, made some untimely speeches for which he almost paid with his life. His tour in this country at the present time is being made successful through the efforts of Horthy's henchmen. Even our Hungarian consul in Chicago has sponsored a luncheon in honor of the Bishop. This shows very clearly why the Hungarian reformed ministers of America are receiving the cross of distinction.",
                "We are anxiously waiting to see when the Jewish priests will receive their awards. It is true that a few of those who have received awards are Jewish, but this is only a camouflage. We believe that the Hungarian American Jews will disown all Jews who accept this type of distinction. Such an award will act as a tool to prevent the advancement of the Jewish people in Hungary and [to negate the worth of their achievement.] The Hungarian-American Jews won't forget that after the 1848 war for liberty in Hungary it was the Jews who helped put Hungary back on its feet. [After the World War they would have done it again in a few years.] But the Horthy machine of destruction used fire and steel to kill and drive the Jews out of Hungary in order that the properties of the wealthier Jews might be claimed by the government.",

We shall discuss only those who affect the lives of the Hungarian people in Chicago.",
                "First we must stop at the door of Father Stephen Soltesz, the priest at the Hungarian Roman Catholic Church on the South Side of Chicago. This gentleman is working hard to increase his own personal wealth, and cares little for any patriotic movements that might be going on around Chicago. This charge is proved by the fact that his church is ready to fall apart, although he has been making collections for a new one for a long time. The entire Hungarian population of Chicago is disgraced by the dilapidated condition of this Hungarian church. This priest feels fine when he can climb into the pulpit and warn his people against going to hear Karolyi, if Karolyi should come to Chicago. Therefore this man must be watched.",
                "The award given to Eugene Boros, minister of the South Side Reformed Church, is quite a surprise. This minister of the Hungarian Reformed Church of Chicago was present at a farewell banquet given in honor of Brentano at the Hungarian University Club. His speech was so radical that even the extreme radicals present protested. And last year at the flag dedication ceremonies of the Rakoczi Society where he was the honorary speaker, he declared Lenin and Trotzky, the founders of Red Russia, to be the two outstanding men of the day. So Horthy hung a medal of distinction on this man. But that is all right because Brother Boros will repay him when the time comes to talk about Karolyi, should Karolyi come to Chicago. Then the Chicago Hungarians should [mark the words] of this exponent of the \"red\" cause.",
                "That Louis Szappanos has received his award will not surprise anyone. Because this man has served two crosses for quite some time. Every Hungarian will remember that when John Hock was here, he asked the Hungarian Societies's Central Committee to request their membership to participate in a peoples meeting. Szappanos was the president of the organization at that time; he misrepresented the decision of the organization, and in an official letter insulted John Hock.",
                "Now we are waiting with great interest for the Chicago Hungarian Independent Song Society to sponsor a banquet in honor of the recognized gentleman, Louis Szappanos. But perhaps this organization has a large Jewish membership which will disown Szappanos and will draw the membership away from this Horthy cross-bearing soldier. His type of person only worms his way into Hungarian societies in order to gain an official position that he may obstruct any movement against the activities of Horthy. All those who received recognition or money from the Horthy government, should be repudiated by the Hungarian-Americans.",
                "Recently a noble example was set for us by a group of Hungarian businessmen from the South Side of Chicago who returned one of our daily papers that constantly insults Karolyi to the editors of the paper with a request that the subscription be suspended because they did not care to read such filthy material. Every Hungarian should do likewise, and from now on no one should contribute to any Horthy activities. There is at present an individual traveling around, visiting Hungarian communities and asking for contributions for a Horthy orphanage. However these contributions will be used to subsidize government affairs. Naturally this agent who is making these collections receives a large salary from the Hungarian Ambassador in Washington. The liberal Hungarians have donated thousands of dollars already. All Hungarians should think twice before they sign any sort of pledge or contribution, because there has been more than enough of these swindles. The Horthy cross-bearing warriors are multiplying like flies in the spring.",

                "We must remember that in 1914, at the beginning of the World War, we knew that we would create many enemies by saying that the War would be disastrous to Hungary because regardless of who won, Hungary would lose. We admit that many times we in America wished that our prophesies might be wrong, because we still possess the Hungarian spirit. It is sad but our prophesy came true.",
                "Now we must speak and answer the question, will there be a new Hungary? The answer is distressing; there will not be a new Hungary. The only possible way that a new Hungary could be born would be for her to completely wipe out the present form of government and replace it with one that is totally democratic and guarantees the liberty of all citizens.",
                "The most unfortunate fact is that in those territories which have been taken from Hungary, the school teachers and other public officials fled and deserted the Hungarian people who live there. If these people had remained and maintained their integrity as well as that of the rest of the people, the time would have come when the people could have freed themselves.",
                "We read that the Turks set on the necks of the Hungarian people for one hundred and fifty years. This is historical truth. But the Turks did not try to make a Mohamedan territory out of Hungary. The Turks were not interestedF in the people--they wanted the taxes. The Turks realized that this situation would end someday, and when that day came, they would have to get out of Hungary. The day came, and they left--fully satisfied that Allah wanted it that way.",
                "Today most of the nations  have taken  of unHungary do not accept Turkish fatalism. The Slavish-speaking people especially are very impressive. They know that the strength of the people lies in education, therefore they are not stressing the building of churches. They say that the only time they need a priest is when they die.",
                "Can you or anyone else believe that those Hungarians in the ceded territories",
                "If the Hungarian government wants to retain the respect of the Hungarians scattered throughout the world she must render services that are far superior to those of these foreign governments. If the Hungarian-Americans expect aid from the American people, it will be up to us to see that those who are in Hungary receive bread, land and civil rights. This must be done with due legality using the Bethlen-Horthy procedure.",
                "Further the Hungarian-American press must cease its espionage tactics. When these things are done we can discuss problems of integrity.",
                "But to ask Hungarian-Americans to shoulder the burden of the abuses of the Bethlen-Horthy government is out of the question.",
                "Therefore we Hungarian-Americans are still wondering whether there will be a new Hungary."

The Hungarian-American people are rather tired of donating funds for different purposes in Hungary. The reasons for this is, that most of the Hungarian-American people are continually pestered by friends and relatives asking for help in one form or another; another, is that the economic conditions have gotten so bad that many have asked for aid from their fellow Hungarians, here in Chicago, and other are just making both ends meet; so from these people, one cannot expect any help.",
                "Just as we stated above Bishop Baltazar, is sincere in his brave liberalism, and should be respected for his work in connection with his tireless efforts to see that the cultural work of the Seminary of Debreczen be continued, and therefore, is deserving of the support of the Hungarians both financially and spiritually.",

When Count Karolyi was exiled to the island Lacron, his wife and children gave up all the luxuries that might have been theirs for the asking through her father Baron Andrassy.

It has happened more than once that innocent patriots gave their lives in order to overthrow the detrimental government. After the defeat during the war for liberty, the more noble ones of us were banished shamefully, and yet the generation which has come up since 1848, has been taught hate against Italy whereas hate towards the Hapsburgs should have been taught.",

America's share of this loan consists of seven and a half million dollars. In London, they have released close to thirty-three million dollars. The additional ten million dollars will be floated in Holland, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland Czechoslovakia, and Hungary.",
                "The biggest share of this loan was taken up by the Baring Brothers, the world's largest bankers of the house of Rothchild, and Schroder and company. This factor assures the Hungarian government that the loan will be placed. The American portion of the loan was taken up by one of the leading banks of the country, Speyer and Co., who with the co-operation of several other banks floated the issue on the American money markets.",
                "The loan that is being floated in this country will yield approximately nine per cent. The Hungarian government will start buying these bonds back on the market after February 2, 1925. The price of these bonds is eighty-seven dollars and will be bought back for not more than one hundred dollars.",
                "With reference to the security of this loan, Jeremiah Smith, of the League of Nations, and Baron Frigyes Koranyi, Minister of Finance in Hungary have made the following decision: Through this loan the value of the Hungarian money will be stabilized and the Hungarian money will be stabilized and the Hungarian budget will be regulated accordingly through taxation.",
                "Jeremiah Smith has been designated by the League of Nations to see that this idea is carried out, thereby insuring the loan. He will regulate the disbursement of this loan, which will be used for reconstruction purposes and other necessary governmental expenses.",
                "The loan will be insured through the taxation of sugar, tobacco and salt. The revenue derived from this taxation was 6 million 200 thousand dollars for the first four months of 1924, which is two and one-half times as much as is required to pay off part of the principal and the interest on the loan.",
                "To insure the collection of these taxes, there will be a separate department set up to handle the funds. At the end of each month, this department will give one-twelfth of the monthly receipts to a specially appointed committee from the League of Nations to do with this money as they see fit.",
                "The League of Nations reserves the right to keep in close touch with the financial conditions of Hungary until such a time when this loan is paid back and the financial set-up in Hungary is sound.",
                "On March the 14th, 1924, England, France, Italy, Rumania, Jugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia, declared to accept Hungary's political and economic set-up, thereby assuring those who had bought Hungarian bonds that it was a safe investment.",
                "During the last few weeks we have received many inquiries in regard to this loan, asking us for our opinions. Many cane to us and asked whether or not we recommend the purchase of these bonds.",
                "When we render opinions we do not dodge any of the issues in regard to the question. We are sure that our readers who have been following us for many years will vouch for this statement.",

                "If the settlement of this question depended on us, we would have agreed that this loan was necessary, because we would have been satisfied with the facts.",
                "Now then, here is where our opinions differ. We would never give the Horthy and Bethlen government a cent, and we would demand that this entirely crooked government be stopped. Anyone connected with Horthy and Bethlen should be removed from all county and city offices, so that the government can be handed back directly to the people, so that through the voting powers of the people a suitable government can be elected.",
                "We do not doubt that even if there was a democratic form of government in Hungary that this loan would have been made. We believe that if they had taxed the large land-owners, bankers, and financiers, it would have been able to float this loan right in the country itself, but it seems that this was not necessary, because the world bankers took care of this situation. Now we must discuss this new fact also.",
                "This loan does not mean anything, as far as patriotism is concerned, among the Hungarian people of America. Therefore, it is not necessary to make a patriotic appeal. This loan means only a good or bad business proposition as far as the public itself is concerned. The public either forms its own opinion, or goes to his or her banker for advice to see whether a bond issue such as this is a good business risk or not.",
                "Nine per cent interest on an investment is very inviting for those who leap at a chance to reap large profits from their investments will buy some of these bonds; but those who are satisfied with a smaller profit, with not as great a risk, will stay away from this loan.",
                "Without any question, Hungary will be able to pay the interest on this loan and eventually repay the loan itself, providing the situation in Hungary and in Central Europe remains peaceful and quiet. But who will guarantee that for the next twenty years, peace will reign in Central Europe and in the Balkans? The least bit of unrest will render great damage to these documents of value.",
                "Military activities would crumble all expectations, and the most binding contracts. Therefore the repayment of this loan does not depend on the taxation of sugar, tobacco and salt, but it does depend on peace in Central Europe. From this point of view, we think that all those people who are thinking of investing hard earned money in foreign bonds would examine the question.",
                "Horthy and Bethlen may be rooted firmly, but the unrest of the Italians, and Rumanians might crumble their entire power, putting entire Europe in military furor.",
                "This is only one example of many, because most anything might happen among the restless nations and politicians of Europe.",
                "This fifty million-dollar loan will be received by Hungary whether the Hungarian people subscribe to it or not.",
                "When the world-famous bankers signed their names to this loan it became a reality, because when they endorse a bond issue, even if it were for five hundred million dollars, it would be good. So no one need get a head-ache wondering whether the Hungarian government will get this loan or not. We will come right out and declare ourselves, that according to our opinion, this form of government, whose present and past is bloody and sinful, has no future, and is not deserving of this loan to insure its continuation.",
                "To those people who pay little or no attention to the above notations, and at the same time do not recall the sad fate of the Hungarian Government's war loan, we wish a lot of luck in this business venture when he or she gives their hard earned dollar to the banker who has promised such great profits in return. We are of the opinion that our good wishes will be appreciated sooner or later."

This sort of action does not alleviate the situation of our homeland; it only causes more hardships for our people. It takes the bread away from our starving brothers in Hungary! In both cases, the tourists were Americans, and the pessimists were Hungarians. The advice was given by people who were either misinformed or were lacking in loyalty to our homeland. We can dispense with the latter in short order, for they do not belong among us; but those who were misinformed we will willingly enlighten, for the dissolution of darkness is one of our great tasks.",
                "It is true that starvation and misery prevail in Hungary, and that many people are in rags. But why? Is it because, perhaps, there are no clothes, shoes, or underwear available? Are they starving because there are no potatoes, meat, or wheat available? Of course not! Hungary has everything available. What the people do not have is the money to purchase these necessities of life, and the work by which to earn the necessary money.",
                "A decent and healthy balance does not exist between the earning power and the cost of the necessities of life. In order for a worker to live decently, he must earn a thousand korona a day. The average worker does not receive half of this amount for his work. The office workers do not receive one-fourth of this amount for his work. That is why so much misery and hunger prevail in our homeland. The aristocrats, high priests, jewelers, bankers, and politicians are not starving and are not in misery. If you have money, you can obtain everything in Hungary.",
                "The purchasing power of the korona is much higher to-day in Hungary than elsewhere, for the value of the korona is standardized there. Thus, when an American tourist arrives in Budapest or anywhere else in Hungary with a well-filled pocketbook, he does not have to fear that he will starve or that he is eating food which should go to the starving people.",
                "Anyone who has read the recent issues of newspapers from the homeland has seen the articles pertaining to the beautiful and extensive displays at the various food markets; if there is very little activity there, it is because this food is beyond the reach of the average worker. How can a poor factory worker or office worker with a family purchase pork if a killo (21/4 lbs.) costs 140 to 150 korona? For an American tourist the price is very cheap; the price of two and one-fourth pounds of pork chops would be 28 cents in American money. The price of five korona for one egg is prohibitive to the residents of Budapest, but to the American it amounts to only one cent. Of course, if the visitor was to earn his livelihood in Hungary, then he too would be opposed to the prices of foodstuffs on the markets of Hungary. But by exchanging the money he earned in America for Hungarian korona, and making his purchases with the korona, the American will find that it is very much cheaper to live in Hungary than anywhere else.",
                "Now then, it would be very fortunate for our homeland, if by some means there would come to Hungary more foreign tourists with foreign money to spend. If this should happen to our homeland, then the tremendous worry and burden would be eased from the heart of our finance minister, Heqedus. This would save the nearly worthless korona. It would soften the heavy problems of imports and exports. The greatest piece of luck that could strike our homeland at this time would be for five thousand foreign tourists to arrive in Hungary this summer, with each one spending an average of a thousand dollars.",
                "The circulation of five million dollars of foreign money in Hungary would promote agricultural growth, enable the government to stabilize the value of the korona at a higher rate and settle the problem of duties on exports and imports, and enable many thousands of unemployed to return to work immediately.",
                "The banks in Hungary are today building cold storage plants, in which to store surplus food products. It is very costly and troublesome to ship to foreign ports, and, because our foreign neighbors are striking against the high cost of living, we find that the surplus food either becomes spoiled or finds its way into the cold storage plants.",
                "The American movement to save the Hungarian children from starvation is not made necessary by the lack of bread and rice in Hungary. Hungary is requesting aid from America for the starving children only, because these children have no one who can afford to purchase food for them--there is no work or money. Those who have a little money find that the money they do have has no purchasing power.",
                "We see advertised in the newspapers of Budapest the fact that the cost of a dinner or supper, consisting of four or five eggs as the entree, and including musical entertainment, is thirty cents of American money. This would be an ideal way for the American to enjoy his meals, with a real Gypsy orchestra, and a few drinks of that delicious Hungarian champagne--all for thirty cents.",
                "For a Hungarian worker the cost is prohibitive, especially if he is a family man. If the Hungarian worker attempts to live on this scale for a time, where will he get the extra money to pay rent, light, hundreds of different taxes, carfare, etc.?",
                "Hungary does not suffer from a shortage of food! Only those who are mistaken or who desire to do harm to our homeland would say so. The trouble originated in the printing of worthless money by our homeland's government. In addition, irresponsible leaders and an unsound form of government have brought about the loss of the export trade. Hungary has no commerce, no coal, no railroads, no steamships. Without coal or transportation, commerce and industry cannot exist. Therefore, since commerce and industry do not exist, we have no work and no income, and when we have no income we have no bread. Thus we find, in our homeland, misery, sacrifice, despair, hatred, murder, robbery epidemics, and suicides.",
                "We feel very much disheartened that epidemics of disease and suicides are prevailing in our homeland. If we continue to chase away the foreign tourists and visitors from our homeland, we are by these actions sanctioning the increase of terror, misery, starvation and suicides in Hungary."

Accusations have been hurled at Von Horthy to incite him to argue over the matter. I personally do not know Von Horthy, except by his pictures in the newspapers. Looking at his picture with that scornful grin, one could sign his death warrant without flinching.",
                "In Von Horthy's writings his soul is revealed, and if we examine his soul, we must admit that he is right, though slow to act. So let us wait awhile before making any drastic move.",
                "I ask the editor of the Magyar Tribune why he would like to have Von Horthy and men like him lined up in the front rank on the battlefield. Perhaps not because of the protest meetings organized against the monarchy, where the Hungarians wave their flag again. Or perhaps he would have them arrange a demonstration against the restoration of the monarchy and deliver speeches. Or maybe they are leading the Hungarians forth on a Crusade against the new president. Von Horthy is justified in saying that those compatriots of ours who have with difficulty struggled across the stream, are most probably earning their livelihood in Hungary and should not gamble with their security and give up their means of subsistence until the time for action does arrive.",
                "I do not want any one to think that I am stating that we should forget our native land, which is rent to pieces, and let the good Lord take care of it, satisfied with whatever the good Lord may decree.",
                "These articles express diverse views, and everybody should express his opinion openly here where we have freedom of speech. We should not begin to help our native land in such a way as to harm ourselves as well as Hungary. We must first digest the best and the most advanced ideas and then begin our work.",
                "Let us first seek and find the causes why Hungary is laboring in the struggle to restore the monarchy. We see that the newspapers here also publish powerful propaganda in the Hungarian struggle for the restoration of the old adorable apostolic system.",
                "Hungary has been ruled from time immemorial by the aristocracy and the hierarchy, whose leader was the king. As a result of the disruption of the country after the World War the people were deprived of their means of making a livelihood, and this caused the ruin of the aristocrats. The hierarchy is aware that if in the mutilated country's territory a democratic form of government should spring into existence, then the power which they have heretofore enjoyed would vanish.",
                "The hierarchy called upon the aristocratic rulers, who were able to command the confidence of the people, to strive to restore the monarchy as soon as possible. This would also have restored their ancient environment of luxury for the aristocrats. The Hungarians of America have for many years helped our native land with the dollars that we have saved, and if we continue this help and in addition send a supply of vigorous and powerful workers there, then the material disturbances will cease. The people, tormented to death after the war, do not much care whether they have a democratic form of government or the monarchy restored. All they want is that peace and prosperity shall reign, so that they may have the means of gaining a livelihood, for starvation, misery, and poverty have no time for patriotism, [which will be revived] when the people are well fed and materially satisfied. As the Hungarian says, \"the rest we will take care of later\".",
                "In reading newspapers and letters from Hungary we find that they assert that King Charles is still the ruler over the country, and that he did not abdicate his throne, but merely retired until law and order should be restored.",
                "In one of his letters Count Apponyi states that in the course of his travels through Switzerland he felt it his personal duty to locate and do homage to the nation's anointed king. All these letters are written to the Hungarians in America for the purpose of misleading us.",
                "If the king could be quickly and successfully restored to his throne, then the ruined upper class, the so-called aristocrats by birth, would recover their positions in the governmental offices, under the shadow of the king's throne. However, unless the king is restored, these aristocrats and the upper class in general will be forced to earn their livelihood by doing honest work, a thing which they utterly despise. The hierarchy will lose its tremendous entailed estates and its other possessions. Their destiny would be similar to that of France after the collapse of the royal government. The bloodthirsty struggle which is now taking place in Hungary is due to the attempt to restore the king to the throne. They should follow the example of Germany, which also suffered the disruption of its territory after the World War. The entire world gazes with admiration at Germany, which is slowly regaining its self-respect because its leaders have strictly confined themselves to the development of commerce and industry.",
                "Should our homeland's national government hold a parliamentary meeting and decide, by vote of the people's chosen representatives, that the first step in settling the affairs of Hungary is to restore the king to the throne, then the protests that we Hungarians in America make would be in vain. The result would be identical with that experienced when we protested in Washington against the continuance of the World War, just before the armistice was declared, in order to save our unfortunate country. Our people and our country were treated like Jesus, who although innocent was nailed upon the cross.",
                "I wish to bring the attention of the Hungarians in Chicago to the terrible situation as outlined in my article, and I want every thinking Hungarian in Chicago to express his opinion, so that we may know what to do.",
                "According to my notion the Hungarians in America should not listen to their high-toned compatriots but [instead] should save up their money so that they will have the necessary means with which to help when the time comes to do so.",
                "In the meantime I advise those Hungarians who are returning to Hungary and those who are corresponding with that country to urge our kinsmen not to choose representatives to the parliament who are of the aristocratic class.",
                "We want them to choose those upright compatriots who wholeheartedly seek the welfare of the people and do not wear their hearts on their chins. Then perhaps those poor tortured people will not have to sweat their millions to maintain the king's gardens, the tremendous list of unnecessary offices for the aristocrats, and the king's bodyguard. Instead, they will be able to restore their mutilated country and to develop themselves agriculturally, industrially, and commercially. In recognition of this the entire world will accord to our country the respect which is due to it and will give substantial aid to it instead of leaving it as now, to struggle alone."

                "A declaration was made by Baron Sterenyi, Ex-Minister of Commerce, which is of much interest to American-Magyars. Furthermore, this declaration proves that the Magyar Tribune was right when it warned the American-Magyars to be careful when they read the \"sweet\" messages and promises of the great lords sent over from Hungary. We advise you not to act as \"scapegoats,\" believing there is any sincerity in anything the great lords promise. Baron Sterenyi's declaration reads as follows: \"I would loan my money to the State of Hungary. Our American brothers could save the Fatherland if they would put their savings at the disposal of the State of Hungary. The emigrated Magyars, who were persecuted while residing in Hungary, and in whom no one showed a desire to aid, could restore the country. The dollar now has such a high market value that a few million dollars would assist us greatly, also a few years of good crops would aid this country to revive itself. But it has to be made possible for us to carry on through these few years. I venture to say that our fate rests in the hands of the American-Magyars. If I were the head of the Government, I would ask Count Apponyi to go to America to accomplish this aim. I imagine that much money has accumulated in America during the war when no money could have been sent to Hungary. If our kin would give only a part of that money, the work and the grain production could begin at home. The American-Magyars on the other hand could engage in a good business and they would make a good investment with their money, they would risk nothing. It is their duty to aid their native country and their kin left at home, even if it would call for some risk. But if this work can be done without any hazard, I think they should consider it their sacred duty.\"",
                "It is real Solomonic advice, is it not? We know that we could save our native country with our savings, and we always have been willing to do so, but if we are forced to donate this money to the great lords for the restoration of the old system, it would be discouraging. We will not do it. We regret that Mr. Sterenyi, a man of such high intelligence, would even suggest this plan.",
                "However, we appreciate the fact that you admit the attitude of the great lords towards American-Magyars, that the American-Magyars were always despised by the great lords of Hungary, and still you wish to send Count Apponyi to this country to aid you in this work. We know that the great lords would like to get our money, it would enable them to continue to persecute us in the future. American-Magyars, however, will not give them strength for that.",
                "At this time we give a brief answer to Mr. Von Lorthy's last week's newspaper article.",
                "Mr. Von Lorthy should be able to see that it is dangerous to wait any longer and thereby permit great lords to use every means to deprive the American-Magyars of their hard earned savings. There will be no need of any misunderstanding between us if your policy is the same as it was in the past. If you start the work on this same plan with our support, nobody will be strong enough to hinder us in this work, because if we begin to give our protests to such treatment, that will bring some real results. Then, there will be no use for the lamp post. We want to earn the esteem of our suffering mother country and the love of her tormented people. Therefore, let us act, Mr. Von Lorthy. This is no time for shyness."

                "Quite a few of our readers want to know where we get the idea that American public opinion ridicules the King's restoration plans of Hungary, asking whether there is any truth in the reports that Hungary is planning to restore the monarchy.",

                "Besides, to prove that we are right, let us quote a cable from Hungary, published in the Chicago Tribune. It says: \"Admiral Horthy, the governor, adjourned the National Assembly for an indefinite time on account of the continual quarrels over the question of restoration of the Hapsburg Dynasty. All political factions agree that the question of the throne of Hungary is entirely a home affair. Naturally if it is impossible to come to a decision on this question, Governor Horthy will have to turn to the people of the country, dissolving the National Assembly and ordering new elections.\"",

It seems this is their only task; or perhaps they don't know anything else, for when the National Assembly make a law, it is useless or at best an echo of the rack and stick punishment of the Middle Ages. Hence, it is much better that instead of making laws, the legislators play, debate and make long orations over insignificant matters.",
                "Looking back at the old pre-war days we can see that the members of the Hungarian Parliament are very fond of arguing and fighting over nothing, it was just their \"hobby.\"",
                "Everybody remembers the big commotion in the political circles of Hungary when Franz Ferdinand was proclaimed Crown Prince. For months after the event, the subject of the disputes was who would be the crown prince of Hungary after Franz Ferdinand's death. When he married the Bohemian Countess, they wasted still more time in debates as to whether or not the children from this morganatic marriage would have a right to the Hungarian throne, according to the law, of the Hapsburg House.",
                "Our best lawyers, such as Desider Szilagyi, Geza Polonyi, Soma Visontay, and a few others wrote whole essays on the matter and made long orations in Parliament to discuss the right of succession. What did the Magyar people gain by that? Nothing! A fanatic Serbian student solved the problem of succession with a bullet. Or when the members of Parliament wasted their time with the so-called Austro-Hungarian common law disputes, the Army's commanding language and the bill of the sword knot. Bills about flags and many other trifles of the common army caused long disputes. It can be said that the ten years prior to the War the Hungarian Parliament wasted most of their time in useless and worthless disputes. It is now that we know that the victories on the Russian and Italian battlefields were not brought about by the sword knot or by the flag. It would have been better if the legislators had occupied their minds with the problems of provisions, clothing, and sanitation of the army.",
                "The National Assembly worries about a matter which is the least harmful, but it cannot see the long oppressive fog which weighs heavily on the poor Hungarian people.",
                "The Hungarian king question will be solved soon, not only by the Hungarians, but by the Allies and other small hostile countries encircling Hungary, which also claim the right of decision.",
                "The Hungarian National Assembly should direct their attention to more useful and serious things, such as winning sympathy for the Hungarian cause in foreign countries so that the poor Hungarian people may get rid of their worries and headaches. Because of all this waste of time by the National Assembly, the poor Hungarian people have to pay and suffer at the end."

What do you say to that? Will it be all right? I have to say the same thing the Tribune said. I was surprised by the sudden change in your friendly opinion regarding the Tribune or its editor in chief, who knows me well since I came to this country. He thinks that I deserve to be hoisted up on a lamp post for the simple reason that I advise my \"deserting\" fellow-patriots not to hurry things up but wait until developments show them what is best for our native country and for the common welfare of Hungary. Furthermore, the Tribune considers it a crime that I did not read a December issue of the Pesti Hirlap and that I missed the great lords' messages sent over to dupe us, as you expressed it yourself. No, I didn't read that the new Finance Minister is planning to cut out an enormous lump of flesh from the body of the country. Nor did I read that you complain that the new Minister appropriated the contribution that we sent to our relatives and friends.",

Had I read all these things, would I have asked the Tribune what was to be gained by the people of Hungary or the Hungarian people in this country? Could I have prevented all this, if I had learned all about it way ahead before it happened?",
                "I wonder at the twisted conclusion of the Tribune in condemning me for something I haven't done. I have never changed my political views or will change them in the future. However, I must declare openly, although I am sorry to do so, that I will not be lured by the Tribune to participate in any political adventure injurious to our native country, which went through so many changes lately. It is better to take it easy. It hardly need be said that we do not trust the political leaders of pre-war times; some of them gave us reason enough for distrust. On the other hand, there are others among the old-time political leaders who, through their knowledge and experience, could be very useful in the task of re-building Hungary. If they have some old-time political sins, let these sins be forgiven.",

As a banker, Hegedus has no time to serve the old political system; just because he began his political career with a \"little bleeding\" of the country, we don't have to club him instantly. If he ordered that twenty cents are to be deducted from every crown of our charity money, there is still some money left for the poor.",
                "Let's give him time and see how he will progress. Perhaps he will be the first to understand that it is impossible to make anything fast with worn out screws. Probably he will give up the idea of cutting out flesh when he realizes that there are only bones left. Those newspaper articles of the \"great lords\" don't have to be taken with such an anger either.",

By doing so they admit their own helplessness. There is Count Apponyi, the great statesman, who never in his life wanted to harm his country. He can be of great use to our native country with his knowledge. We don't have to hurt his feelings. Therefore, we don't have to send everybody to the lamp post before his time.",

I wonder whether the Tribune ever examines the letters that come from Hungary. If it does it must have noticed that the stamps on the envelopes read in large letters, \"Help Hungary.\" This shows what has become of the once noble and proud nation. When we read these words, our eyes fill with tears. Although now we can do nothing, the time will come when we will prove to the world that our kin don't have to resort to begging, not even on their postal stamps. The Tribune still wants to send everybody to the lamp post; even those who are able or eager to help their native country.",

                "There you can read about the new order of the Finance Minister: Every bank deposit was attached and twenty crowns were appropriated from every 100 crowns by the government.",
                "It seems, Mr. Von Lorthy, you have no time to find out that letters are coming by the thousands, from the suffering Old Country, asking contributions, and that every American Magyar is constantly sending financial aid. You don't seem to know that the American Magyar banks are daily publishing large advertisements exhorting the Magyars of this country to aid the people in the Old Country.",
                "We American Magyars sent enough money to our relatives in the Old Country to make their Christmas more pleasant. However, instead of helping our people we unwillingly helped the great lords, and we made a nice Christmas for them. They put their hands on the money when nobody expected it. The contributions which we sent for charitable purposes were taxed 20 Hellers on every Crown. What do you say to that, Mr. Von Lorthy?",
                "Shall we still wait with the belief that, \"everything will be all right?\"",
                "Did you read the message sent by Lorant Hegedus, Finance Minister, to us \"deserters and traitors.\" Apparently you did not. He tells us that he will let us, American Magyars, make our beloved people,of the Fatherland, happy; he will let us do that \"small part,\" because our money is needed there. (But Hegedus would make only his own clique, the great lords,happy; our common people could perish). They know in the Old Country that they need our help now and they try to win us by flattery.",
                "Minister Huszar tried flattery too. We have to be satisfied, however, with the result or rather with the lack of results which Mr. Huszar obtained while touring in America. If we will always be careful and refuse to be fooled by the nice promises of the ministers, we will avoid the cut just as we did when Huszar was here.",
                "We are taking the liberty to tell you, sincerely, that although we still admire your past policy, we would like to see you show your true colors; tell us if you want to lead us with your experience and knowledge or are you siding with the revivers of the old system. In the latter case you would earn the contempt of the \"deserters and traitors,\" and you would also deserve the lamp-post. Your proper place would be not among us, the \"traitors and deserters,\" but among those \"great patriots,\" the great lords.",
                "Dear Mr. Lorthy, your newspaper article is an unpleasant surprise. We believed that you, as a real working man,-who without any aid or influence obtained your position-would be our leader in this big extraordinary problem, the restoration of Hungary. We cannot stand idle and see our dear native country dying away without our aid, for which idleness we would deserve a rightful reproach. On the other hand, we might get an unreliable leader, who might deceitfully spend our contributions towards reviving the old system. Then our great sacrifices would be in vain, without any benefit to our native country.",
                "We hope that the great lords will see and resign themselves to the fact that we do not pay any attention to their talk or to their newspaper articles. We know that the great lords want to be present during our saving and restoration activities so they could boast in the future that they have restored order and thus get an opportunity to bleed the people again.",
                "In the December 21, 1920 issue of Pesti Hirlap, under the heading: \"The Magyars of Foreign Countries for Hungary,\" the great lords affirm our statement that only we, the American Magyars can put Hungary on her feet. The great lords call everybody who is unwilling to contribute to the cause \"traitors and deserters.\" That means they expect us \"deserters\" to give our money for strengthening the old system.",
                "Now we can ask: who are the real traitors? Are not the real traitors of the country those who, knowing that the people lost confidence in them, still would not go away from the \"larder?\" Since the great lords admit that only we can restore the country, and that we do not trust them to handle our money, then why don't they clear away and let us \"deserters\" help our beloved native country to flourish and our kin folk, the working people, happy?",
                "You, Mr. Von Lorthy, not only want to keep away from the great work yourself out you are bold enough to warn everybody else: \"let us wait.\" For what and for whom shall we wait? What can we expect if we simply look quietly at the games of the great lords? It is a mortal sin to wait any longer and do nothing.",
                "We believe that it should not be necessary to implore you, Mr. Von Lorthy. Get into action as soon as possible. It is your duty to offer your services to the country. We can demand it because the existence of the whole country is at stake and not the existence of an individual.",
                "Mr. Lorthy, come out of the cave of idleness, and let us get busy before it is too late. Then we can say to you: \"Everything will be all right and blissful.\" We do not have to wait and see because we know what will happen. So, Mr. Von Lorthy, let us become active and at the same time you can prove that your political platform is unchanged."

                "Out of the terrible chaos into which the Magyar nation fell at the end of the World War a weak sound of awakening is audible.",
                "The nation's financial collapse was caused by the general lack of confidence in Hungarian money. Neither foreign countries nor the Hungarian people believed that the Hungarian crown had any real value.",
                "For a long time the problem of this desperate economic situation could not be solved. At last Lorant Hegedus was appointed finance minister; he is a representative of the liberal faction. The Horthy government expected of Hegedus the solution of the economic crisis. Hegedus had to resort to radical methods to save the Hungarian economic situation from total collapse.",
                "At present the whole European money valuation is in the hands of stock exchange speculators, and so it is impossible to foresee the effect on the Hungarian crown of Hegedus's energetic maneuvers. It is most important to establish credit and confidence by public economy in Hungary, and we think that this result will be obtained by the expert methods of the new finance minister.",
                "As Hegedus expresses it, he is counting on American Magyars to aid him in his work. We do not know his intentions in detail, but we can guess what they may be. It does not matter what conditions are in this country. Whether we are working or not, whether we have coal and a winter coat or not, everybody envies us in Hungary because we live in the country of dollars,--and in Hungary today the dollar is the symbol of abundance, prosperity, and wealth. Everybody in Hungary dreams of the dollar.",
                "The people of Hungary think that it is quite natural that every one of us should have a bank account and a steady well-paying job or business.",
                "Therefore everybody turns to the United States and writes here for help. They consider it quite easy for an American to make a twenty-dollar contribution to a stranger when they air their complaints about the miserable condition and the small pay of Hungarian state officials.",
                "In Hungary twenty dollars is ten thousand crowns, and for that they can buy shoes, a little lard and flour, and a few pounds of sugar. They do not realize that here many American Magyars toil for a whole week for twenty dollars, and that a whole family can live for a week on twenty dollars in this country too; American families can even buy shoes of cheap quality on twenty dollars a week. Not only do simple-minded Hungarians misunderstand our situation, but the more intelligent people, such as merchants, have distorted ideas about us. We might expect the merchants who want to do business with us to have more sense.",
                "Let us take as an example the circular sent to the United States by a well-known music publisher of Hungary. The prices in the catalogue are quoted in dollars and cents for the convenience of American Magyars. One section of the circular reads:",
                "\"The purpose of every Magyar is to raise the low rate of exchange of Hungarian money, and we can accomplish this only by establishing the prices of our products in foreign money values. The greater the value in foreign money which comes to our country, the sooner will our public economic condition become strong, and the former value of Hungarian money be restored in foreign countries.",
                "\"Every cent which comes to Hungary is a new source of energy; every cent brings us nearer to the occupied territories unjustly taken away from us and our brethren [in these territories]. You will make a patriotic sacrifice if you order even the smallest article because you will contribute a brick to the rebuilding of our ruined public economy. Of these small bricks which our brethren [in America] contribute will be built up the new, strong, united, working Hungary.\"",
                "It sounds well in the circular, but when we looked over the catalogue, we found that the price of the simplest song or dance was seventy-five cents. Now aside from the fact that seventy-five cents is worth from three hundred to four hundred crowns, ten times the Budapest price [of these pieces of music], the price is ridiculous from a business viewpoint because here we can buy any piece of music for ten cents in the Woolworth stores.",
                "And so, no matter how warm the interest may be which our patriotic hearts feel for the rate of exchange of Hungarian money and for the economic condition of Hungary, we do not wish to be taken for numbskulls and simpletons, though we should be willing to pay for the postage and the wrapping. A [price list] like this may produce a smile of amusement or a frown of anger, but it will never bring business.",
                "Here is another good example: A Hungarian weekly magazine wanted to get subscribers among American Magyars. The yearly subscription was 580 [sic] crowns in Hungary. The postage on the magazines would be 24 crowns per year, and so if they had offered a year's subscription for 504 crowns in the United States, they might have gained quite a few subscribers here, since 504 crowns are equivalent to one American dollar. In accordance with Hungarian business reasoning, however, the subscription price was made ten dollars to American Magyars, exactly ten times the subscription rate in Hungary. We doubt whether a single American Magyar can be found who is willing to pay ten dollars a year for a magazine. They cannot see clearly over there in Hungary. It would be well for Minister Hegedus to come here and make an extensive examination of us in America, so that he could give some enlightenment to the business world of Hungary. The finance minister would be convinced that our hearts are filled with warm sentiment for our native land, and that we are willing to do many things for Hungary; but we cannot endure being exploited and treated as simpletons.",
                "We will either give of our own free will without demanding compensation, or we will buy things on an honest business basis."

The poor workingmen gave everything, and they will continue to give, until they collapse under the heavy burden; they will not cry for mercy, only we will weep for them, but on the other hand, we are glad that we have escaped the claws of the \"Great Lords.\"",

We have had no opportunity to meet you at banquets or pilgrimages, because you are viewing the events from your seclusion. We are not satisfied with that. You must come out and help us prove that we are Magyars who did not grow fat on the skin of the emigrant Magyars, but that we are successful because we have worked hard. And let us prove that we are able to solve the present problems ourselves, without the oppression of the Old Country, without \"Great Lords,\" and without their flattering, devilish newspaper articles, because they can only bring ruin.",

In Cleveland we have erected a memorial to Kossuth; in Budapest we have set up a memorial to Washington. We brought the Hungarian national flag to this country with elaborate ceremonies. Other events of similar nature have been celebrated.",

We do not complain about this, for we in America have lost nothing thereby. Since the World War has so mercilessly wrought its effects on Hungary, the relations between the Hungarians here in America and the homeland have been completely altered.",

We have become their American uncles, of whom their poverty-stricken populace dreams,--from whom they hope to inherit, to their great felicity, our fortunes of millions of dollars.",
                "To boast or to condemn is not the part of prudence. We do not boast, nor do we condemn because when our native land was afflicted with poverty, we Hungarians in America bore the burden with gallantry and with open hands, forgetting that Hungary had opposed us and neglected us because of the beliefs acquired by us in America regarding race and creed.",

And what is more, we affirm without boasting that we have persuaded the Hungarians of Chicago to create an organization for the purpose of receiving funds and seeing to it that the funds are properly forwarded to Hungary. We also urged our people here to donate to the best of their ability. So now we feel that we have the right to assert ourselves.",
                "Those of you who have read the recent issues of newspapers received from Hungary must have felt the blood rush to your heads. We read that the situation in Budapest, relative to the security of the Hungarians, is much worse than at the time of Rosza Sandor's and Sobri Joska's ruffianism. It has been much safer to walk through the thickest woods of Bakony's than down the main street [of Budapest].",

These self-styled moral uplifters are young hoodlums and ruffians who are fishing in troubled waters, while they continue to allow such men as Zakany Gyula, Daner Bela, and Ereky Karoly to dominate national affairs, such insecurity will prevail, and the result will be the overthrow of the government. They see that the Horthy government is passively carrying on. These Reds and profit-seeking hoodlums will soon find themselves before the bar of justice.",
                "From anarchy they derive their inspiration, their moral courage to take the law into their own hands, and their assumption of the right to requisition benzine, rooms, automobiles, and everything else which they may need for the use of the ruffians and the hoodlums. And their form of requisitioning is nothing more than thievery. In the old days of ruffianism in Hungary the method employed was highway robbery.",
                "This condition in Hungary must be stopped. It must be stopped as quickly as possible, before the country is completely wrecked. It is useless for any one in the homeland to speak out against this situation. It is useless for the press to protest. The government will be the same, in effect, if Teleky and his associates finally go, for then some other individuals with the same principles will take their places.",
                "Our opinion is that the Hungarians in America today have acquired rights in our homeland. In fact, it is to our interest here in America to prevent spreading over the cables the news of internal strife. Beginning with this, we must find a way to arouse public opinion in Hungary by sternly protesting from America. Our protest must insist on the establishment of law and order in Hungary.",
                "We do not want to interfere in the internal affairs of our native land, but today we have the right to force recognition of our voice, and for their own benefit they must accept our advice.

They must also show us that law and order have been established by dealing sternly with those bands of rowdies, who themselves do not spare anyone, and by bringing them speedily to justice. Just as we have protested to Hungary against its form of government, so now we protest against Hungary's becoming the nest of shame of Central Europe and the Balkans, the rendezvous of the underworld."

As humble tillers of the soil, it was in that land across the sea that we first saw the first life-giving rays of the sun. There it was that we first enjoyed the warmth of this beautiful sun until we grew up and found ourselves facing the terrible hardships of life. The large number of native-born Hungarians who live in this country is proof enough that the hardships of life in Hungary once clouded the sky of their future happiness.",
                "Here in the United States we simply told one another that we could not make a living in Hungary. We can, unhesitatingly, state that we very seldom ran across a Hungarian in this country who could brag that the people entrusted with the responsibilities of the Hungarian government ever told him to remain there or that they would see to it that laws would be enacted to insure him a comfortable living in return for his hard work. If they ever asked us to stay, it was at the point of a bayonet and because they realized that they needed us in order that they might continue to live a life of luxury. These conditions drove the Hungarians out, who were unable to settle until they reached the gates of American farms, mines, and industrial centers.",
                "We all left and no one seemed to care much about us. The same carelessness that has bred trouble in Hungary, has driven us out by the thousands in search of better living conditions. After the exodus it seemed, as if only the priests, ministers, and land barons remained in Hungary.",

Today in Hungary the government is oppressing and killing the wage earner. In the nation from which the Hungarians of America came, that is, where we could not get our daily bread, the people who have been taking the bread right off the tables of the wage earners are wading through the blood of the workers and the Jews.",

That is why in this supposedly cultured world of ours, we find a little nation where murder and the blood of innocent people is flowing freely and with impunity. We can understand the good, thinking, faithful people, who in their condemnation weigh others according to their own standards, when they say that there isn't any White Terror or murder of the Jews in Hungary. They don't murder the workers, yet the Christian attitude of tolerance is gone from the Hungarian people. This attitude has been felt by all nations surrounding Hungary, and these nations have expressed themselves as not being able to stand the foul air being let off by Horthy.",

The great Hungarian colony of New York and vicinity spoke at the great Hungarian meetings, where there was no misunderstanding about the attitude of the Hungarian people, and rejected openly the visit of the representative of the White terror.",

This is the reason why it is not sufficient that we alone know the tactics of the White Terror; we must also show Huszar, who can see with his own eyes and hear with his own ears, that the Chicago Hungarians know what he has done to those Hungarians who live across the sea.",

We will endeavor to give our readers the general ideas contained in these letters.",

For two days this man and his family enjoyed each other's company, but on the third day the Czecho-Slovakian government forced him to join their army. The distressed family wrote of their plight to friends in America.",

The writer also states that the Slovak boys living in this county were joining the Hungarian army with great enthusiasm, claiming that if they could endure the World War for five years, they surely could fight the Czecho-Slovaks for one year. These Slavish boys are showing their mettle to Czecho-Slovakia. Regardless of their relationship to the Czecho-Slovaks, they know that their Czecho-Slovak brothers are Cains, and they they do not want to be Abels.",
                "There is another letter which reports that the Czecho-Slovaks have put a barbed-wire fence and have dug a trench along the border and have guards stationed along this fence with orders to shoot down any Hungarian who dares approach the border. It seems that the Hungarian people who emigrated from this country are farther way from their loved ones now than when they were in this country.",

                "He did reach the land of Hungary. He was tired from his long journey and it cost him much money to make the trip. Forgetting this, he was overjoyed that he was now on Hungarian soil. He continued his journey to that little town in which he originally lived.",
                "On his way, he reached the gently flowing waters of the Tisza River, and on the far side he saw the small white house of his own village. Looking across the river to his little village he realized that it was farther away than ever because at that time a Hungarian was not allowed to cross this river.",
                "Through some strange coincidence, his wife found out that her beloved husband was on the far side of the river. Upon reaching the banks of the river, she saw him on the other side. They exchanged greetings and their joy knew no bounds. The husband had come from America to see his loved ones. He knew that if he dared set foot on this Hungarian soil occupied by the Czecho-Slovaks, he would be shot at once. His predicament was worse now than before he emigrated from the United States.",
                "This is the way the man on his way to Szaboles, saw his loved ones.",
                "That beloved Tisza River, which has seen the Huns of Atilla drink its water; Alfred the Conqueror, with the original Hungarians; the Turks, the Tartars, the Russians, and the Slavs, flowed gently on. This river will see a great deal more in the future."

A good portion of this was doubtless furnished by the inhabitants of SZEGEDIN, the second commercial city of the KINGDOM. The terrible distress into which these people have been plunged in consequence of the recent floods calls for a reciprocation by Chicago of their abundant charity, it is therefore proper that the attention of our people should be directed to the matter in an offical manner. The DEAK VEREIN, a HUNGARIAN society in this city, has assumed the task of receiving and forwarding such contributions as may be offered Chicago should give a good account of itself in this HUNGARIAN relief movement. There is little danger that more will be given than is needed to provide for the 80,000 people reduced to destitution by the flood."

The pictures were taken with a really developed sense for selecting the right object in the right place.

The Hungarian Society had invited Mr. Clyde Brown to this celebration in order that the leaders of the various Hungarian associations might have an opportunity to make the acquaintance of this friend of the Hungarians and to thank him for the beautiful pictures taken by him in Hungary, which appeared in the Daily News in series, and which were accompanied by such unusually sympathetic headings, displaying so much good will toward the Hungarians.

One thing stands without question: In the Hungarian Culture achievements he merits an outstanding place in all Chicago. In Chicago he is the creator and pioneer of the Hungarian Singing Club and the amateurship. For five years he was the president of the Chicago (Hungarian Singing Club) Dalkor. He has been teaching the Hungarian Workers' Singing Choir for eleven years. In Milwaukee he was teaching for twelve years and many of his students became good artists. One can not praise as highly enough the pioneering and rearing effects of his teachings. He arranged 235 theatrical plays in Chicago and vicinity. He was born in Budapest, where he finished his high-school. In Milwaukee he finished his studies at the musical-conservatory. Here you have in a nutshell the story of a life rich in activity and achievements."

                "His death leaves a void in the musical world. Sebald's true worth will be appreciated in the future. His technique could not be equalled by the greatest virtuosos, but was imitated by envious violinists. He composed many classical works, but did not care about publishing them. He played them rarely to his music-loving friends.",
                "The tragedy in this great man's life was that he was not satisfied to become a mediocre violinist only, and there were but few experts who could fully appreciate his artistry.",
                "Sebald spent most of his life abroad, but he loved his Mother country and proudly referred to the fact that he was a Hungarian. He came to Chicago in 1912, and for a while, was concert master of the Chicago Grand Opera Company. Later, he taught at the Chicago Musical College. He founded the Chicago String Quartette, which enriched the musical life of our city.",
                "He had no relatives in America, but found friends, who took care of him during his illness amd were with him until his death.",

The Hungarians of America know very well, and can understand what it means when a state, in this present period, must live under the rule of imbeciles. The Hungarian-Americans found out what real liberty was, in this country. So naturally the creation of an independent Hungary means little, unless that independence is combined with democracy. But a democracy can only be established and can only be successful in a republican state; the only way we can assure the future of Hungary now that it is independent is by removing the Hapsburg king from his throne and making it a seat of democracy for the Hungarian republic.",

He promised that he would be willing to sacrifice his entire wealth in order that the Hungarian republic might be realized. According to his statements, Hungary would never be in a position to take the correct steps unless we Hungarians are available to give advice to those in Hungary, so we must wake up. We have a great job ahead of us, and the alarm has sounded; we must answer. Joseph Byfield then read a telegram received from Toby Rubovitz, who is one of the oldest leaders in the fight for a republic. The contents of the telegram were as follows:",
                "If the Hungarian people wished for a republic during Kossuth's time, they wish for it now more than ever. They can't speak because they are muzzled, They cannot act because their hands are tied; for these reasons we in America must act. These words are highly applicable to the situation existing in Hungary today. We all know that it was Joseph Byfield who was instrumental in promoting child welfare work among the children of Hungary. We collected $55,000 for this fund and $2,000 of this was donated by Joseph Byfield.",
                "When Dr. Balthazar, bishop of the Hungarian Reformed Church, was in Chicago for the first time, Joseph Byfield donated a large sum of money for the cause of cultural development in Hungary. There has hardly been an instance when donations were needed by individuals or groups that he has not given wholeheartedly as long as the cause was worthy.",
                "At the time that the names became known of those Hungarian-Americans who had received distinguished service crosses, the name of Joseph Byfield could not be found among them. Even though the Hungarian people turn away from thoughts of the terror-ridden Horthy regime, they cannot understand why Joseph Byfield never received any mention of recognition when he was the one who deserved it more than anyone else. The omission of his name seemed very odd to us, so we thought we would get the facts. We looked up Mr. Byfield and asked him if he knew why he had not been honored. His simple answer was that Scheffbeck, the Hungarian consul, wanted to decorate him with the Horthy distinguished service cross but he would not accept it because sometime ago, he had refused to accept the American distinguished service medal.",
                "Here is a man who has remained loyal to the promise which he made in 1918. He has remained faithful and loyal. The Hungarians have always respected Joseph Byfield, but for his latest patriotic deeds the Hungarians have locked him in their hearts and will think of him always with deep appreciation. We sincerely hope that the example set by Mr. Byfield will be a guide in showing us the duties of Hungarian-Americans."

                "The news of the death of Samuel Ladanyi was like a thunderbolt from the sky striking into the hearts of the Chicago Hungarians. This man who a short time ago was full of vitality and great plans has left us, [and we are shocked by such a catastrophe].",
                "Samuel Ladanyi was born on Jan. 2, 1867, in Szabolcs County, Hungary. After completing his education, like many thousands of other Hungarians, he found it hard to locate himself in the industrial life of Hungary, so he decided to migrate to America.",
                "At first he settled in New York City where he suffered many hardships, as did all immigrants. But these hardships and trials only spurred his ambition to become a success.",
                "He came to Chicago a few decades ago, and during the Chicago World's Fair introduced the Hungarian frankfurter to the American public. His frankfurters became so popular that he and his uncle organized what is known today as the Vienna Sauage Mfg. Co. In the last ten years he has been a pioneer in the development of smoked meats. His sausage factory prospered, and as the years went by it became larger and larger, until today it is one of the largest of its kind. Its yearly business amounts to more than a million dollars.",
                "Samuel Ladanyi became a wealthy man. He did not [make the same mistake which other Hungarians who acquired wealth, made--i. e. adopt a superior attitude toward their poorer brethren]. He remained the same, common, ordinary man. [His simplicity]was shown in his home and in [his method of]handling people.",
                "Although he behaved as a common, ordinary man, his thoughts, feelings and activities made him a great man.",
                "Samuel Ladanyi was an honest man, a good Hungarian, and a loyal Jew. These three characteristics were blended so well within him that he was loved by all who came in contact with him.",
                "He glorified the Hungarian nation because regardless of whom he met, he was always proud to acknowledge his Hungarian descent.",
                "He was always willing to donate to a good cause. He never showed partiality. His activities were governed by the dictates of the Old Testament. He practiced the dictum that what his right hand did, his left hand knew nothing of. There was never a worth-while Hungarian activity which he did not support. No one left his home empty handed. He was a great supporter of all cultural activities amongst the Hungarians and gave aid to their theatrical projects.",
                "A man can be a hard worker--he can be wealthy and wise--but if he can't gain the confidence of his fellow man, his life is one without purpose. Fame and fortune die, but the activities and the results of those activities remain [and influence the future].",
                "The fact that eight hundred businessmen were present [at the funeral] to pay their last respects to the man who had been so humanitarian, testifies to the respect which he commanded, and the love that existed for him among the Hungarians in Chicago.",
                "The educated and the uneducated, the rich and the poor, can feel that someone of great importance has passed away because a great man was lowered into his grave, to rest in peace."

                "There is hardly a Hungarian whose name appears as often as Joska De Babary's in the musical world and in the columns of the daily newspapers. He was taught by two of the world's foremost music teachers, Hubaynal and Sevcsik.",
                "When Joska De Babary finished his musical training, he toured all of central Europe. During this tour he was recognized by the European press as one of the finest violin soloists in Europe. After being in this country for a short time the American press also acclaimed him. Mr. DeVries, music critic for the Evening American, praised him highly for his performance--this is something that Mr. DeVries seldom does.",
                "When Babary was a child he played for the mother of the present Russian Czar. Two years ago when Babary came to this country, he organized a string quartet with which he is making personal appearances in the Louis XVI room in the Congress Hotel. He is also a professor of music at the Sherwood Conservatory in the Fine Arts Building.",
                "The Babary quartet proved to be a sensation on the radio, while the solo performance of Joska De Babary was outstanding. The radio audience flooded the station with so many letters and telegrams that they were forced to put Babary on a daily program on a national hook-up over station K.Y.W. in Chicago. And thus all of the United States became part of his audience."
