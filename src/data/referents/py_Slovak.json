However, Miss Rozbesky is not satisfied with being an elementary teacher; she is going right ahead with higher studies, so as to qualify for a position, as high school teacher.

Haven't you heard me say that cursing offends God!' 'Yes! replied the boy laconically 'but my dad curses, not only once in a day, but any number of times.' In great amazement the rest of the boys looked at each other as the young offender made this reply. Is it any wonder then that some of our young boys take to cursing, when the father sets the example! It is deplorable, fathers, the way you are raising your sons!

Czechoslovakian grafters have imposed themselves on all valuable property owned by the Slovak people. Our Slovak Lutheran public were robbed not only of thousands of organizations, but also of Slovak national consciousness, national feeling, and national character. With the unfortunate Czechoslovakism, they have hypnotized the Slovak Lutherans so that they nationally, politically, and culturally remain inactive. The Slovak Lutherans have resigned from all activities in national and political enterprises. They are sitting in a corner idly, crying that the Catholics took everything from us.'\"",

Consequently, both sides began to argue the matter. The Bohemians stated that the name may be spelled without hyphen because it is known among them that they are two separate nations, but the outside world considers us as one, and, therefore, we spell the name as one and show the world our unison. Mr. Poliak and Doctor Hletko stressed the fact that if the exposition and the other projects of the committees are to be successful, they must have the strength and the support of both Czechs and Slovaks. They also stated that if the name is not hyphenated, the Slovaks will not take part in this venture.",

This individual had visited Czecho-Slovakia during the summer. It gave him the opportunity to study the conditions and political situation of the country. He related his experience to us and did not deny the fact that Slovaks in their country are being treated unjustly by their brothers, the Czechs. He accused the Slovak leaders of being responsible for the deplorable conditions in their native land. He stated that if leaders would unite and take the matter into their own hands, they could send the Czechs into exile within twenty-four hours, and then the Slovaks would become rulers.",

It seems, nevertheless, that the mentioned \"Czecho-Slovakian mutuality\" is only a fantasy of some individuals and exists only on paper."

Stevens, an American, says that if a person could choose his nationality at birth, he would choose to be a Slovak, because the average Slovak has no equal. The French artist Contee says that a nation born with such natural ability must be spiritually endowed. Former President William Howard Taft once said: \"The Slovak is one of the most industrious, tender-hearted, and romantic of our immigrants; he is deeply interested in our American ways and customs and possesses a large measure of worldly wisdom. Therefore, I welcome him.\" This should be an inspiration to some of our Chicago Slovaks who sit back and watch the other fellow do it, and all he can offer is criticism. Unity and solidarity is what we need."

However, there is some misunderstanding, whether intentional or not, which is holding the progress of the club in abeyance.

Students are requested to apply for membership cards which will entitle them to participate in the sublime work for God and Nation."

Other things necessary are warning signs to motorists for the protection of school children, the completion of the Verdi High School, at 56th and Rockwell Streets, and the universal transfer system on street-cars and buses. For the accomplishment of these and other purposes it is vitally necessary that every Slovak of this vicinity shall become a member of the Slovak Civic Organization of Town of Lake."

Quite a number of politicians who were present were indeed surprised to see the strength and solid front the Chicago Slovaks possess, a fact which made them realize that the Chicago Slovaks, through solidarity, can make or break any local political candidate, and that, consequently, they must be reckoned with."

The Slovaks, however, had a different opinion in the matter. They mentioned the fact that when the contract was signed between both nationalities, the committee was called Czecho-Slovak. Our brothers the Czechs stated that we should appear before the public as a Czechoslovakian nation and apply the hyphen only in the Slovak and Bohemian connection.

This is to be the grand opening of a fifty acre grove put aside by Mr. Tomala for the benefit of his friends and patrons, in fact for all Slovaks of this vicinity, to be used by them as a place of recreation. There is no doubt in our minds that whoever sees this place will like it. So far, everyone has. The location and scenery are ideal. There are fifty acres in all, twenty-five of which are wooded. The rest is rolling hills and prairie, with a baseball diamond and an automobile parking lot. It is also an excellent place for those who love to hike. Being located at Archer Road and 135th St., it has easy access from Chicago and Joliet. The grounds will be opened at 10 A. M. Admission will be free and everyone is welcome."

If he does join a Slovak organization it is not through love and principle. Oh no! It is for the purpose of furthering his own selfish interests. \"Brothers and sisters: This will never do!\" We must co-operate, work in harmony, join our local churches, prevail upon our fellow countrymen and prove to them the necessity of doing this; in this way we will rise to the same level of other progressive communities."

It is the product of the skill of Mrs. Mary Matusek, a resident of Pullman, Illinois. It is not for sale, because at the close of the Bazaar it is to be sent to the President as a token of the deep reverence which the Chicago Slovak colony harbors for the man who declared himself to be a protagonist of freedom for all small nations, regardless of their size. This is going to be a gift befitting the occasion and will, doubtless, be accepted with gratitude."

                "The first game between Assumption and St. Joseph was a one-sided affair, for Assumption outhit and outplayed the boys from the near North Side. Assumption collected 10 runs, 12 hits, and erred twice; St. Joseph could only muster one run out of 4 hits and booted the ball twice. The heavy hitting was done by Assumption. Cibira and Pes socked the ball for a double apiece and \"Blackie\" Adamcik smacked a homer. Roth started for St. Joseph, but under the heavy barrage was relieved by Kalasa, the former struck out 3 men and the latter fanned 2. S. Mikos, pitching for Assumption, gave the air to 9 men. The feature of this game was the fielding of Mestan and Adamcik. Only one double play was completed and that went to St. Joseph. This eliminated St. Joseph from the contest.",
                "The second game between Assumption, the winners of the first contest and St. Stephen was a nip and tuck battle interspersed with some football. From the first inning until the last ball was thrown, the fans roared, razzed, insulted and did everything a fan would to at a deciding game. Although St. Stephen's were outhit, they were not outplayed. It was just a tough battle. Contributors in the slugfest of Assumption were: Adamcik, Skriba, Vallach, and Mikos, with doubles; \"Lefty\" Skriba also socked a triple for good measure. Assumption made one double play; Mikula to Cibira to Skriba. St. Stephen had 2 double plays, the first was started by F. Sic, with the assistance of Dancik and J. Sic. The second double play engineered by \"Shorty\" Vasko was a corker, with 3 men on base \"Shorty\" caught a fly ball in deep left field and made a bullet-like throw to the plate, getting his man. Szany, St. Stephen 3rd sacker, played a marvelous game for St. Stephen, but was relieved by \"Jumbo\" Bojnansky. As Szany left the field the fans arose and cheered him lustily. Biros pitched 5 innings for Assumption, allowing 7 hits and striking out 3 Stephenites; Mikos in relief role allowed only 1 hit and struck out 5 men. \"Durk\" Duray allowed 12 hits and fanned 9 of the Assumption men. The final score was St. Stephen, 6; Assumption, 5. This game was witnessed by many Jednotars who have been following the game all season. However, the Slovaks were outnumbered by the total strangers who commented on the game, and the players' conduct afield. Those responsible for the ungentlemanly conduct should be ashamed to face the fans again.",

Both of the teams were neck and neck for six innings, the tie finally was broken by St. Stephen who held a one run lead until the end. St. Joseph played very loose, causing three of St. Stephen runs to be unearned. Three times St. Joseph had the bags loaded but the batters could not deliver.",
                "Consequently the game went to St. Stephen by a score of 5 to 4. The regular league meeting ended in a near riot because the officers found it necessary to shorten the schedule in order to allow the Chicago champions to travel to Youngstown on the 19th of August. All the managers were in accord with the officers of the league, except Manager Churilla, who argued that he should play the regular scheduled game.",
                "On account of shortening the schedule, several teams who are not contenders for the championship voluntarily forfeited their games to the contestants. Consequently there is a three-way tie: Assumption, St. Joseph, and St. Stephen. To break this three-way tie and decide the champions of this league there will be a double header played at Fernwood Park at 104th and Wallace Sts. There are plenty grandstand seats and room for all Jednota fans."

Nemcek will probably be out for the remainder of the season on account of a fractured hip, caused by colliding with Kalasa.",
                "St. Stephen again displayed their superiority on the baseball field by a shutout over St. John's, of Roseland. The final score in eight innings was St. Stephen 11, St. John O. \"Durk\" did the chucking for St. Stephen, and how he can fool them. During the eight innings he did not permit a hit or a run to mar the day. \"Durk\"probably would not have been as effective were it not for the receiving department which was ably handled by Gurican, a smart catcher, always studying the opposing batsmen to determine their weakness. Bojnansky put a home-run ticket on a ball, but Horny of St. John stretched far enough to pull it down for an out. It seems that St. John's are a trifle weak with their pitching staff, that just can't seem to get started. At Harrison High School grounds the St. George's infield was letting the ball go between their legs and hands and consequently remained on the short end after nine innings. Assumption's superior batting and fielding defeated the St. George 10 to 7. \"Chuck\" Derbas, another rookie hurler, did some fine twirling, but of no avail; he allowed only seven hits in eight innings. \"Steve\" Mirolak, St. George's centerfielder started the game by knocking the first ball pitched for two bases. He later scored on a hit by A. Vraniak, J. Pes, and \"Lefty\" Skriba contributed to the misery of St. George by smacking homers over the right field fence. Assumption played fine defensive ball, turning in three double plays. It is evident from what the Jednota fans have seen that Assumption and St. Stephen are real contenders for the pennant. The Jednota games are being well attended but the senior members and officers of the organization have made themselves scarce and are not attending as they should. Sunday, June 10, is the last day for registering players; after that day no additions will be allowed."

The game terminated in the 6th inning, because of permit regulations, with this final score: St. Stephen, 11; Assumption 5. Assumption started their half of the first inning with a triple by \"Lefty\" Skriba's scoring the runner ahead of him. However, tables turned in the fourth behind the relief pitching of \"Durk\" Duray, who allowed only three hits in three innings and whiffed six Assumption sluggers.

On the far south side, St. John's were taking St. Andrew's into camp to the tune of twelve to eleven. The day was marked with errors on both teams, which probably was the aftermath of the League dance held Saturday night. T. Balas, of St. John, did some wonderful relief work, allowing only one hit in four innings, and that a home run by W. Matula. The heavy artillery consisted of Ed. Beno who had four hits out of five times at bat and R. Kapicak with three out of four. Another upset was the defeat of St. Joseph's by St. George's Sokol with a score of six to two. The game only lasted seven innings on account of time. Skanda, of St. George, contributed a home run with two men on in the first inning, thus putting St. George in the lead which they maintained throughout the game.

It was resolved that the payment of death benefits should continue, and that every member of the various organizations should be assessed ten cents per month for a \"war fund\" that is to become a sort of reserve in case there are too many death benefits to be paid. The measure may not prove sufficient, and the organizations will probably increase the assessment; this is expected to happen after the second levy."

                "The month of June ends the school term. A great number of our youth leave school with the conviction of being one degree closer to their goal. Many of them will receive diplomas as a reward for their effort, and will then enter into a more serious life. They have, however, a long way to go before they are prepared to participate in the affairs of the public, as professional individuals, and to solve the critical problems of the period. We are certain that a great percentage of those who have vocations have sacrificed, a large portion of their youthful life for their education. Many self-denials and sacrifices were required to attain their purpose. They yearned for the light of knowledge and desired to see the dawn of a new day which would take them out of the darkness of ignorance, regardless of cost. It is true that the price which they paid was high, because society today, does not give anything free of charge. In some cases the price they paid was double what it should have been, and yet many of them were given only half of what was due them. Now they have finished their studies and are standing on the threshold of a new life; they rejoice in even that half amount.",
                "American-Slovaks are proud of those who have reached maturity, and they exult in their success. We trust, that they will work for the Slovak race, propagate national consciousness among our Slovak brothers and defend the honor and good name of the Slovak nation in public. Only for one reason may the American-Slovaks make claim for the youth's support in the national field; and that is because these young people were reared in the Slovak spirit, attended Slovak schools where the Slovak tongue and the love for their nation is instilled in them in the early part of their life.",
                "The future of the American-Slovaks lies in their training. It is a known fact, that Slovak immigration is restricted; we cannot depend on strength and aid from the outside; therefore, it is our duty to rear men and women who will perform the Slovak mission, and awaken national conciousness among American-Slovaks.",
                "Our younger generation must be brought up in the Slovak spirit. This can be accomplished by sending our children to Slovak schools where patriotism and the Slovak language are cultivated."

In the short time of his residence here as a free Slovak he has made use of his opportunity to better himself, and with new hope and energy he has begun to establish large organizations, businesses, real-estate developments, schools, and churches. For this reason and for many others we are undeniably under obligation to take part in the celebration of the Washington anniversary.",
                "We are certain that the day will be properly observed by us if all Slovaks will unite with thousands of other American citizens to celebrate it. Let Slovaks with their clubs and other organizations assemble on July 17, 1932, in Pilsen Park, at 26th Street and Albany Avenue.",

Preparations are being made for making the affair a success, one of the greatest that Slovaks ever will witness. Many famous speakers will be present, and the public is assured of an interesting program.",

The Czechs insist the name is not to be hyphenated and the \"S\" not capitalized. Some of the Slovak representatives protested and resigned from the committee which represented 50,000 Slovaks residing in Chicago, and more than a million Slovaks in America. We approve of the resignations and, therefore, we congratulate our representative, Dr. Peter Hletko, and give full credit to the other representatives who joined him in the protest.

Very seldom does this type of person contribute anything toward the maintenance of his church, he is, nevertheless, always ready to criticise our clergy and their conduct. His presence in church is not due to piety, but merely one of duty.

You all are acquainted with the purpose of this movement; therefore, interest your sons and daughters in the Student Federation, promote good will and co-operation among them, and eventually our purpose shall be accomplished.

But heavens above, that is not Americanism! A person so utterly lacking in feeling is no more a genuine American than was the patriot of Ku Klux Klan days, who called himself \"a one hundred per cent American\" because he wore a nightshirt in public.",

We want the reader to know what the Pact guaranteed, how the stipulations of the Pact were ignored, and what flimsy objections were raised relative to the validity of the Pact by those who were parties to that Pact and who later became interested that the provisions of the Pact should be ignored.

I advise all Slovaks to buy a copy of it, not only because it gives all the pertinent facts about a historical document that is destined to effect Czecho-Slovak relations for a long time to come, but also because by buying a copy they will help defray the expense of distributing the brochure gratis to the more important American libraries and newspapers. Thus, for twenty-five cents they will give themselves a treat and, at the same time, do a bit of missionary work for the cause of Slovak Liberty."

                "Doctor Peter Hletko is not chief physician of the Tatrian Slovak Union anymore. This position was taken away from him, without his knowledge, last Sunday at an annual meeting of the executive board of the above mentioned organization.\n   In his place, Dr. Rurik was chosen. Has Dr. P. Hletko not fulfilled his duties or did he not meet the requirements of the executive board?\n   There are other organizations which are satisfied with his work; therefore, it is strange that he did not satisfy the requirements of the\n   Tatrian Slovak Union. The reason probably is that Doctor Hletko is a Catholic. Therefore, he became a victim of circumstances.\n   It is evident that the situation in America is similar to Czecho-Slovakia. In that country a loyal Slovak has not a place in any\n   public office, and it is likewise here in America."

                "On his return from a two-month visit with his parents in Europe, Florian V. Tylka, treasurer of Club Furdek and editor of Osadne Hlasy, was surprised with a social given in his honor by the members of Club Furdek. The affair took place Thursday evening, September 10, in St. Michael's Parish Hall, where a goodly number of club members had gathered. The social began with a welcome address by Mr. Joseph Steller, president of the club, who also acted as master of ceremonies. After a fine supper prepared by the Ladies Auxiliary, the program continued with speeches by Adam Poliak, Stephen Skriba, and Reverend Fathers John Fedor, Charles Florek, OSB., Joseph Rondzik, and John Rondzik. Mr. F. V. Tylka expressed his heartfelt appreciation of this cordial welcome. Between speeches the audience was entertained with a vocal solo by Miss Claudia Mika and a piano selection by Miss Marian Fabry. This was followed by dancing and everyone present had a good time."

                "Slovaks! Would you enjoy looking at your native land, the beautiful Slovakia, from whence you have been driven? Who would not care to see the town in which he spent his youth? Apparently, there is not anyone who has had the opportunity to visit his homeland because the economic situation was unfavorable. Therefore, many were content with having work, at least, to make a living. How many were able to accompany the Sokols Athletic demonstration to Prague? We have heard much gossip about Russia. Some claim living conditions are good; others claim the contrary. Who tells the truth? You can all see and hear for yourselves on Sunday, at 2:30 or 7 P.M., when the first showing of a film appears at the Bohemian-American Auditorium, 1440 West Eighteenth Street, admission 25\u00a2.",
                "The American League of Slovaks and Bohemians will show an entirely new film from Czecho-Slovakia. The League assures the public that the film is beautiful as well as interesting. The larger part of the picture concerns Slovakia. The remaining portions show Bohemia, Moravia, Russia, and all of the performances of the Sokols of the entire world.",
                "There will be a lecture following the film by Professor B. Mikula. Also there will be musical selections of Slovak songs and violin music.",
