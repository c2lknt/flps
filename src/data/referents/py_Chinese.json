                "Our ever-increasing associations with the foreign world are beginning to penetrate the foundation of our 6,000-year-old civilization, foreshadowing changes in the social and economic fabric, and in the traditional philosophy and ethical outlook of our people, of greater significance than the more dramatic changes in the political sphere.",
                "Our virtually unchangeable independent ideals have, at long last, come to submit and to react to extraneous influences. We are beginning to realize that the stability of our age-old civilization has left us trailing behind the comparatively new nations. We are convinced that a momentous transformation must take its course. But little are we aware of the fact that there are no other influences that have done and will do more to unify the people, reconcile diverse points of view, eliminate provincial or state jealousies, set ideals for the people, and train leaders for the service of the state and the nation, than nationalized education.",
                "Indeed, modern industry and forms of government demand in the average citizen a higher standard of knowledge and training than formerly sufficed. Education aims at conserving and perfecting the life of the community, but that life is nothing other than the life of the individual. Education, then, is the determiner of a person's future.",
                "A school, the generally recognized center of education, when its functions are properly performed, is a genuine society inspired by the best ideals of national character and therefore able to transmit to and confirm in its pupils the traits which enter into those ideals ideals of the new and not of the old.",
                "Whether or not a school is capable of performing its functions properly depends entirely upon the structure and organization of a nationalized educational system, a system which provides for all citizens the acquisition of individual development through the so called \"public school education,\" an organization which possesses its distinctive feature in the replacement of the old conception, - in which schools corresponded mainly to social stratification, - by the idea that children of all classes should have an equal opportunity at a primary education designed to meet the needs of childhood, followed by a post-primary or secondary education adjusted to the needs of adolescence. Thus a young man is at last equipped with the common knowledge of his social and economic responsibilities and activities in his immediate community.",
                "The so-called \"public school education\" has enabled the young man to weigh the difference between the primitive tendency of a community towards the complete subordination of an individual and the modern tendency towards the increasing valuation of individual life. Education, therefore, is indeed the stimulating factor in a child's - a youth's - a young man's ever-increasing realization of his individual valuation to his community, state and national government.",
                "It is obvious, then, that the individuals or citizens make a country; education makes an individual; and, therefore, education makes a country.",
                "It is no doubt easy to visualize and to realize the importance of education, primary, elementary, and public-to-a nation, but to establish and to perform a nationalized educational system is another question - it is difficult. I say it is difficult, especially in our country, because of its tremendously vast area, unstable political situation, inefficient transportation and communication, and lastly, lack of economic nationalism. But in view of these unquestionable obstacles our duty is to rouse the spirit of the people of the republic to perform the seemingly impossible in order to accomplish the indispensable.",
                "Surely, we can recall what Dr. Sun Yat-Sen did for our country. Yes, he performed what the people of prior to 1911 thought was impossible. But in October, 1911, the nation witnessed the miraculous change - from an Imperialistic government of four millenium to the present day Republican government. I say, therefore, if there is will there is power.",
                "Knowing what is indispensable to our nation, let us all put forth the individual efforts in performing the impossible and the acquiring of the indispensable - the nationalization of educational system.",
                "My personal opinion is that an efficient nationalized educational system must embody the following factors:",
                "1. The organization of a board of education in town, city, county, state, and headed by the executive committee of the education department in the central government. Like a national government, the educational system must be efficiently organized and maintaining an absolute relationship between the sub-department and the central office.",
                "2. Any educational fundamentals, reports, changes and functions must be opinioned by the national experts and then sanctioned by the national executive committee of the central education department before they are to be nationalized.",
                "3. Executive orders of the central office of the department of education must be strictly observed by the state, county, city and township boards. Any plans or schemes of specific changes and improvements of certain localities should be presented by the township board to its immediate superior who in turn will do likewise, which means, eventually, that the national executive committee of the educational department will directly supervise all changes and improvements in all localities - a system of efficient nationalization.",
                "4. The state should be responsible in developing the middle class talent, and the national central office should be responsible in the making of all talented research workers and specialists.",
                "5. All educational commissioners and staff members should be supported by the locality with the sanction of the national central office. In case of financial insufficiency or over-appropriation for such a program, the central office should see to the balance.",
                "6. Elementary and middle school operations should be financed by the city and state, and the national central office should finance educational institutions beyond the middle school - such as colleges and technical institutions, etc.",
                "In case a city or a state is unable to raise sufficient funds for its own elementary and middle school expenditures, the central office will, naturally, supplement the balance.",
                "7. Experimentation in the field of educational functions is very essential. Each locality or township should be allowed the opportunity, without national interference, for educational experimentations which, of course, must not go beyond the central office educational fundamentals. This opportunity will naturally encourage unlimited progress and expansion in all localities.",
                "8. If a town or a city is unable to establish its elementary and middle school, or such operation may involve more than one town or city, then the state should take the full responsibility.",
                "If educational functions should involve more than one state, the operation automatically becomes a national central office problem.",
                "In other words, the national executive council of the educational central office should always be the basic foundation in all educational enterprises - giving, however, all chances possible to staff members of each locality through out the nation for a maximum exercise of initiative in supplying the exact need of their own locality.",
                "If we can consider thoroughly the above factors in the nationalization of our educational system, I am sure the result will not be far from what has been accomplished by this country.",
                "In promoting such a program may I say that we who are abroad, especially in this country, should assume the leadership. The reason is because we are living in a country with a perfect educational system, a country which has achieved more during the past century than any other nation in the world, due largely if not totally, to its efficient educational system. We who realize the important part education is playing in national standing, should, therefore, do our utmost in promoting and advancing the efficient nationalization of our educational system."

                "Education may well be divided into two distinctive classes, they are school education and home education. The latter is generally termed \"home-training\" and is fundamentally most important as it deals with the most plastic years of a human being. In fact, home-training is so important that it guides and sometimes determines our future. Upon the shoulders of our parents, then, rests the vital responsibility of home-training.",
                "Parents, who are ready to undertake the difficult task of raising children, should first of all, realize that their children are born innocent, and they must see to it that their innocence is not jeopardized by ignorance.",
                "The innocent children are born with the instinct of imitation and learn through their senses of hearing and seeing. They know not right from wrong, nor wrong from right. Whatever they see, they do; whatever they hear, they say. It is, therefore, important that good parents watch their own conversation and actions. If the parents, unfortunately, should possess some undesirable habits, they should refrain from indulging in them in the presence of their alert children, because rarely do the children have habits which they have not acquired from their parents. Fortunate indeed are parents, to have the privilege to play such an important role in the life of the next generation! But how delicate, how important, and how difficult, is their task! Unfortunately because parents are unable to Perform such a task, we have our wide national illiteracy.",
                "Besides home-training then, is the equally important school education, We, undoubtedly, know that the responsibility rests with the teachers and instructors The teachers' responsibility should not be a mere scholastic achievenemt but should rather be the character formation of the students. We regret to admit again that the lack of a nation-wide educational system and the ignorance on the part of our teachers as to their real duty is the second of the two predominant factors in our national illiteracy.",
                "Our corruptive educational system of the Chin Dynasty need no further expression of opinions as we all are more or less acquainted with it. But the so-called modern educational system of today is what we are concerned with. It is a pity that a good percentage of our modern teachers have neglected their fundamental duty of character building. In fact, teachers who live the lives of play-boys have become numerous. And there are teachers who are so involved in politics that they can practically call their schools political centers. No doubt, these vices and hobbies are but personal characteristics, but they are of such an import to the future of the students that we who are interested in our children's welfare must take immediate action.",
                "The responsibility of the parents in the homes and of the teachers in the schools is clear to us. No doubt, we are away from our homeland but if we perform our duties here in our Chicago Chinese community efficiently we shall soon find our children playing an important part in the development of our national life.",
                "Parents who are interested in our national welfare should pay immediate attention to the home-training of their children. And to the teachers may we suggest that they should refrain from political activities and be molders of character as well as teachers of learning. With the fullest cooperation of all concerned, we are sure, our country will soon be one of the strongest in the world."

It was their New Year's day, the anniversary of the ascension to the throne of the present ruler of the Chinese Empire, and every one of the hundreds of Mongolians in Chicago was out in holiday attire. All work was suspended, and the scores of dingy, dark basement laundries were lit up for the first time in a year. The walls and windows were decorated with bright colored papers inscribed with words of praise to Joss and the Emperor. In most cases temporary altars were erected, and thanks offerings of flesh and fruit were burned with myrrh and frankincense and aloes, according to a custom said to have been established a thousand years before the Christian era.",

                "The Chinese grocery which occupies the first floor was cleared of all merchandise, and the place was fitted up to represent a Joss house. From the ceiling were hung numerous highly-colored rice paper banners. In the rear and above the image of Joss were thirteen of them, inscribed in gilt with the thirteen Chinese classics, the work of Kien-loong, an Emperor of great wisdom, who has rested in his grave hundreds of years. Along the north wall were the five virtues handed down by Confucius. They are benevolence, righteousness, propriety, knowledge, and faith. Beneath a portrait of Confucius were the words he is said to have uttered on his deathbed: \"The great mountain is broken. The strong beam is thrown down, and the wise man is decayed.\"",
                "On a large table in front of the image of Joss were the bronze vessels in which sweet smelling spices were burning. Artistically arranged about these were offerings of Chinese sweet meats, chicken, and roast pig. In a comfortable room on the second floor was Mrs. May Chung Hoy, wife of one of the three brothers who own the hotel. On her lap was little May Fook Kan, who was christened with pagan pomp and ceremony several months ago. Her costume differed little from that of her husband. Her blouse was of heavy, light blue silk with pink sleeves, and her limbs were incased in wide legged trousers of purple silk. Gold rings at least six inches in circumference adorned her ears, and around her neck was a heavy gold band. Her hair was combed straight back from her forehead and wound in an odd coil at the back of her head. The coil could scarcely be seen for the gold and turquoise ornaments which adorned her. The chubby legs and arms of the son of May Chung Hoy were loaded with gold bracelets, and on his head was a quaint silk cap covered with metal ornaments, which jingled every time the baby moved. His dress was of light purple silk, with long flowing sleeves.",

Meats, breads, vegetables, and queer dishes, familiar only to these strange people, were scattered in profusion. While it was all going on a large caldron containing consecrated paper made of an imported punk that had been prepared by the chief religion officer of China, produced a dense smoke, as it was arranged to burn slowly.",

Many thought the pigtails were dedicating their new monument and in order to learn whether of not this had been done Hip Lung was questioned. \"It is not a dedication of the monument\", said he. It is our custom of feeding the dead. We will not dedicate the monument until next Sunday. We feed our dead today, tonight we feed some of our living - the laundry men\".",

M. the large dining hall on the second floor of Lung's building was ablaze, and the Laundrymen of Chicago enjoyed a banquet such as was never seen or tasted here before. It was given because a nephew had been born to Hip Lung."

One of these is the burning every morning of certain sheets of brownish paper, upon one side of which is a surface of gold, a similar embellishment of silver being on the other side. Then there are tapers, long slender reed like affairs, which smolder slowly, whose destruction by fire is supposed to have an especially satisfactory effect upon the deity which presides over Mongolian destinies.",

                "During the remainder of this week the fun will be kept up in a quiet way, but next Sunday it is intended to have a mighty gathering of Celestials. There is to be a dinner with Chinese delicacies intermingling on the same board with turkey, roast beef, wine, lager beer and other American institutions, and after the good things have been disposed of there are to be speech-making, music, card-playing (Bill Nye excluded), and other forms of jollity and enjoyment. The only trouble is that when a Chinaman is asked where the entertainment is to come off, his face brightens up with an Ah Sin smile, and he claims that he does not know anything further about it, with an expression of innocence that is most surprising.",

                "Resolved, That we hail the present opening as particularly affording a grand and auspicious opportunity to the Christian people of this country for the evangelization of the Mongolian race in our own country.",
                "Resolved, That it is peculiarly fitting for us as a denomination- identified as we are, in spirit and history, with the free institutions of this nation-to give full and distinct utterance to the sentiment of a common brotherhood in regard to the Chinese, by welcoming them to our land, our charities, and our sanctuaries.",
                "Resolved, That we recognize in this movement a solemn call, addressed to us in the Providence of God to consider well our Christian obligations to the Chinese, and if possible, in cooperation with our brethren, early to inaugurate some plan to bring them under the influence of the Gospel."

                "Chinatown is embroiled in a bitter factional strife between two of its leading families, and Wong Chin Foo, the leader of the Wong faction in its prosecution of the Moy faction, has declared open hostility against State's Attorney Kern. The reason he gives is, that in his opinion, he cannot obtain justice through Mr. Kern in the case of Wong Aloy, in whose interests he came from New York. The fight grew out of an assault which was made upon Wong Aloy, a Chinese student at Evanston, by Moy Toi Nye and Ung Yok the night of March 29 last in front of 307 South Clark Street. The assailants were arrested and placed under a $2,000 bond by Justice Clemon. The prosecution was represented by Attorney John B. Strassburger, who had taken an interest in Wong Aloy and who now harbors him at his home, where the Chinaman is still confined in bed as a consequence of the injuries received.",
                "The Wong family, however, believed that a more vigorous prosecution would be made if their side of the case could be presented in court by an English speaking Chinaman and after holding a consultation telegraphed to Wong Chin Foo to come and assist in the prosecution. Wong Chin Foo arrived in Chicago on April 2 in response to this call.",
                "Among the first things which Wong Chin Foo advised was the rearrest of the assailants, which was effected. Their bond was raised to $12,000. The bondsmen of Moy Toi Nye and Ung Yok were Hip Lung, whose real name is Moy Choong Few, and Sam Moy. Between these two men, who represent the Moy family and Wong Chin Foo, who represents the Wong family, is the bitter fight. It is openly asserted by Wong Chin Foo that he is unable to secure justice from State's Attorney Kern and that it is impossible for any Chinaman in the city of Chicago who is not friendly to the Moy family to obtain justice through him. In corroboration, as he thought, of this statement Wong Chin Foo, who speaks unusually good English, told the following story yesterday to a reporter of the Tribune:",
                "\"State's Attorney Kern sent word to Inspector Koch of the Harrison Street Station last Friday morning that he wanted to see me at his office. As soon as I was notified by the Inspector, I hired a cab and drove to Mr. Kern's office in company with two detectives from the Central Station, whom I took along as witnesses. On our arrival there I was asked to step into Mr. Kern's private office alone. As soon as the door was closed and we were alone, Mr. Kern dropped into a chair, crossed his legs upon the table and turning suddenly toward me, began the following conservation 'I know you,' he said. \"'I am glad that I need no introduction, then,\"' I replied.",
                "'You have come to Chicago to make trouble. You are a fomenter of trouble and a disturber of the peace among Chinamen.' I was amazed and said: \"'I guess you have mistaken the man.'\" 'No,' he repled, 'I know you through previous disturbances that have taken place in the city. You came here a few years ago and created dissention among the Chinamen.' \"'It is true,'\" I replied, \"'that I came here a few years ago, but it was for the purpose of quelling a disturbance among my countrymen and in this task I succeeded.'\" 'I have my information from Sam Moy,' said Mr. Kern, 'who is a resident of Chicago and I prefer his testimony to yours. Moreover I want you to understand that if you prosecute Sam Moy or Hip Lung you prosecute me. Those men are my friends and in no case will I prosecute them.' \"' When the Chinamen told me,'\" I replied, \"' that whatever Sam Moy or Hip Lung did they were all right with the State's Attorney, I did not believe them.'\" 'You may believe them. It is true,' said Mr. Kern. \"Very well then,'\" I replied, \"'I will drop Hip Lung and Sam Moy and will fight you. I have fought the New York police and other formidable opponents in the attempt to secure justice for my countrymen and I do not shrink from this conflict. My life is dedicated to the cause of securing them justice and if I loose it in the attempt it will be an honorable death.'\"",
                "John B. Strassburger, the Attorney for Wong Aloy said to a reporter of the Tribune:",
                "\"I went to Mr. Kern and sought his assistance in prosecuting this case. The grand jury was in session and the request might very properly, as it seems to me, have been granted. Mr. Kern refused it and made no secret of the fact that Sam Moy and Hio Lung were his friends, although he did not base his refusal on those grounds. While I have no proof I feel morally certain that Judge Longenerker would have granted my request.\"",
                "State's Attorney made the following explanation to a reporter of the Tribune yesterday of the interview with Wong Chin Foo: \"In my opinion Wong Chin Foo is an adventurer. He came to Chicago at this time, I think, for the purpose of stirring up a quarrel among the Chinamen, that he may reap benefit from it. I understand from Hip Lung, whom I have known for a number of years as a prosperous merchant and peaceful man, that he is considered a professional mischief-maker, who travels about among his people in an ostensibly, self-sacrificing manner for his personal profit. I think, I understand Chinamen thoroughly, and believing that Wong Chin Foo had come here to create trouble in Chinatown, I thought the surest way of averting it would be to read the riot act to him. Accordingly I unfolded my plan to Inspector Koch and sent word through him to Wong Chin Foo that I wished to see him here. When he came I talked to him rather savagely and gave him plainly to understand, that he might look for no help through this department in stirring up trouble which threatened the city's peace. In doing this I performed what I believed to be my duty. To Mr. Strassburger I said that a precedent had been established in this office, that no criminals except fugitives from justice should be presented until they had obtained a preliminary hearing and were duly bound over to the grand jury. I told Wong Chin Foo if it had been a white man in the case he would have been fined $25 and the case disposed of long ago. They are making a trivial matter the excuse for a bitter factional fight.",
                "Hip Lung was seen yesterday and said that he was told that Wong Chin Foo had held a meeting of the Wong family and advised the members to raise $600 to be given to any man who would kill him, (Hip Lung), and also that Wong Chin Foo had agreed to withdraw the prosecution provided that the Moy family would pay him $500.",
                "Wong Chin Foo pronounces both of these statements false and absurd and declares that since his arrival in the city he has not been without a body guard for a moment, one of whom is a detective from Chicago Central Station. He asserts that Hip Lung or Moy Choong Few, as his correct name is, has gained his ascendency over the Chinamen of Chicago through his position as treasurer and manager of the Hip Lung company, which has houses in San Francisco and Hongkong, China. The term \"Hip Lung\" means \"united prosperity,\" he asserts and the company is owned by the Moy family.",
                "Wong Chin Foo says that he thinks that the financial power of this institution is the secret of its influence over civil courts. He says that Hip Lung himself is financially crippled through sending $8,000 a few months ago for the aid of his correspondents in Canada, who got into trouble by smuggling Chinamen into the United States. He states that the Moy family has about five hundred members in Chicago, while the Wong family numbers about fifty. Hip Lung says that his own family has two hundred representatives in the city while the Wong family has about one hundred and fifty.",
                "Wong Chin Foo is one of the best educated Chinamen in America and a writer of some repute. He is a contributor to several leading journals and is the author of an article on the drama of China, printed on page thirty-three of this issue of the Tribune."

They gave their names as Moy Yee, Moy Sam, and Moy Hong Kee, and their leader commenced operations by halting at the clerk's office and having the latter declare his intention to become a citizen. This was very simple, from the fact that when he came to this country he was over age, and was soon attended to, there being no law against any on making such a declaration. But with the others the situation was different. They had come here under 10 years of age, and bed to go to the court direct and without any preliminaries.",
                "It was something unusual to see such a procession file into the court-room, and all eyes were upon them as they presented themselves before Judge Moran and asked his attention.",
                "The wheels of justice stopped for a moment, and Foo made known his mission in tolerable English and passed to the Judge the necessary petition, as he thought to make full-fledged citizens of his companions. Such an application was new to his Honor, and, the authorities differing upon the power of the Courts to confer the rights of citizenship upon Chinamen, he scanned the paper hastily and proceeded to make the necessary examination in such cases. Foo acted as the interpreter. They testified to having come here under age, etc., and upon being asked what they thought of our institutions one responded that he liked the country better than he did China, and the other that he \"liked America's peculiarities very much\", which sent a laugh around the room.",

                "The question of the power of Courts in such cases is a constitutional one, and there have been numerous decisions both pro and con. In the United States Court of San Francisco, some time ago, it was decided that a Chinaman could not become a citizen, and prior to this, a New York, Judge had passed upon the same question and come to the same conclusion. The question is not a new one in this city, for it has arisen before, and whether Chinamen can or cannot be made citizens, the fact is that more than one of our basement laundries almond-eyed individuals armed with just as much power as any other voting individual has who came here from abroad before reaching age.",

It was sort of club, and while there was some gambling, the sums staked were very small, and the winnings were spent in the grocery for confectionary.

Imports from China amounted to 94 millions in 1934, 136 millions in 1935, 186 millions in 1936. The value in percentage of the trade with China was over 26% of all China's imports in 1934, 19% in 1935, and nearly 30% in 1936. Thus in the whole year of 1936 the total trade between the two countries was over 370 million dollars. This is a greater amount than China's trade with Japan, Great Britain or Germany.",

The principal goods that China sells to the United States are tung oil, raw silk, tea, eggs and egg products, furs and skins, bristles, tungsten, and antimony.

Over 60,000 miles were constructed in 1936. The national economic program includes the five year plan for the construction of railways, an average of 1700 kilometers a year or a total of 8,500 kilometers in all. 1936 witnessed the completion of the Canton-Hankow Railway connecting the nation from South to the North. As evidence of the great strides in railway construction, imports of railway materials increased from 65 million (American gold) dollars in 1932, 10 millions in 1934, to nearly 20 millions in 1936. Purchases were made from the United States but Great Britain was the leading supplier due to credit facilities.",

The first half of 1937 has shown a continuation of this upward trend of business welfare. In Shanghai alone, for example, electric power consumption increased 67% over 1936, yarn production 27%, flour production 13%, cement 42%, and new buildings 47%.",
                "Commerce with the United States has greatly increased during 1937 over the period of a year ago.

This will enable them to decide the steps and attitude the American government should take toward the Far-Eastern situation.",
                "There is an extremely close relationship between the United States of America and the Far-Eastern situation. American properties and rights in China are enormous. They are surpassed only by Great Britain.",
                "We can readily see why the American government should be so concerned with the Far-Eastern situation.",
                "There are a number of factors which must be considered in the course of investigation.",
                "First, the extent of damages suffered by the Unites States during the period of war between China and Japan, and the problem of protecting their property, citizens and rights in China according to the treaty.",
                "Second, the problem of \"who\" is going to be the victor of the war and\"whose victory\" will benefit United States most.",
                "Third, America was the leader of the nine power peace pact. The pact was to maintain the independent rights and integrity of China. Now that the pact has been violated by Japan, the problem is: should the United States of America do its duty as a signer of the peace pact or should it keep the pact in mind gazing with folded arms as an on-looker?",
                "As for the answer to the first problem the writer's conjecture is, let the American government protect her nations rights and the property of American citizens in China. This is merely her duty according to the treaty.",
                "But protection in times of war is not empty talk or verbal gestures. It requires \"action\". And if the United States should take such a course as \"protection\" with \"action\", then it will contradict the present war-scare psychology of the American public.",
                "Therefore, since the Sino-Japenese war, the American government has never taken a definite step. Time and again it has sent out dispatches or bulletins as to her government's position and policy, but always contradicts itself.",
                "At first the government had the intention of protecting her national rights and the property of her citizens in China with full power, in accordance with the Treaty, also to send war ships to China to exhibit its naval power. But in view of the fact that the war had already endangered the lives and properties of the American citizens, and fearing that this might lead the United States into war, Rosevelt ordered all Americans in China to leave the war-zone, or stay there at their own risk.",
                "Roosevats order was met with disapproval by the Americans in Shanghai. Secretary of State, Hull, then explained that the policy of the American government in protecting its national rights and properties, would stand as always, and the uncertainty and cowardly position taken by the government would likewise stand; thus, the first problem remains to be solved."

The Society made known the duties of women in times of war. In her public speeches Mrs. Chicang Kai-Sheik once said, \"To-day Spanish women are fighting in the front line like the men. During the world war women of all countries helped their countries in gaining an ultimate victory. I say, therefore, my fellow Chinese women, that this is our opportunity to show to the world our patriotic spirit.\" She also said, \"We as women should encourage the men, to let them know that we women have our own methods of giving them our co-operation and support. Bravery of a fighting hero in the front line depends totally on the support behind him.\"",

These are cases known to even women and children. With these famous historic cases well in mind many women have sought to duplicate their fete since the beginning of the Sino-Japanese war. Yes, the number of heroines and female martyrs are increasing as the war goes on. Indeed, they are ready to sacrifice all.",
                "Now, the oversea Chinese women - although they have not returned to China to participate in action - they certainly have encouraged the men by helping in solicitation of war fund, etc., and at the same time showing the world their patriotic spirit.",
                "The Chicago Chinese Emergency Relief Society has a squad of female solicitors. We understand they have had splendid success. Through their influence even children have turned in their candy money for contribution towards the war fund. Such is the spirit existing in the minds of our women and children. It's not now much we give but it's how we give that counts.",
                "Our Chinese women's participation in patriotic activities will not only help the government materially, but they will educate our children and instill in their minds a practically natural patriotic instinct because of their close relationships with the children. We can readily realize, now, that our future government rests on the shoulders of our women who are up-bringers of our future leaders and soldiers."

The headquarters consist of combination hotel, restaurant, mercantile office, opium berth and general jobbing buisness of which Wah-Hoe is proprietor. The weary travelers so long deprived of their peculiar and favorite dishes were soon seated at twenty tables and proceeded to devour steam rice, bamboo shoots, and birds nest soup. After a hearty breakfast the Orientals smoked opium, drank tea at intervals and occasionally gazed up and down Clark Street wonderingly.",
                "As China is opposite in all things the star actors instead of being objects of high esteem and admiration are looked upon by their fellow men as being low in the social scale. The stars are as follows: Mou Sung Tang, first tragedian; Sho Sung Ning, first villian; Shov Mon Wing, first comedian; Ton Don, leading lady impersonator; Mov Sung Jung, a giant in nature was the life and soul of the party. A number of wealthy Chinese merchants were with the party and seemed to know better what to do with themselves than did the actors. One of them purchased a lot of blue felt hats for the party as a precaution against Chicago weather. Groups of from six to twelve of the newcomers were being instructed in the value of American coins and currency by some of their brethren who have been in this country for years. As fast as the value of one piece of coin or currency was learned it was placed safely in a long stringed purse and the merits of another discussed.",

Chinese are becoming to realize if we ever want to get ahead, we must help ourselves, and if we wish to maintain the China Republic, we must fight for its existence ourselves.\"",

No doubt, citizens of all these countries will oppose such a participation, but because of the world-wide economic and other relationships of one country and another, the world will be forced to fight. Each will fight for self-defence and self-preservation.",

When the South Clark Street houses could hold no more the Chinese began drifting through the city. Laundries, restaurants, and every other sort of an establishment run by a Chinaman became a refuge.

Indeed, your neutrality stand will only help and encourage the aggressor and not the peacelike and helpless defender.",

When we accomplish this task then we have surely done our duty in maintaining the World Peace."

The entire colony sat on the sidewalks and doorsteps. They smoked long stemmed thimble sized bowled pipes or held cigarettes in their mouths. Of the larger tea merchants Sam Moy was not in. As Hip Long's place was reached a sidewalk fight started between two Chinese. Hip Long shouldered his way through the perspiring jabbering crowd of his country-men and in a fatherly way counseled peace. The belligerants were separated and the pipe and cigarette resumed sway.",
                "The reporter introduced himself to the Tea Prince who angrily waved him away with a Chinese newspaper, as one would brush aside an impetuous fly. The reporter insisted on asking as to the Exclusion Act. Hip Long demanded: \"Where you come from\"? \"The Tribune, will your people consent to sit and be photographed?\" \"Go way! I not talk\".",
                "Chow Tar was called on. The reporter was met by a servant who shrilly called out \"What you want?\" The business was explained. He disappeared, quickly re-appeared, and said \"He lie down, He not see you\". \"We get dlink\". After he had taken a long robust forget-me-not drink of common Peoria whiskey he said in clear English: \"If that law means that all my countrymen, residents in America are to be measured as criminals and labeled as so many packages of tea it will never be enforced. The ridiculousness of its provisions will kill it. Are we not residents here? Do we not pay taxes as all other property holders? It would be more nearly justice for them to drive us out. So long as we are accepted as residents we are entitled to some rights. We are not law breakers. There certainly would be a great deal of trouble should an attempt be made, such as you have indicated to place all Chinese residents on a par with professional criminals. For the record of such measurements and pictures would be classed as a \"rogues\" gallery. Would this Chinese \"rogues\" gallery be put on exhibition in the Worlds Fair to show the advancement in civilization that this nation has attained? No, no, I think that a telegram stating that such measurements and photographs are now being taken of Chinese in the cities which are ports must be a hoax. \"We take another dlink\"."

He, then, introduced the first speaker, Miss Tsuo Shuioli, a student at the University of Chicago, who spoke on \"The Commemoration of 'September 18th' and Fighting the Japanese till the End.\" She emphasized the three important methods of attacking Japan - militaristic, economic and cultural. We, who live abroad, should lead our country towards economic attack by supporting our government financially and boycotting Japanese goods, which eventually will result in a Japanese financial collapse.",
                "Mr. Hwang Kai-Lok, a student at the University of Wisconsin, then, spoke on \"Why Americans should be concerned with Sino-Japanese problems?\" Mr. Hwang stressed the fact that we should utilize every opportunity to exhortate individually, explain, and give detailed information, if necessary, on Japanese invasion of our Chinese territory. Our duty is to enable the Americans to realize that the Sino-Japanese war is not merely a Far-Eastern problem, but a problem of world peace. The domination of Asia will not appease the wild desire of imperialistic Japan but will seek the domination of Western atmosphere as well. Therefore, if America wants to avoid unnecessary sacrifices due to a possible future war with Japan, she should resent Japanese militaristic movements and sympathize with China by assisting both materially and spiritually.",
                "The evening program was concluded with the showing of films depicting Chinese civilization and the Sino-Japanese war All in all it was a grand program for a grand commemoration. Fellow countrymen who attended the meeting were not only benefited by it, but they left the auditorium with more zeal, enthusiasm, and determination than ever before."

All the shops were lit, red paper signs hung in the windows, friendly parties of Chinamen were tossing off cups of rice gin, while up-stairs, over the Hip Lung store, a Chinese orchestra was playing for the pleasure of twenty or thirty privileged Chinamen, and a policeman from the Harrison Street station.",
                "Ex-Lieut. Bowler Honored",
                "Yesterday morning was spent in preparing for the big Jollification. In the back rooms of the stores paintings of the Joss were hung over little tables on which lay the sticks of incense to be burned later in his honor. The Chicago artist's idea of the Chinese Joss resembled ex-Lieut. James Bowler of the Desplaines Street Station. It represents the Joss as a tall man with a fierce eye, a pale-cold face and a dark mustache and goatee. The walls of the shops were papered with pictures of scenes in Chinaland and pictures of the Emperor. Cigar-dealer Sam Moy's portrait of the Emperor made the big man look like a native of County Mayo. \"Who painted that picture for you Sam, my lad?\" asked Sergt. Dan Hogan of the cigar-dealer. \"Mike Casey, down here on Clark Street,\" replied Sam Moy with a grin. \"I thought so,\" remarked Sergt. Hogan. \"By my troth, the Emperor must have been too busy to give him a sitting and sent a proxy from Archer Road!\"",
                "Money in Sam's Purse",
                "Sam Moy was not offended at this criticism of his decorations. It was a pretty hardthing to offend Sam Moy, or any other Chinese merchant, yesterday. When Sam Moy arose yesterday morning his shop was crowded with customers and the customers all had their pocketbooks out. They had come to settle up their accounts with Sam Moy. On New-Year's every Chinaman must pay his \"chit\"; if he doesn't do it before 4 P.M. he is disgraced. His friends do not speak to him on the street. Chinese boys peg bricks at him. Chinese women hoot at him from the windows. When he dies he goes to a place where he will meet Americans and others. So there was a constant stream of Chinamen entering Sam Moy's all day yesterday, and Sam Moy's face wore a smile of supreme content. When a customer entered he bowed to Sam Moy and said, \"Kunghi.\" Sam Moy bowed to the customer and replied, \"Kunghi,\" which means: \"I am your everlasing servant. I humbly bow myself at your feet. I offer you my sincerest wishes for a happy year. May the moon love you. May your head mingle with the stars. May peace and prosperity be yours.\" The customer paid his bill and Sam Moy handed him a cup of gin and a five-cent cigar. Another customer came in a little while later. The same salutations were exchanged, and he, too, sat down to a cup of gin and a cigar. By nightfall the place was overcrowded. In the little stalls back of the shop half a dozen Chinamen were \"hitting the pipe,\" and in a back room fifteen or twenty were gambling. A feast was set for 6 P.M. This was the menu as at other places: Bird's Nest Soup, Shark's Fin Soup, Fried Flat Fish, Roast Chicken, Roast Pig, Roast Duck, Roast Pigeon, Rice Gin, \"Medicine\" Wine, Oranges. At 10 P.M. the diners were getting warmed up to the festivities. Rice Gin had been poured in till the little Chinaman who sat next to Sam Moy carried a load that was picturesque and beautiful to behold. The conversation took the form of dialogues. One of the Chinamen yelled across the table to another Chinaman, \"Happy New Year.\" \"Happy New Year,\" replied the other Chinaman. \"Good luck and prosperity to you.\" \"Peace and happiness to you.\" \"May you eat the skin of the roasted pig.\" \"May wealth attend your ventures.\" \"May your windows be unbroken.\" \"May your fines be suspended.\" Whenever one of the Chinamen expressed a particularly noble sentiment all the other Chinamen applauded by hammering their dishes with the cups and bowling up some more. Like many other nationalities at midnight nearly every Chinaman in Chicago was a large and ornate drunk, and the New-Year's celebration was humming.",
                "The incense sticks were burned before the pictures of ex-Lieut. Bowler, the orchestras were tuning up and the Chinamen were starting out on their calls. Each Chinaman carried two bundles of red sheets of rice paper. On each of the sheets of one bundle his name was written or engraved in Chinese characters. On each of the sheets of the other bundle a New Year's greeting was written. Every caller was treated to a bowl of gin and a cigar, the latter being carefully placed in his pocket. Before he left he handed to the host one of the red sheets. From midnight on to daylight all Chinatown was drunk and happy. The orchestre, consisting of a fiddle that plays only one note, a horn that plays another, and two drums that just make a noise, got to work about 3 P.M.",
                "The two Moy boys, who run the Hip Lung store, threw open the doors leading to the lodgings on the top floors and a great many Chinamen climbed up-stairs to pay their respects to Mrs. Quing Kee. Mrs Quing Kee is a stout German woman. She received their homage with complacency and sent Mr. Quing Kee across the street to fill the \"growler.\" \"I can't dring dot rice-chin,\" she said. \"I lige beer better. Quing go ofer by Lawler's, unt get dree pints.\"",
                "The Chinese New-Year celebration begins when the moon enters Aquarius and continues till the richest Chinamen in town thinks he has had enough. The merchants of Chicago will keep open house for ten days. The term of rejoicing grows less as the social scale is descended, and some laundrymen, who haven't much money, only keep it up for a day. The solid men of China celebrate sometimes for twenty days."

Every mail brings to the residences of the various Chinamen envelopes containing the visiting cards of their friends in New York. Philadelphia, and other Eastern points, and from places in California and elsewhere. These, together with those distributed by local callers, will be carefully hoarded until the New-Year week has passed away, when they will be posted conspicuously upon the walls to serve as an indication of the number of friends possessed by the occupant of the place.",
                "In this matter the Chinese take great pride, and the American lady whose door is besieged with callers from early in the morning until late at night on January 1st.,is not more an object of envy or admiration in her own set than is the Mongolian whose mementoes of similar attention palpably out-number the collections made by his fellow-countrymen."

                "The achievements of the Chinese students in this country are well known to us all. During the last 30 years. Chinese student movements have met with appropriate success and development. In spite of changing circumstances and conditions the student movement nevertheless, must continue to progress, because the general principles and aims of the student organizations remain the same. One must, however, remember to adopt proper methods and procedures in organizing and take into consideration the present environment and circumstances.",
                "I realize that all you student delegates are here to discuss the exact duties and proper activities of students under the conditions concerning national welfare. And I will now present my version of the present conditions.",
                "1. You undoubtedly realize that we are living in the most precarious and critical stage of our national history. All of us must share in the responsibility of averting the calamities of the national crisis. You, students, are the intellectual nucleus of whatever movements we might undertake.",
                "You are fortunately blessed with wisdom and the ability to understand the republican principles of China. Therefore, students who respect and honor the past achievements of our student movements will surely follow their example in rendering their service to our country.",
                "2. We are fighting, in the present war, for freedom and independence. We must win the war at any cost. If, however, we who are citizens of one of the world's largest and most resourceful countries having the oldest historical background and civilization, should be unfortunate enough to lose in the end, not only we would suffer the consequence but it would also be a loss to the world. I therefore, repeat that we must secure the ultimate victory. And in order to reach such a goal we need an unparalleled determination in working whole-heartedly for such an accomplishment.",
                "3. We all realize that the present war is going to be a protracted one and we must plan and prepare accordingly. The following are important factors in the extended war against our invader.",
                "(a) Military organization - Our military forces have gradually discarded old fashioned equipment and are using modern machinery and equipment. If we should plan to prolong the war over a five year period, we must consider the replacement and manufacturing of arms despite our ever available man-power.",
                "(b) Aerial Combat - We realize that aerial combat is most predominant in modern warfare. Our enemies are using bombers to endanger our defenses, and it is up to us to defend ourselves aerially. We are, therefore, facing the vital problem of purchasing planes and training pilots. We, citizens of China, not only should be generous in contributing towards the up-building of aerial defense but we must also have more intelligent young men to take up aviation courses. We must prepare ourselves to become useful and available to our national government.",
                "(c) The need of talented and trained scientists- Because of lack of trained scientists, we have depended somewhat upon foreign specialists I am sorry to say. We realize that in times of war we need more scientifically trained men and women. I hope that those who have specialized in science will soon go back to serve our country.",
                "(d) The need of spirit in war- The outcome of a war, whether it be victory or defeat, depends also upon the morale and the spirit of the participants. While our country is resisting our enemy with united effort, you students should likewise unite in spirit in your patriotic activities.",
                "(e) Exhortation and publicity work- In this Sino-Japanese War, we are trying to resist our invaders; we are fighting for freedom and independence; we are fighting for our national principles; and lastly, we are fighting for world peace. Our principles and actions are right and, therefore, it's not difficult to gain sympathy from the rest of the world. You students should utilize every available opportunity to elucidate our purposes in the war, and to explain how both the United States and Europe will, eventually, be involved in the present war.",
                "Personally, I am proud of our national heroes and their achievements, I am very optimistic regarding our ultimate victory. Above all, during these critical times of our national crisis you students should not neglect your duty as citizens. Everyone should take an active part in patriotic endeavors."

It was a harmless booking proposition on its face, but the Government authorities at this port filed a prompt objection.",

It is a Herculean task to keep them out.",

Yesterday a man who has traveled in the East said: \"Why doesn't the government require each Chinaman to make the imprint of his thumb upon his papers on leaving the country? It would be a sure means of identification, because the lines on no two human being's thumbs are alike. It is a method used in the Orient."

It is difficult to see in what manner that purpose would be to any extent defeated or hindered by permitting Chinese citizens under proper regulations to visit the United States in 1893 for the purpose of taking part in the Columbian Exposition, in which the Chinese Government has been formerly asked by the Government of the United States to participate.

Those who are not quite familiar with this phase of baneful influence from which the world is suffering today, will do well to examine the illegal actions of Japan in China. In recent years, the world has come to openly question the good faith of Japanese pretentions regarding China. Time and again, responsible Japanese officials told the world that Japan has no territorial designs in China, but their actions in China belie their words.",
                "Steadfastly and incessantly Japan has encroached upon the administrative and territorial sovereignty of China. In less than six years, she has occupied four large provinces of China in addition to certain parts of the provinces of Suiyuan and Chahar, generally known as Eastern Mongolia. It is characteristic of Japanese aggressions in China, that \"incidents\" are purposely created, and under such pretenses armed force is invariably resorted to. When the smoke clears after each conflict, we find Japan occupying more Chinese territories, and more firmly entrenched in positions, which enables her to infringe further upon China's rights.",
                "In regard to the military occupation by Japan of the north-eastern provinces of China since 1931 and the fighting in Shanghai in 1932, the legal aspects are very clear. The impartial commissions appointed by the League of Nations, clearly stated that Japan acted in Manchuria and at Shanghai without any justification and in violation of the covenant of the League, of the Kellogg Peace Pact and of the Nine-Power Treaty of Washington.",

Her object is to set up therein another regime upon the pattern of the puppet state \"Man-chukuo\". There is no limit to the ambitions of Japan. According to her fixed policy, generally known as the Continental Policy, Japan will extend her domination not only over China, but also over the whole of Asia.",
                "To realize their domination over North China, the Japanese militarists purposely created on July 7th, the \"incident\" at Lukuochiao, or Marco Polo Bridge, where Japan has no right to station troops and hold maneuvers. Since then the Japanese forces have been in control of the whole Peiping - Tientsin area, from which emanate terrific attacks on Chinese positions.",
                "The fighting that is raging in Shanghai is not a mere local event. It is a tactical measure purposely employed by Japan to consummate another conquest. The fact that Shanghai is the chief economic and financial center of China and an international city where foreign commerce and investments abound, is too well known to require elaboration.",
                "And that is the reason why Japan has chosen such a place as an object of her vandalism. While China is compelled to make supreme sacrifices for the preservation of her national existence, it is tragic indeed that innocent lives and properties have to suffer in atonement for the sins of Japanese militarism.",
                "The cause of the present hostilities in China is very apparent. It is actuated by two diametrically opposite motives - on the part of Japan it is an undeclared war for national aggrandizement and territorial expansion. While for China it is armed resistence for the preservation of her national existence and independence. The whole issue, however multifarious and complicated, can be correctly called \"Jingoism versus national self-determination.\"",
                "Resistance is the only course opened to us. China has exhausted every effort for a peaceful settlement with Japan. Indeed, our government has made it known to Japan as well as to the world that it is prepared to settle any or all of the differences with Japan by any of the pacific procedures known to international law and practice.",
                "But such suggestions have received no response from the Japanese government. In spite of our conciliatory attitude and utmost patience, Japan repeatedly has resorted to force to seize Chinese territories. Our government wishes it to be known that the provocations and aggressions of Japan have forced China to offer armed resistance to the best of her ability since all attempts on her part at conciliation have proved unsuccessful.",
                "It should be understood that China, while resisting the Japanese aggressions primarily on her own account, is also upholding at the same time, the sanctity of the international treaties, such as the Covenent of the League of Nations, the Kellogg Peace Pact and the Nine - Power Treaty of Washington. While China does not expect the friendly nations to start a crusade in her behalf she expects that all signatory powers to these pacts should feel conscious of their obligations under them.",
                "Lastly, we must, however, express our deep appreciation for the moral support and the keen sense of justice of the American people, although we must all understand that some concrete actions are indispensable to crystallize this moral force so that it may hasten the advent of peace in the Far East."

The aeronautic school air field has always been inspected by visitors, but the military air field is kept closed to the public. As a matter of fact, the public does not even know that there is such a field for military activities. In times of war, the well known aeronautic school moves into the interior, and leaves behind the hangars and some 50 wooden decoy planes. It was not long before our enemy's planes flew above the field and destroyed the planes which they thought were real ones. While they were fully enjoying themselves in destroying the wooden planes, our aerial fighters surrounded them with machine guns. As a result of this combat our enemy fled minus 5 planes. We lost only one plane which was indeed a victory."

The whole country is determined and ready to make unlimited sacrifices. Furthermore, prominent citizens and leaders all over the country are co-operating splendidly in finance, transportation, and defense matters as well as in spirit.",
                "The rapid unification of our country for defensive purposes is indeed a surprise to the Japanese, who consider it as a really perplexing problem. Because of the existing situation, the Japanese have used their concentrated efforts in their invasion of our country. But in spite of their lawlessness and brutal tactics used in their attack, our country as a whole is united as strongly as ever. The long looked-for sacrifices were not a surprise to us. We are all prepared for it, and the longer the war lasts the stronger our country will be. While our enemy is not in the position to maintain a prolonged war, and if she should be forced to prolong her attack, then, a Japanese internal shake-up is inevitable. Then,and only then, will we reap the final victory.",
                "Our government, therefore, is looking forward to a continuous financial support of a prolonged war from the overseas Chinese, and a genuine sacrifice from all those who are in action."

Chee, owner of a laundry at 6239 Broadway, refused to contribute, and to make matters worse, he even indulged in uncalled-for verbal arguments with the solicitors, which exasperated all who heard of the incident.",
                "However, H. S. Chee came to realize, shortly afterward, that it was rather a serious matter to exasperate the public. So he asked Mr. C. C. Chao, a Chinatown merchant, to convey his apology to the Chinese Emergency Relief Society - saying, that he was untactful and careless in his conversation with the solicitors, for which he apologizes wholeheartedly. He pleaded for forgiveness from the officers of the Society and promised a contribution of $100. Mr. H. Moy, general director of the Society, realizing that is was purely ignorance on the part of Chee, and with Mr. C. C. Chao's sincereness in entreatment on behalf of Chee, he accepted the apology. It was then, and then only, that the public feeling calmed.",

All moral effort since the human race has existed would be annihilated, a and there would be no distinction between men and beasts. Cruelty and brutality would rule the world.

                "During General Chiang Kai Shek's brief visit in Canton he spoke at the Hwang-Poo Military Academy and met unofficially all the leading educators of Kwantung and expressed his opinion regarding education and its system in Kwantung.",
                "Those who were present including: President T. Y. Tung, of Tsung San University who is also the Dean of Agricultural Department; Dean C. Fang of the Department of Literature; Dean Y. Y. Hoe of the Science Department; Dean C. H. Lin of the Industrial Department; Dean T. S. Lin of the Medical Department; and General Secretary C. J. Chio of the same University; President Y. K. Tsung of the Ling-Nang University and Dean S. C. Yang of the Department of Literature; President C. T. Ching of the Canton University; and President P.M. Wu of the People's University.",
                "It was during an informal tea reception in the garden of the Hwang-Poo Military Academy campus when General Chiang commenced to express his deep concern in education. He spoke of hope and future in education. He emphasized that a revolutionized political future and society depends solely upon systemized education. Education makes a citizen and educated citizens are ever qualified for important duties in society and its national government.",
                "During his recent tour of China, General Chiang has spoken to all the leading educators in every province (state) in China pleading for an improved educational system whereby more youths may obtain training which is absolutely essential to a good citizen. Indeed, it takes a good citizen to serve society and humanity. If our citizens are more concerned with their responsibilities, a bright future and satisfactory consequences will be apparent.",
                "General Chiang then spoke of Canton. Whether it is political, economic or educational revolution he hopes that Canton or the State of Kwantung will be a model State in China. He pleaded earnestly, therefore, that all Cantonese educators will endeavor to promote a wholesome educational system, so that the youths may grow with a wholesome education as their foundation.",
                "\"A wholesome education\" emphasized General Chiang, \"consists of moral, intellectual, physical and social trainings. Every educator and teacher must feel responsible for the growth of this four-fold training in their students.\"",
                "\"In the process of such a four-fold training, discipline is very essential.\" By this, General Chiang stressed \"that all students must be taught the disciplinary life - they must be taught to realize that there is a limit, beyond which there is ill - consequence thus gradually building in them the habit of lawfulness and the ever - increasing spirit of patriotism.",
                "If a teacher is successful in bringing his student up to this stage then the way is paved for the building of a new generation with proper individual qualification and integrity - a foundation which is necessary to a ranking nation.\"",
                "\"But before an educator is able to bring up his students systematically and successfully he must first discipline himself - his thoughts, words, actions and habits. He must visualize the indispensible quality that makes a good citizen. He must be a model to his students.\" To prove how extremely importantoa teacher is to a nation, Ceneral Chiang stated, \"good educators produce good citizens; good citizens produce good society and government - eventually a modern strong nation.\"",
                "So then, the future of our country is really in the hands of our teachers and students. All of us - fellow countrymen - who are abroad have no doubt contributed financially to some or all of our national activities - mostly political in nature, because we feel that this is the only means with which to express the spirit of patriotism and duty. But little do we realize that the far more effective way to serve our country is to center our attention upon our children's educational trainings - in bringing up the future pillars of our national government. Let us all bear in mind our great leader General Chiang's speech and shall we not be more concerned with all our educational activities here in the Chicago community?"

                "The problem of democracy is a problem of education. Experience has shown that true democracy and illiteracy do not go together. They are like ice and fire. True democracy must be built on intelligent citizenship, a thing not possible in our homeland where only twenty percent of the population can read and write. Since 1911 the thinking class, which embodies the twenty percent, has tried desperately to make the populace literate but has failed to achieve much. It is our conviction that the lot of the common people cannot be bettered until they are able to read and write. From the standpoint of national progress it is impossible to develop a country without the strength of an enlightened people, and the further enliightenment is spread in any land the greater is the progress of that people.",
                "Unless we make the masses literate through a revolutionized educational system, our country will continue to be exploited by militarists from within and imperialists from without.",
                "The main factor responsible for the high percentage of illiteracy in our country has been, undoubtedly, the difficulty of learning the Chinese written language, which is altogether different from the spoken language. It has been taught for centuries as the only literary medium, though to attain a proficient knowledge of it would require almost a life time. The call for a reform of the written language is therefore of the utmost importance, if one fourth of the world's population is to be made safe for democracy and prove a blessing to mankind.",
                "Fortunately a literary revolution took place in 1919, which was the simplification of the process of learning to read and write, providing the people with a more simplified tool for expression called \"Pei-Hwa,\" which combines the written and spoken languages, and thus reducing the problem of illiteracy.",
                "One far reaching effect of the adoption of Pei-Hwa is the replacement of all old literary writings in the text books of elementary schools by writings in the conversational style. A national convention of the teachers from the government normal schools petitioned, a few years later, the teaching of Pei-Hwa in the elementary schools in place of the classical language. Accordingly, the following proclamation was issued:",
                "\"We have received from the convention of the National Educational Association their decision to promote a national language, in order that the spoken and written languages may become one. Moreover, they asked the Ministry of Education to take this matter into consideration and give effect to their decision. A further recommendation has been received by us from the Organizing Committee for the unification of the National Language, urging the consideration and prompt change of the present Classical Department to National Language Department etc.",
                "\"We recognize that because of the difference between our classical and spoken languages, education in the schools makes slow progress and the keen edge of the spirit of union both between individuals and in society at large has thereby been blunted. Moreover, if we do not take prompt steps to make the spoken and written languages the same, any plans for developing our civilization will surely fail.",
                "\"This Ministry of Education has for several years made positive advances in promoting such a national language. All educators, moreover, throughout the country are in favor of a change, by which the teaching of the national spoken language shall take the place of the classical language. Inasmuch, therefore, as all desire to promote education in the national language, we deem it wise not to delay the matter any longer.",
                "\"We, therefore, now order that beginning in the primary schools, all shall be taught the national spoken language rather than the national classical language. Thus the spoken and written languages will become one. This Ministry requests all officials to take notice and act accordingly, and requires all schools under their jurisdiction to respect this order and carry it into effect.\"",
                "The above is an old order from our Ministry of Education but how many of us have responded to the order? No doubt, we are living here in an educationally systemized country where the need of hard - pressing educational revolution of our homeland is hardly felt directly, but we as citizens of China should realize that every one of us is responsible for our national progress, especially fundamental education.",
                "Our educational movement of today differs from the United States - in that the American Educational Movement is entirely a governmental affair whereas ours is a people's movement, though local officials do come in to assist. Lately the educational movement is even pushed in the army by men like Gen. Chiang Kai-Shek, etc. who have come to realize the importance of army education.",
                "The result is immensely gratifying. Not only have many of the illiterate soldiers learned to read and write, but the morale in the army is also fostered. Yes indeed, better education makes a better citizen and a better citizen makes a better nation.",
                "The significance of the Mass Educational Movement was characterized by one of our foremost educators, Mr. James Yen, in the following statement: \"Reading has been traditionally looked upon by the people as a specialty to be pursued exclusively by the scholar. There has been in reality what is called the'aristocracy of learning.' The Mass Educational Movement, in championing the cause of 'education for all,' and in working systematically and persistently to bring education within the reach of all, bids fair to revolutionize the thought life of the masses.",
                "\"It is a movement by the people. The promotion of the campaign and the teaching and supervision of the schools are done voluntarily by businessmen, gentry, teachers and students of the schools and colleges. The campaign fund is contributed by the well-to-do members of the community. One of the inevitable results is the boosting of education wherever it goes. On the one hand it arouses the public sentiment of the leaders for general educational reform, and on the other hand, it creates a desire on the part of rank and file for more adequate education.",
                "\"The Mass Educational program provides favorable conditions for united effort where no material gain is possible and where unselfish service is demanded. Furthermore, by participating in this program the well-to-do and the educated come to the realization that the welfare of the community depends upon the development and the intelligence of the masses.",
                "In the meantime, as the illiterate themselves are given the opportunity for self development, it creates in them a sense of personal worth as well as a sense of responsibility in the life of the community and the nation.\"",
                "How true it is, that the future of any national government is totally dependent upon the educational progress of the nation. While the need for constructive efforts is felt on all hands by our national government, the nationalization of education to curb illiteracy is by far the most urgent, and calls for the support of all of us who have the welfare of our fellow countrymen and national government at heart.",
                "Let us all begin right from where we are, in this little community, to promote more educational activities - not particularly for ourselves as most of us perhaps feel that we are beyond the learning age, but for the benefit of our children who will shoulder the heavy responsibility of our national future."

                "According to history the ancient Chinese, like the inhabitants of most Eastern countries, wore long hair, but Tartar conquerors, though allowing them to retain their laws and religion, compelled then to shave the head and face as a badge of servitude, allowing no man under 40 years of age to grow either a beard or mustache, a small tuft of hair at the crown of the head being all that was permitted to flourish. However the feelings of the Tartars were so respectful to the dead that they never extended this order to a house of mourning. Time eventually healed the sorrow and humiliation wrought by this despotic edict, so that finally the custom was adopted by the entire Chinese Empire, and now its origin is nearly obliterated. Thousands of barbers perambulate the streets in China, twanging a pair of long iron tweezers to indicate that they are at leisure.",
                "In Canton alone there are more than 8,000 of these wanderers who are all under the strictest surveillance, a severe penalty being inflicted to any one who practices the art without license. But here in Chicago it is quite different.",
                "THEY SHAVE ON SUNDAY",
                "A Tribune reporter learned from a laundryman that Sunday was the day they shave, and accordingly he set out last Sunday for the laundry in the basement of No. 315 South Clark Street. It was about 10 o'clock in the morning when he reached the place, and quite a number of Mongolians were collected round a table smoking pipes that savored of onions. The reporter, after saluting the proprietor of the establishment, seated himself at the stove, and about a half hour after,the door was opened and another Chinaman entered, carrying a curiously shaped box under his arm, which he deposited in a back room. Presently he reappeared with his hat and coat removed and his sleeves rolled up, apparently ready for business. Shortly after,he reentered the room accompanied by one of the smokers. The reporter followed.",
                "First the barber beat the body of the \"patient\" with his hands (the same as in the \"movement cure\"). Then the arms and legs were stretched by violent jerks, giving the reporter the impression that they were being dislocated, and finally the barber pulled the man's arms and pushed his head in the opposite direction, making the latter grunt. Then the \"patient's\" fingers were cracked, and after a repetition of the \"movement cure\", the instruments, which are made of slip horn, were brought into use. The earspoon preceded a syringe, which was followed by several small instruments being turned about, one after another, under the eye-lids, which of course made the tears flow freely. Then the face was gone over with a pair of tweezers, with which any straggling hairs that might have been overlooked during the shaving were pulled out.",
                "The performance did not last more than half an hour, and was brought to a close by the \"patient's\" toe and finger nails being pared. Although a great many Chinamen shave their own faces there are eighty-three barbers in Chicago who are making more money than than average laundryman, and who work only on Sunday."

One man, a clever merchant, said that the cause of the dark space on the Sun was because the Moon was behind it. He tried hard to make the reporter comprehend this theory for some time, and than suddenly seized a piece of smoked glass from a friend's hand and said: \"Alle same this, no smokee, see through; smokee, no see through. Sabe?\" After considerable study of the object, and further smoked glass demonstration, the reporter was made to understand that in the Chinaman's opinion the Sun is a hole through which a glowing light shines down upon the world and that at that time the Moon had slid in behind the Sun in some irregular manner and this obscured a portion of the light by blocking up a portion of the hole.",
                "The Chinese listeners to this explanation all grunted their assent, and the reporter moved on to approach a group of lower and more ignorant Chinese.",
                "Here, for a wonder, the Chinamen were found with their eyes wide open. This proved that the eclipse was a matter of stupendous wonder for them. One Chinaman then explained that the Sun and Moon were having a quarrel, and the evident conclusion was that the Sun had got the worst of it and came off with a black eye.",
                "The reporter carried a small piece of smoked glass with him. One amazed Chinaman looked hard and long at the reporter's use of the glass, and then asked to have it. He was given it, and after viewing the Sun with it a moment, delightedly passed ot to a friend who clapped it to his eye, with the smoked side toward him."
