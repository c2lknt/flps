                "It started in Italy. Bloody clashes, beastly face-slapping, window-smashing, conflagrations, robberies and other hideous acts, blazoned its advent. This raging upheaval kept up, to the consternation of the shuddering Italian people, and to the exasperation of people in other countries with any degree of culture.",

                "The capitalists and reactionaries of Italy contributed enormous fortunes to the victorious criminal fascist activities. They provided quarters, armament, gave weapons and money. Their papers were filled with praise and glory for the national \"heroes,\" The Italian government practically did not resist their fiendish attacks on workingmen, practically did not oppose those gangs and their leaders, and the Fascists became an invincible force, so invincible that when they marched on Rome the government willingly transferred to them the right of ruling the land. The king of Italy, a weakling void of personality, silently reconciled himself to this, and now Italy is run by the Fascists; by mad reactionaries, by those who hate the working class, hate freedom of expression, freedom of thought, or of sensible, useful reform.",
                "Power will always attract us. The majority of people will bow before power of any type. As soon as the Fascists of Italy usurped power in that country, their success at once attracted the attention of capitalists, reactionaries, monarchists and all other types of obscurantists in other countries.",
                "Back to life came the dark forces of Germany, Hungary, Rumania, and Jugoslavia, whose foundation had slipped from under them only a little while ago. The cast-off chieftains in these lands, the consorts of Wilhelm, Hindenburg, Carlo, Horthy, Alexander, King of Serbia, and the bloody king of Rumania, began to stir again. All the dark forces from everywhere began to live again. They saw new roads for the strengthening of their waning power, for their getting back to autocratic rule over exhausted, oppressed peoples, and these henchmen started to organize fascist gangs of their own. Fascists began to appear also in Saxony, Bavaria, Hungary, Rumania, Jugoslavia, and even in Poland, too. It is said that they are beginning to appear also in Mexico.",
                "Their slogan is the same everywhere: It is to combat workingmen's organizations; to strengthen militarism and extreme nationalism; to increase the territory of their country at the expense of other countries; to retain to the utmost the order of despotism and of tyranny. They are for the enslavement of peasants and factory workers by landowners and employers, and they stand also for all the autocratic laws of an iron despotism and oppression.",
                "Fascism is the invention of capitalists as a last weapon against the workingmen of the world, who, of late, have been fighting desperately for the amelioration of their lot. Fascism is the last attempt of capitalists, aristocrats, reactionaries, and all the other black leaders of the world, to return their countries to the old order of capitalistic, militaristic, and reactionary autocracy. Fascism is striving toward the complete mastery over peasants and workers.",
                "Fascism came to destroy all that which the workingmen and the peasants have gained for themselves in the last years. Fascism came close on the trail of the workers' struggle, the world over, through many years, for a better future. After victorious revolutions, after the whole world had been gripped by strikes, after tempestuous protests against war, and after a prolonged struggle for a better deal for the masses, came fascism. It came at a time when the masses, exhausted from a protracted struggle, were temporarily apathetic. It came at a time of momentary stupor, and, supported by cannon, swords, guns, and capital. Whereas the working class has been temporarily overcome,fascism was victorious. Its beastly force is the cause of its victory.",
                "Yet all those who have eyes to see and ears to hear must not fall before this pitiable, temporarily victorious movement. It is the artificial breed of reaction. It is a wind-driven cloud, which appears on the eve of light. If only you will recall that movements of this type have always appeared, everywhere, on the eve of liberation. So it was in the far past, and so it was in the recent past.",
                "The black hundred in Russia had raged with exceptional vindictiveness on the eve of the 1915 manifesto, and again on the eve of the 1917 revolution. The reaction in Germany, Austria, Bulgaria and other countries was raging with greater ferocity than ever just before the militarists and other black hundreds in those countries were blipped on the head.",
                "Let the Italian fascists go on with their fury. The more furious (they are) the sooner they will be kicked off their temporary thrones.",
                "The same fate is awaiting the fascists of other countries. Just let the workingmen and peasants catch their breath and the fascists will quickly disappear, and fascism will evaporate.",

                "The Grand Venerable, Chevalier George J. Spatuzza, having performed well and thoroughly the fundamental duty of assuring to the Order its financial stability, conceived the idea of the banquet and submitted it to the approval of the Grand Council at its meeting last February 24.",
                "By it, in an unmistakable way, he gave expression to the high cconception in which he holds the Order and for which he has coined a slogan: \"The duties are reserved for the members. The benefits are extended to all the Italian community\".",
                "In prospecting his idea the Grand Venerable added: \"It is my earnest desire that the day to be fixed for the banquet should coincide with the epoch-making one of the discovery of America: With that memorable day, which for us Italians is an inexhaustible source of pride, and for the rest of the valuable benefits that have been reaped from the inspired act of this, our great Italian genius. It will be our privilege and our cherished wish to affirm on that occasion, in the most solemn and befitting manner, that the solidarity of our race, cemented by adversities and triumphs, remains still unchanged as it has been unchangeable throughout the centuries.",
                "And we wish to assert it on that day when, in the simplicity of his soul, the immigrant, recalling the memory of the greatest explorer of all times, through him perceives the numberless glories that are ours, and that no hostile and base propaganda can efface or contaminate.",
                "And while the immigrant rejoices, hopes and prays that his Italy may always achieve everlasting glory, we, who have espoused his cause, will initiate with a symbolic send-off, his son or daughter into the social and political life of the country.",
                "We also mean by this noble gesture inspired by a disinterested principle of brotherhood, to confer deserved value on that conspicuous contribution of Latin intelligence and initiative, that the offspring of the immigrant is ready to offer to this land so dear to us, because it is the land of Columbus, Vespecci, Verrazzano, Toriti, Vigo, Meucci, and many others, who are too numerous to be mentioned. The suggestion was unanimously approved by the Grand Council which resolved to accept also, in that connection, another important suggestion made by the Grand Venerable which completes and enhances the previous one. It was resolved that on that occasion funds be raised for the endowment of one or more scholarships to be assigned to those students of Italian birth or extraction, who during the year have obtained the best average in their study at any high school of the state.",
                "Of its own initiative and with the purpose of encouraging the study of the Italian language in our schools, the Grand Council also approved the conferring of prizes, (the nature of which is to be determined), to those boys or girls irrespective of their nationality, who have, during the year, obtained the best average in the study of Italian."

                "Working laboriously and enthusiastically, in the latter part of May, 1929, a group of four students - Emilio Amelotti, John Nicolosi, Tom Sinicalshi, and John Granata - met and discussed the possibility of an organization to be composed of students of Italian descent at the University of Illinois in Urbana. The idea was discussed by the small assemblage with earnest and fervent enthusiasm. As a result of the proceedings a club, which was given the name \"Silvio Pellico,\" in remembrance of the immortal martyr, statesman, and patriot, was organized. The termination of the school year temporarily delayed further activity at the University.",
                "However, the members of the organization were far from being dormant after leaving the campus for their respective homes, but on the contrary, undertook with the greatest enthusiasm the work where they had left it. They were all from the same city, Chicago. This advantage in being able to work collectively, rather than individually, insured the success of the organization for the following year and years to come. Prospective University students were pledged. Although the organization was a club, it was operated on a fraternity basis. The accomplishments of these individuals, during the summer vacation, was manifested by the innumerable successful activities which took place at the opening of school in the fall, September, 1929. At the beginning of the fall term the Pellico Club's functions were well under way. Meals were served, and all fraternal functions were carried out.",
                "It was during its infancy that the club secured the incessant, sincere, and profound cooperation of the prominent merchants and civic leaders of Chicago.",
                "A banquet was given in their honor and many prominent professional Italians were present. It was these men who inspired the members to carry on their task diligently.",
                "After carrying on as a club for a period of a year and a half, a petition to secure permission to function as a fraternity was filed with the council of the administration. It was always the objective of the club to be recognized as a fraternity.",
                "The petition was granted on January 2, 1931, and the charter members were: D. Salamone, W. J. Eovaldi, E. Maccono, G. Aimone, A. Santi, D. Vespa, and S. Vitello. The officers are: E. Maccono, president; W. J. Eovaldi, vice-president; S. Vitello, Secretary; A. Santi, treasurer; and G. Aimone, historian; all of whom will carry on with ardent enthusiasm the work of the organization next semester. The fraternity is local in charter, at present, but its members are making plans to become affiliated with a national organization. \"Delta Phi Alpha\" has successfully competed with long established fraternities on the campus, in scholastic, athletic, and social activities. Scholastically, it has attained the highest standing of all the ninety fraternities on the campus, for the last semester. A telegram that commended highly the fraternity for its high and scholastic attainment and stated at the same time that it hoped that such a record would be perpetuated, was received from the Supreme Council of the Italo-American National Union.",
                "Among the members and other students, participation in activities sponsored by the University is encouraged. Fair play is encouraged and the meaning of fraternity is taught.",
                "During its short existence \"Delta Phi Alpha\" has had the honor of having three prominent members who are highly esteemed and respected among their citizenry. They are: John Granata, attorney-at-law from Chicago, brother of Congressman Peter Granata; Emil Amelotti, professor of mathematics and physics at the University of Illinois and adviser to the fraternity; and D. Vespa, attorney-at-law, Toluca, who graduated with high honors."

                "When the Italian Christian Institute was carrying on its mission and institutional work at 567 W. Taylor St., a Sunday class of girls of about sixteen years of age, from the Lagrange Presbyterian Church, went in for a short time on Saturday mornings to help in the sewing classes. My only daughter was one of these. Just on the verge of her eighteenth birthday she passed away. I felt that I should seek in some way to occupy my thoughts to make life worth living, and so found myself wandering to the place she had talked of and to which she had given a small part of her time.",
                "After feeling around as to where I was most needed and being told by one of the kindergarten teachers that volunteer help was not very successful because it couldn't be depended on, my interest turned to the Woman's Auxiliary which was then new and small. It was an active group, however, and furnished great assistance and inspiration to the institute workers.",
                "As that neighborhood changed from a residential district to a factory district, the people moving west, there was a period of unrest and inactivity for the auxiliary. A few held together, however, until a larger field was opened to them at 1200 W. Taylor St., and the first task was to get back the old members and to interest the new members.",
                "As president of the auxiliary I found ample work to occupy my thoughts and time. We stood ready to back the institute staff in many ways, such as furnishing living quarters, collecting equipment for the institute gymnasium, library, club rooms, kitchen, etc., and raising funds to be used towards our work and neighborhood relief. After five years of this work I began \"volunteer service\" among the girls of twelve and fourteen years of age, in spite of my lack of encouragement along those lines a few years before! The management evidently felt I could \"be depended on.\"",
                "I worked with the girls in their sewing classes and in their scout work, and then with the mothers in their club, calling on them at their homes, and occasionally visiting the other departments, i. e., the kindergarten, church, and Sunday school. Also having seen works of handicraft completed by both boys and girls, and having noticed great changes, for the better, in the character, living and outlook, among the women and children who have attended the institute for some time, I feel that I am in a position to realize what a splendid and far-reaching influence Garibalid Institute has over the individuals who participate in the activities. It is three-fold in its benefit. First, to the people it is giving service, second, to these who serve it, third, to Chicago and the world, by turning out better citizens.",
                "Anderson, \"What Garibaldi Institute ...., \"Vita Nuova, October 1919.",
                "I have real friends among the members of the Mothers' Club. For several years I interested myself in the activities of the Mothers' Club and am thankful that I began at the Italian Christian Institute when I did, for this institute has greatly developed me, and I am sure if I had waited, as so many did and not joined when I did, I would have missed a great joy in life.",

You perhaps felt that the time and effort spent in that study could have been better employed in acquiring knowledge of more practical value.",

This shows not only that an active trade exists between the two nations but that this commerce is always increasing.",

Of greater importance yet is the domestic commerce in the Italo-American communities of the United States. We do not have any statistical data on this commerce, but, considering that in the United States there are more than four million Italians, many of whom can speak or read only Italian, it is logical to conclude that it is necessary to know the language in order to do any business with the large mass of Italo-Americans. And that reason applies in a special way, to the professional field.",

                "Italy's contributions to the world in the field of arts, and scientific discoveries and culture, and inventions, is unsurpassed. The beauty of the Italian language, which is free of hard sounds, and is very easy to pronounce and read, is universally recognized. Therefore, we can affirm, without any doubt, that the student who is interested in culture and the arts should select, above all others, the Italian language. For, besides being the key to a vast and important culture, to a rich fund of literature, and to a school of art and music which is a lasting glory to Italian genius, the Italian language has notable scientific merits and has the distinction of being the simplest, sweetest, and most harmonious of all languages.",
                "In studying Italian, students of Italian descent would have the opportunity to understand and appreciate the enormous contribution of their race to the civilization of the world. Then they will not feel ashamed, but will be proud of being Italians.",
                "They will place themselves in a position to impart to their American colleagues the heritage that Italy has and always will have.",
                "It is only in such a way, and on that basis, that the Americanization of the younger generation can be accomplished.",

                "Thus, it is necessary for our students to enroll in the courses of Italian. In doing so, they will acquire a knowledge that can be of advantage to them, they will make Italy and the Italians better known to the great American people, and they will strengthen still more the friendship which already binds the two nations."

                "According to the latest statistics, so he said, Chicago contained 43,280 Italian minors, of which more than 5,000 were born in Italy and 3,700 were born in America of Italian parents. As the figures indicate, the third generation of Italian-Americans are not included and that number would run the total to about 50,000. The problem was to find a way in which to preserve for the future descendants of this group the best that is to be found in Italian literature and culture by teaching the language, and in this way make effective the program of the National Dante Alighieri Club. It means fighting for the right of having Italian taught in the public schools, the same as German, this to be accomplished by a seriously planned program in which the entire Colony actively participated. Not of less interest and perhaps more urgent is the problem of organizing an effective charitable group for the relief of the less fortunate in the Colony. The burden of this has been to some extent borne by the Italian Women's Social Welfare Society and to a lesser degree by the Maria Adelaide Society. But their methods are antiquated and funds collected hardly make a dent on the problem.",
                "The Jews with a population equal to ours are in this respect the best organizers. They subscribe annually to a fund amounting to $500,000. Seventy-eight individuals contribute sums varying from $1,000 to $25,000 each year. This enormous sum is spent on the Michael Reese Hospital which receives about$100,000, orphan asylums, scientific research institutes, homes for the aged, and the T. B. Sanitariums in Colorado. The Italian Colony does not boast as yet of multi-millionaires as is the case with the Jewish group in Chicago, but it does have many wealthy owners of real estate, and prosperous professional and business men. What a field for the philanthropist, to join with that small group of women, who at the present are directing the only existing social welfare activities in the Colony, and help in this noble work of relieving the suffering of the less fortunate in our Colony."

If possible the Board of Education Committee would like to receive a large number of Italians with ready suggestions on how necessary the teaching of a foreign language is. Form a committee and transmit a copy of your suggestions to the Superintendent of the Board of Education, on important facts of the teaching of the Italian language in the Elementary Schools.",

The teaching of their native language is necessary in the Elementary Schools as well as in the High Schools, so that students will not forget their parent's language and will have the advantage of knowing more than one language. Every one in this city is forced to pay taxes, therefore, they should all enjoy equal opportunities. The advantage we are now looking forward to is the teaching of foreign languages. Mr. Walleck also thinks that it is our duty to take advantage of the privileges given us.",
                "The Board of Education is ready to spend any sum of money for an education, but only on condition that the people enjoy such an education as the teaching of the foreign language. Mr. Walleck gave us a list of names and addresses to whom to write for such information. They are as follows: Daniel R. Cameron, 73 Lake St. - Mrs. Caroline K. Sherman, 1538 Monroe St. - Bernard F. Rogers, 154 La Salle - Graham H. Harris, Room 1018, 59 Clark St. - Mrs. Isabelle O'Keefe, 4857 Michigan Ave. - C. R. Walleck, 544 Blue Island Ave. and Joseph Stolz, 157 42nd Place.",
                "June 13, the committee will hold the great mass meeting to decide this important issue, and on this day the different committees should be present. It is necessary that the Italian Workers Societies should hold a meeting tomorrow to nominate a committee to represent the Italians of this city. We should thank each member of the Board of Education Committee individually and give special thanks to Mr. Walleck for his patience in writing to the L'Italia Editor and for the interest they have shown towards the teaching of the Italian language in the Elementary Schools."

The total number of Italian inhabitants here does not exceed 4,000. The number of children musicians, according to my estimate, runs from 125 to 150, and most of them are under the supervision, not of a padrone, but of their parents.",

                "In conclusion, the \"Celestial Messiah\" was found not guilty by Judge Harem and was cleared of the charge of illicit practices. Mrs. Mary Falzone was also freed of her charge. The \"Celestial Messiah\" triumphantly departed with his \"disciples.\""

Few arrests were made and no serious disorders occurred. The unusual good order was due to the urgent appeals of Father Petillo, pastor of the church.",
                "The crowd, numbering about 10,000 persons, was one of the largest which ever attended the festivities. Italians began surging into the village early in the morning. Police were stationed at intervals all along the car lines from the Desplaines River, as many disturbances have formerly occurred before the crowds reached Melrose Park. A dozen special police were added to the regular force of Melrose Park and most of the policemen were stationed along Twenty-fifth Ave., the village limits. Most of the places of amusement were located in the vacant ground in Proviso, which lies across the street.",

These games were the most popular forms of amusement and great crowds were gathered around them all day until late in the afternoon, when three deputy sheriffs arrived from Chicago and stopped their operation.",

Following this was another mass at nine o'clock, celebrated by Father Senese of St. Louis. High mass was held at ten o'clock, after which the procession formed in the street, headed by a figure representing the Virgin.",

Many zealous worshipers had thrown their jewelry at the feet of the figure,and watches and rings were also pinned over the bills.",
                "The privilege of carrying the figure was auctioned off to the highest bidder, as high as $110 being paid by one Italian for the honor. Following the statue were many women and children, chanting, and bearing large candles.",
                "The procession wound slowly through the streets, followed by several thousands of worshipers with bared heads. Two bands accompanied the procession. Three hours were consumed in the procession, which finally returned to the church about three o'clock in the afternoon. Before the figure of the Virgin was taken into the church, it was placed upon the steps for a few minutes where all could see it and another large sum of money was laid at its feet.",

Cuddled in the belief that our honest efforts to become an integral part of and to identify ourselves with the life of this country and that our unchallengeable record of the moral and material contribution to the greater glory of America had silenced the biased propaganda of unfriendly newspapers and irresponsible petty office-holders, we hoped also that the Royal Italian Consul General should never be forced to remind certain peoples, who owe to an Italian genius, and to the Italian initiative, the privilege of being today citizens of a great and free country, the primary principle of hospitality and a sense of justice.",
                "But what we thought had become a carcass, whose only claims to remembrance were due to its pestiferous exhalation, from time to time gives spasmodic symptoms of life, and stung by truth - untrammeled facts and statistical figures - spits falsehoods as a reptile spits poison.",
                "Actuated by resentment for the progress made by the Italians here and abroad, and fearing that the average, basking in the sunshine of a fictitious and superimposed equality is destined to be eliminated by the excellent, certain newspapers have represented a vulgar campaign of vilification against our race. To them have forcefully answered the Italian newspapers.",
                "But when some members of the police force slurred the honorable reputation of a section of the Italian people, calling them a bunch of criminals, to them answered the Royal Italian Consul General. We are glad to publish the letter that Comm. Carosi addressed to the Chief of Police of Chicago and to heartily congratulate him for the dignified and firm protest against accusation directed to hurt the peoples he represents.",

                "Imagine this supposed-to-be cultured person, a senator, a man who should have diplomatic manners, arising before so illustrious a body as the United States Senate and saying: \"It was a spy of Mussolini's who ordered the recent murder of seven men in Chicago because they would not swear allegiance to \"Fascism.\"",
                "How well informed is this senator! What a genius! A paragon of all men! However, he is not so well informed because the men killed through gangland's uprising were not Italians. That should suffice; furthermore, it would be best for Heflin to read a little foreign history and exercise at the same time the rusted cells of his cerebrum so as to understand the full meaning of Fascism. The Tribune is correct in saving Heflin has \"it,\" - but what? Not the \"it\" of the famous novel. But what? Surely not a solution to the recent slaughter in Chicago. Why! - that would be a sensation. It is odd that the authorities of Chicago hadn't discovered this super-detective before; this Sherlock; this master-mind, who, so far away, is capable of telling the forces of law and order who committed the murder. Such a man belongs in the detective bureau of Chicago, and not in the United States Senate.",
                "Only a person with a very narrow mind and living in the realm of prejudice can create such a theory. Probably Heflin, or rather Senator Heflin, is a strong believer, a follower of Thrasymachos - who was heard to say time and time again: \"For God is God and I am I.\"",
                "The senator should study conditions in Italy following the war, and conditions existing in Italy today. If this does not enlighten him, then he should absorb the constitution and during the process of absorption understand what is meant by \"religious tolerance.\" If all this has no bearing upon the closed areas of his brain, then he is a total impossibility. Men like this lost soul from Alabama, who wish to become famous overnight with their ridiculous ideas and conceptions, are the antagonists of the prejudiced Socialists. Men like this diety, for such he must be, in order to be able to give his absolute knowledge upon so difficult a matter, are the destructive parasites of human civilization, of law and order, of international peace.",

                "Heflin! Your attacks are not considered by the broad-minded students, the struggling laborers, the voting masses; for they are nothing more than an outburst of hatred from a narrow prejudiced mind, which had the misfortune to be given to you. It seems that you are trying to destroy the principles of our forefathers; the principle of foreign diplomacy, by your radical and fantastic ideas. The new civilization has arrived. It is at the gates of tomorrow, and it will gaze upon your works and marvel how you ever became senator. It will never mention your name; you will be listed on their roll of \"un-Americans,\" and you will never live down the disgrace which you have brought upon your state and upon yourself.",

                "Dear Sir:",
                "In the Tribune of Jan. 2nd, news from Nice, France was published under the caption \"Chicago Tribune Press Service\".",
                "It claimed that President Yrioyen of Argentina had signed a decree prohibiting Italian ships from entering the port of Buenos Aires until certain Mussolini regulations on military service affecting Italians who were naturalized Argentinians had been removed. The story stated that Mussolini bowed to the ultimatum from Argentina, removing said regulations.",
                "Strangely enough, the news of an ultimatum from Argentina to Italy does not arrive at your desk from correspondents in Buenos Aires or Rome, but just from Nice, France, which is not the capital of Argentina, or Italy, but only the capital of western European subservient forces distinguished as anti-Fascist.",
                "Stranger yet, not one of the other Chicago newspapers printed such news, although they have a foreign service as good as yours.",
                "From a very authoritative source, I have been informed that said news is absolutely unfounded in every respect.",
                "Your editorial staff with the article, \"International Nationalism\", published in the Tribune of Jan. 3rd, has shown ignorance of the most elementary principles of international law ruling citizenship and sovereignty among civilized countries, and, profiting by the same ignorance of the largest majority of the public in this matter, it has fully misrepresented things, only to write \"Un mucchio di fesserie\" (A mass of lies).",
                "The writer of said article states that \"under the terms of Mussolini's edict, children born of Italians on foreign soil are still Italians, and Italians of foreign citizenship returning to their native land are still Italian, subject in some cases, to military service\". He sees in it \"an insulting imperialistic practice\" of Mussolini.",
                "No Mussolini edict could modify the Italian codes and laws, unless enacted according to the provisions of the Italian constitution.",
                "The law ruling Italian citizenship is an Act of Parliament of 1912, (at that time Mussolini was not the premier of Italy) which absorbed some of the old regulations of the Italian legislation, adding to them more liberal and modern ones.",
                "According to said Act of 1912, which is still in force, children of Italian citizens born and residing in a foreign country maintain the Italian citizenship; but when of full age, or emancipated, they can renounce it. In this case, which is of election of nationality and not of naturalization, they are exempt from any military duty in Italy. (Art. 7 combined with the last part of Art. 8.)",
                "This is very logical and not imperialistic. In fact, the United States is doing the same thing with its laws on citizenship, by declaring that children born in foreign countries of American citizens are Americans. (Section 1993 U. S. Revised Statutes)",
                "In case an Italian naturalized American again obtains the Italian citizenship, his minor children born in America become Italian; but if they continue to reside in America, where they are considered Americans, they do not acquire Italian citizenship according to regulations of Art. 12 of said Act.",
                "Making a comparison of Italian and American citizenship laws, it appears that they have almost similar regulations inspired by the same judicial principles, and both countries are very careful not to diminish their sovereignty and independence before possible pretensions of other nations.",
                "Concerning military service, the Italian law on conscription makes this service compulsory for every male citizen able to bear arms. The Act of 1912 on citizenship, repeating old regulations of former laws and codes, decrees that an Italian who has lost Italian citizenship through naturalization in a foreign country, is not excused from military service.",
                "The reason for such disposition of law is a very logical and moral one. In fact, the military service is a burden on the citizen and many people would prefer to stay at home than to go to the colors.",
                "If the status of a newly acquired citizenship had been a reason for exemption, it would have been very easy for wealthy people, particularly those living near the boundary line, to take the citizenship of a bordering country and exempt themselves from the military service, while people with less money would have sustained alone the burden of the conscription law.",
                "The writer of the editorial in question vehemently accuses Italy and, particularly, Mussolini and Fascism, of imperialism; but he ignores, or at least it seems that he ignores that every European country has almost the same regulations as Italy in this particular case.",
                "In fact, the United States Department of the Interior published a pamphlet \"Notice to Bearers of Passports\" informing naturalized citizens of their possible military liability in the countries of their origin.",
                "According to the pamphlet, Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, France, Greece, The Netherlands, Poland, Rumania, Switzerland, Turkey, without having an imperialistic Mussolini, have compulsory military service and in these countries, American naturalized citizens also in some particular cases, are drafted for military service upon their return to the country of their origin and possibly sentenced to serve a term in jail, if they have committed an offense against the conscription law.",
                "Countries with the government of which the United States has concluded naturalization treaties, consider if such an offense has been committed before or after American naturalization; but the others, which are in the majority, do not make this distinction.",
                "The imperialism of Italy is then in good company!",
                "If, in the United States there were a compulsory military service law, they also would consider as subject to it the children of Americancitizens who were born American in foreign countries, this would be in perfect accord with the general principles of international law.",
                "Mussolini is not \"attempting to appropriate citizens of foreign nations\", as the writer of the article states; but, if anyone with many years of Italian government has reduced the burden of military service to Italians living abroad, naturalized or not, this surely is Mussolini. In fact, his government has been instrumental in having a law enacted which practically exempts all Italians living in foreign countries from actual service in the army, and gives them permission of returning to Italy for periods of six months, without being compelled into military service.",
                "With a previous law, Italian naturalized Americans, who, during the war had served under the American colors, were exempt from military service and penalties under the Italian conscription law which applied to those who had served less than one year under the American colors. A new regulation of law, enacted under the leadership of Mussolini, has reduced the time of one year to that of only one day.",
                "In conclusion it is very sad to realize that a man belonging to the editorial staff of the \"world's greatest newspaper\", in his heart and mentality is so little able to take pretext from a logically unfounded news to insult all the Italians in this country stating with sarcasm, that the Italian immigrants need to be fed and sweetened on the prairies of America; but they gave back to the United States a California, one of the richest states in the world.",
                "And when life was hard and dangerous in the trenches of France, the dark Italians of America, if not yet naturalized citizens, were also there representing twenty-five per cent of all American forces, to fight for the honor of the red, white and blue.",
                "At that time the writer of \"International Nationalism\", was, perhaps, sitting at his desk in the Chicago Tribune office, puffing at a good cigar."

                "\"We are being classified,\" a friend said to me. \"Someone is being paid to make a study of the Italians.\" And it is true. The local press is attempting to analyze certain manifestations of Italianism, classfying us into North, Northwest, West and South groups. Yes, it's a game, a hunt with the Italian as the prize. A game that is becoming more accentuated every day, and with it are increasing the ways and means of discouraging and expelling the Italian. The Immigration Law, the Naturalization Law, and the no less vicious, Prohibition Law were created, it seems, to strike at the Italian. A glance at the list of victims will alarm you.",
                "Is the majority of prevaricators among Italians? Homes of Italians are those most frequently visited by the forces of law and order, even at the risk of their lives.",
                "The situation is alarming and our people do not fully realize its gravity. They thoughtlessly go on as before, alone, disorganized in their fight for existence, in their daily trials humiliated by others, deceived by those among them, who should be their guides and, instead, are their betrayers.",
                "The mass of our people is eternally infantile and thoughtless. The majority come from the small towns of Italy, where life is confined to the customs and habits within the shadow of the \"Campanile\" and to the veneration of the patron saint, a veneration that is carried over to this country and is pictured on the standards of the mutual benefit societies organized for that purpose. Thus one can observe, at a glance, in the outstanding foreign sections of the city, the various groups, compact and typical of their small town or district. In this way we have made the distinction, even though from these groups there is a continuous falling away of those, who have allowed themselves to be assimilated into the American melting pot.",
                "We say, \"American\". The distinction is made by our own people to whom anyone, who does not speak Italian, is an American, He might be Jewish, Croation, Polish, Irish, and so forth, but to us he is an \"American.\" And this ingenuous distinction which we owe to the dull observation of the newly arrived, finds an echo in the Italophobic press, which reports with accentuated emphasis the deeds of Italian character and those which it refers to as typically Sicilian.",
                "The problem has many complications, especially for anyone who desires to throw the bright scientific analysis on the situation. But we cannot give this problem the time which it deserves, and can only give a few practical suggestions even at the cost of having some boor burst into jeering laughter.",
                "The fault lies in our excessive Italianism. We wave the Italian flag at a reckless height over a land which we do not dominate, be it by numbers, by inheritance, or for any other reason. That flag we must keep in our hearts. It is unwise to wave it in the face of a native element that, though having reverence for our ancestors, is intolerant of a people which is competing with it in the economic field.",
                "The local Italian press can teach the newcomers as well as those who have had a longer period of residence, one very important point, that in America one must do as the \"Americans\", just as our ancestors said, \"When in Rome do like the Romans.\"",
                "The Italian quarters should disappear, as they are disappearing, though very slowly. With the Italian quarters dismembered it will be easy to eliminate that odious classification, which is applied to our people.",
                "Discard your old country loyalties and your enemy will be left without a target. In fact I am sure that only in this manner can we obtain the dissolution of all animosities. Because your foe is not that which you have imagined him to be, the antithesis of all things Italian. On the contrary he,whom you call an enemy, is the true friend to the Italian.",
                "The \"American\" desires the Americanization of the Italian, developed and interested in the community, as an integral part and not like a worm that slowly gnaws into its peace and future.",
                "The Italian who knows how to act will never find any animosity directed against him. On the contrary he will be respected. America, in the main has learned to appreciate the Italian, to understand and to hold him in high esteem when he merits it. But it aims to rid itself of all those Italians who know not how, nor want to respect, the laws and customs of this country which has been so hospitable and generous.",
                "The American press in many cases goes to extremes, makes mountains out of mole-hills and seems to agitate against the entire Italian race. Against these abuses we are powerless for various reasons. We cite the principle; to us there is something wanting in a newspaper that is purely \"American\". The Italian press does not fill the need. Its voice does not carry where it should and where it does reach, it tends to make the situation more difficult. The times require a different reckoning. The older generation of laborers, or of a promiscuous existence, is disappearing and is being replaced by a better class. The new generation issues from the educational institution and invades the industrial and professional field. Therefore it has no time for the Italian weekly newspaper, or the daily, which is two days behind in reporting current news. The Italian press has exhausted its reason for being. It would be a meritorious action if our weeklies were to consolidate into a powerful Engish daily fighting the battle for Americanism, while maintaining the rights of Italisns on a par with those of others.",
                "This brief outline of conditions in Chicago can be applied to any locality where Italians are to be found in large groups and the few suggestions here stated can apply to all communities throughout America."

This information was acquired from authoritative sources, and is sufficient to give a thorough but uncomplimentary picture of us and for that reason I am not going to show it entirely. But in order that the reader may follow me on this journey with the Italians in America, it is necessary that we consider the foregoing words a prelude to a stormy voyage.",
                "The first question that presented itself to my mind in studying this problem of the Italians in America was - why and wherefore Italians in America? Going back over the path made by the Italian immigrants, I found myself in southern Italy. The path leading out of northern Italy was made by such a small percentage of those emigrating, that I decided to concentrate on the south. Therefore, this discussion is based largely on those who were born under the beautiful southern sky of my mother country.",
                "The social, economic and geographic conditions of America were, in many cases, unknown to the majority of my Italian brothers. Therefore, I had to reject the idea that they had been desirous of going to an unknown land. I also discovered that those who had gone to America, had not gone for the purpose of assuming any social responsibility; they had merely emigrated their bodies and changed their place of employment, but their souls had remained in Italy. Following more closely the tracks of these immigrants, I found occasional traces that appeared American. With this suspicion in mind and with the desire of knowing the character of this America that had walked alongside so many Italians, I followed its direction and soon found myself in America.",

                "The foot-prints had finally led me to my destination. I found myself in front of a sumptuous palace. The richly liveried footman stopped me at the door. \"My master, the mine-owner, is not at home\", he replied in answer to my question. I asked him where I could find him. \"Probably at the Millionaires' Club. But I doubt whether you can speak to him. Since his trip to Italy with the owners of the railroads and steamship lines, he has found such a close friendship with them, that he will have very little, if any, time to talk to you.\" Having gotten all the information for which I was searching, I decided to journey among the Italians in America.",
                "Since the time of readers is limited and since this periodical is circulated mostly in the Middle West, I shall ask the reader to please accompany me on a tour among the Italians of Chicago. On this tour you shall witness scenes that can be duplicated in New York and other large cosmopolitan centers of America.",
                "There are 200,000 Italians in Chicago, divided into four groups. Of that number, seventy-three per cent are laborers. That includes all those who, according to the laws of Illinois, are of working age. Twenty-two per cent are illiterates. Nine per cent are physically handicapped and seven per cent have criminal records. These figures, although not exact, are very close to the truth and the difference, if any, is very small. Going a bit further, we find that three organizations have issued statistics on the amount of money necessary to a family of more than five for a year. This sum, which covers every possible expenditure, is necessary to live, not comfortably, but decently. Of the three figures arrived at, that of the National Industrial Conference is the lowest with $1,697.95.",
                "The average pay of the laborer is $.50 per hour. With a twenty per cent loss of time for one reason or another throughout the year, the laborer earns about $1,050. Therefore, seventy-three per cent earn $500 less than the sum necessary for a decent livelihood. Consequently, the result is as follows:",
                "Obliged to live in houses too small for the number of persons in a family, the small house means -",
                "(1) Insufficient ventilation.",
                "(2) Difficulty in keeping it clean.",
                "(3) Danger of immorality.",
                "Obliged to eat food which, in many cases, is deficient in nutritive value especially for children, this fact is largely responsible for the fourteen per cent physically deficient individuals. (By physically deficient, we also mean those who fall below the scientific requirements for height and weight.)",
                "Obliged to abandon school as soon as the law allows them to seek employment, is another reason for their poverty. Summing up these facts, we are still faced with a solution of the problem. The problem is that because of a lack of education, the seventy-three per cent of laborers will be increased. Because of an insufficient amount of good food and ignorance of hygiene, physical deficiency will increase. Because of a lack of courage and the augmenting of poverty, (not a lack of courage to face hard work) there will be an increase in the seven per cent of criminal delinquents.",
                "Many have been called upon to give a solution to this enormous and dangerous problem. The Government of the United States has answered the call; but to date, without any success. The proprietors of the Trans-Atlantic lines, the railroads, and the mines, answered the call; but without enthusiasm for the solution of this problem. They, who answered with all their hearts and souls, and with open purses, were the Christians of America. But, unfortunately, even this did not bring about the desired results; because the majority of Italians are not Christian and if they believe otherwise, they believe falsely. Practically they do not show it.",
                "My dear Italians, I must halt at this point, because to continue this journey would be fatiguing. I ask your kind indulgence if I have taken you to see landscapes that did not please you, and if in order to conduct you to the place which I had chosen, I was forced to lead you through by-ways that were dark and dirty. I rest with the hope that in some future journey, we shall find better paths and more beautiful landscapes. And, while I am on the subject, allow me to say one thing more.",
                "I would that you reflected yourselves in the mirror of modern civilization. You would undoubtedly see many traditions that are not now in use. You would see yourselves slaves of a religion that never has and never will make you Christians. You will see yourselves placed under the same conditions as your ancestors, who were abused in their ignorance. Do not try to follow something new with an old system. Do not try to be ashamed of yourselves. Do not allow the cry of Jeremiah to be heard again, after Jesus came to dry his tears; but instead, go in search of Jesus that he may dry your tears. Do not immerse yourselves in your traditions, which, for the most part, carry a taint of ridicule and ignorance. I have seen you many times in your processions carrying the saints and never in the ranks have I seen those on whom the good future of the nation depends entirely. I have seen politicians who hoped through religion to better their political standing, and I have seen merchants who, to me, resembled those whom Jesus drove out of the temple of Jerusalem.",
                "I have seen you in long files that resembled the files of prisoners I saw during the war, and I thought that you were actually prisoners of that liberty which America has given to those who have come to enjoy it. And I wept, because, like you, I am Italian, because as an immigrant I carry in my kit many of the troubles that are also yours. I wept because I have your best interests at heart."

But now there came multitudes of men of the lowest class, from the south of Italy, and men of the meaner sort out of Hungary and Poland, men out of the ranks where there was neither skill nor energy, nor any initiative of quick intelligence; and they came in numbers which increased from year to year, as if the countries of the south of Europe were disburdening themselves, of the more sordid and hapless elements of their population.

But the Tribune, after justly reproving the one-hundred-fifty or so Italians, as not being examples of the Italian Colony as a whole, with which we are in agreement, goes on to make some inexact and inopportune statements. The article follows:",
                "The Italian Societies ask Mayor Busse to use his influence to have the Christopher Columbus Memorial Fountain now standing isolated in South Chicago, set free from uncongenial and sordid surroundings. They would like to have him set up in some pleasant public place, preferably Lincoln Park, where the Italians could go occasionally and pay their respects to a man who did so much for them. They are all agreed, that if he did not discover America, they would not today be flourishing citizens of this free and independent republic. They would be working hard for a poor living in overcrowded Italy.",
                "Now there is a way in which the Italian societies get the whole souled support of Mayor Busse in this matter of the banished Columbus. They have come to Chicago as the result of his great discovery, many bad as well as many good Italians. The former give their fellow-countrymen and the public, infinite trouble. If the good Italians shall organize and give the police appreciative assistance in running down, bringing to justice, or driving out of town, their \"Black Hand\" nationals, they will benefit themselves and the community, and show themselves worthy compatriots of that great man \"Christopher Columbus.\" If they were to do that and they can do it, they would have a right to demand the triumphant return of Columbus from his unsuitable quarters in South Chicago.",

                "The harsh words of Chicago's greatest newspaper were not sufficient to close the mouth or stay the pen of the Italian Chevalier, Dr. Camillo Violini, who is always ready to defend the Italians. He has replied with the following article, which appeared in Wednesday's issue of the Tribune:",
                "Italians Feel At Home Here: But in order to be fair to everybody, I will call the attention of your readers, if you will allow me, to a few facts that it might be well to remember if we really have the welfare of this great city at heart. First of all, it is useless for me to remark that the Italian people are not the only people that ought to be grateful to Columbus for his great discovery; perhaps people of different nationalities would be laboring under great or greater difficulties for a living in other crowded European countries, were it not for this great genius. The fact that some may have derived benefits from his work, long before the Italians did, in so small a scale, does not conceal the truth, that we ought to feel at home here, at least as much as all the rest of the people who sailed from Europe a few generations ahead of us.",
                "It will not be out of place to state, at this moment, that Italy's merit in the discovery of America, does not lie in the simple fact that Christopher Columbus was born in Italy, but that his genius was the true product of the Italian progress and civilization of that period; because hundreds of thinking Italians from Brunetto Latini (12th century) to Toscanelli (15th century) had worked to find the fundamental principles on which the immortal Columbus founded his great discovery, while the great scientists of all Europe (England, France, Spain), were ridiculing his project.",
                "Full Payment for all Benefits.",
                "And this I state, simply because of the fact, that between the lines of your esteemed editorial transpires, too prominently, the idea of the great benefits that we, remote and starved strangers, have derived from the discovery of Columbus. You, certainly, do not ignore the belief that the Italian laborers, since they have put foot in this country, have contributed their share to increase the wealth of this nation, and for every dollar received in payment for honest work, that they have made five or ten dollars richer, some more fortunate mortal who happened to land here ahead of them.",
                "But all this does not in any way destroy the fact that we are in a certain measure responsible for all the shortcomings of our immigration of today, and ought to cooperate with the authorities in general, to wipe out a certain kind of criminality that is a stain on our otherwise good name. At the same time that all the community, authorities, and newspapers as well, ought to strive also for the welfare of us all to put down the hundreds of holdup men, burglars, murderers, and allied criminals, that so abundantly flourish in this great city. Criminals do not wear the Italian stamp, but the mark of some more civilized nationality; a fact that is so carefully concealed by some publications.",
                "I take this occasion, Mr. Editor, to extend to you my personal thanks for the support that your paper has given to the Italian White Hand Society, organized last year, for the very purpose that forms the patriotic appeal of your editorial.",
                "White Hand Works Much Good.",
                "I, and a good many of my countrymen, feel that we have demonstrated that the society has partly filled an empty space in the shortcomings of some of your political bodies that have the responsibility to insure to every citizen peaceful enjoyment of his domestic life and prosperity. As we have stated in our Treatise just published, our cooperation with the authorities will avail next to nothing unless certain degradingly low political influences, that keep open sone unnamable resorts where this criminality finds its best working ground, are wiped out of existence.",
                "I also agree with you that parades such as that of last Sunday, and for the matter of that, every Sunday, and many other days of the year, ought to be stamped out by the authorities which have the responsibility of seeing that the policemen who lead these ridiculous demonstrations are sent after criminals of all descriptions, (as that is what the policemen are paid for) regardless of what the complacent aldermen of this or that ward may give as his personal motives.",

The work of this fifth convention will last for ten days. Grave and urgent problems face the delegates. The future, whether flourishing or not, will depend on the resolution taken.",
                "In its nine years of existence, the Amalgamated has recorded truly triumphal successes. From stage to stage it has gone forward to the point of becoming a formidable advance-guard in the workers' movement in America. Its successes, aside from the ability of its directors and the spirit of abnegation with which it has inculcated its members, are based on a main principle to which it has constantly recurred in all its acts: the principle of intensive unity and action.",
                "In the four preceding conventions none dared to present proposals which would to any extent damage this sacred principle, which is the key to the success of all the proletarian organisms, and the structure of the ever-growing organization remained as solid as a granite rock, a safe guarantee of other and major successes.",
                "In this convention, they said to us, something will emanate which will disturb the serenity of unionistic atmosphere. The electrifying spirit, which in other conventions amalgamated the enthusiasms and intellectual energies of all, at this convention shall be substituted by the spirit of sedition.",
                "We mean to allude to the proposal which will be made for adhesion to Moscow. Whenever a similar proposal crept in, it produced nothing but discord and confusion in the ranks of the working masses and contentment and jubilation in the camp of the enemy, which knew how to profit to its advantage in its reactionary aims. In remembering this truth, we have no intention of giving advice to, or imposing our views on anyone. We do not belong to that category of subversive \"self appointed saviours of the world\" who cry, \"Moscow is the truth, the just, the infallible, he who does not follow Moscow is a traitor, a counter-revolutionary and with the seal of approval of the Holy Apostolic Inquisition of horrible memory.\"",
                "We do not consider the comrades of the Amalgamated to be so imbecile as to need advice or that of the \"Fighting Leaders,\" for the solution of their problems. We, without meaning any offense to the intelligence of the comrade delegates, make this simple statement of fact which has already been stated by certain leaders of the same Amalgamated, as for example: Poftosky on his return from Europe.",
                "Whether or not the Moscow proposal is accepted or rejected, one thing leaps into our mind, over and above the immediate or remote ends of the proposers and the opposers of the project. The moment in which a group is formed within the Amalgamated that prefers to win a tactical point, despite the desire of the others and without any regard for what may result, from that instant, the Amalgamated parts from the road of unity for which it has fought, in order to travel the tortuous road of disunity, where 50 % of its energies previously dedicated to the increment and perfectioning of its organisms will be wasted in frictions and diatribes.",
                "We merely authenticate, not predict. We base our statement on what has happened in France, what is happening in America and what is happening to the International Ladies Garment Workers' Union and the Furriers Union, etc.",
                "Perhaps it was fatal for the Amalgamated, equally with other advance-guard organizations, to soak itself in the tepid baths, disturbed by the obstinacy of that group that could have used the motive force issuing from the greatest revolution for the general advantage of the world movement of the working class, instead of abusing it in order to expel this last in the mazes of this Bakunistic confusion.",
                "And so be it! And we hope that it will escape soon, and that the lesson served to replace on the old and good way."

                "On February 14, 1922, for the first time in the history of Chicago, representatives of the barons of the tailoring industry met a committee from the A. C. W. A. [Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America]. They were the first to make such a concession to the demands of the A. C. W. A., which is a strong, feared organization.",
                "The bosses presented twelve demands. Among the most important were the following:",
                "1. The absolute right to fire employes and to discipline them as they so desire.",
                "2. Restoration of the right to seek workers necessary to industry, from the open shop. This would mean a return to the old system which forced the worker to go begging for work from shop to shop.",
                "3. Abolition of the system of equal distribution of work among the tailors.",
                "4. Elimination of all rules and regulations which prevail among the cutters.",
                "5. Extension of the work week from 44 to 48 hours a week, and a general reduction [in wages] of 25 per cent.",
                "The negotiations lasted seven long weeks; the procedure was arduous and required much patience; almost to the last hour it was impossible to predict an accord between the committees capital and labor, and each time they met, a new aspect was given the situation. One day promised peace, another strife. The water was so turbid, it was impossible to give inquiring workers concrete and clear information.",
                "It is to be noted, however, that the workers knew, as we did, that the position of the organization was immovable, and that the only point which could be discussed with the intention of making some concession was that of the pay reduction. Not because we believe that the tailors are overpaid, but because, from one end of the country to the other, wages are being reduced without pity, and therefore, the organization had taken the position that if a small reduction was the only obstacle to agreement, it was best to accept it. A ten per cent reduction was agreed upon.",
                "But the other demands of the employers were rejected, and the strength of the organization has remained intact. The voice of the worker will continue to make itself heard in the tailoring industry. The bosses knew that the organization was, and is, well prepared-morally and financially. In fact they admitted that a strike by the Amalgamated Clothing Workers would throw the majority of the tailoring firms into bankruptcy.",
                "The contract was finally drawn up on April 3. It was immediately submitted to the Chicago Joint Board, to the conference delegates, and the Shop Chairmen. All unanimously accepted it.",
                "Tuesday, April 4, the contract was presented to the members in general session at four mass meetings in different parts of the city. Their ratification was the authorization for the representatives of the union to sign the contract, which will last for three years: from May 1, 1922 to April 30, 1925.",
                "The rights of the workers remain sacred and inviolate. When the bosses are ready to hire they must apply to the office of the organization, and only in the event of a shortage of union tailors is it permissible for the bosses to go into the open market.",
                "The power to discharge shall be exercised only by an authorized and responsible representative of the employer, so that it will be impossible for the strutters and ambitious little straw-bosses to punish arbitrarily, as they did in the past. Any time the union feels that an employe has been unjustly treated, and an adjustment cannot be arrived at with the company representatives, the case goes before a board of arbitration for a decision. It is also specifically recognized that during a slack period in the industry, when the amount of work is insufficient to keep all busy, the work must be pro-rated. The Chairman is definitely recognized as the accredited representative of the organization, functioning in the factory for the purpose of safeguarding the rights of the workers."

Upon you workers rests the task of stirring up the masses, who are still the slaves of prejudice and are still chained to the bourgeoisie's wagon. The Socialist party, our mother organization, has been marching forward for years and is getting ready to inspire new life in the solid, united proletarian class of America, preparing it to meet in pitched battle the two capitalistic parties of the United States, which are using political power to consolidate their class predominance to the absolute detriment of the populous ranks of the producers.",

The criminal indifference of the American working class must come to an end; it is the duty of the Socialist party to lead the masses to victory. This should be your resolve as you celebrate the historic date of the First of May.

                "Many speeches were delivered by various speakers who were glad because of the success of the banquet, and also glad because anybody and everything there was truly Socialist. The speakers also praised the efforts of Mr. Debs in support of the Socialist cause, and his other activities on behalf of the oppressed workers.",
                "At the end, Mr. Debs thanked the Italian Socialists for the splendid reception given him, and he also thanked all those that honored him with their presence. He said that never in his life would he forget that evening, which still more strengthened his conviction to multiply his efforts in behalf of the Socialist Party until the goal is reached.",

The Communist Labor Party News, during the convention in Chicago, carried among the list of delegates, the representatives of the Italian Socialist Federation, whose membership was reported as one thousand. It is to be noted that at the time, our Federation accounted for that number of members, and that it had sent its delegate, John La Soca, to the Convention of the Socialist Party.",

Some self-styled Socialists and various subversive elements then bellowed with all their strength into that flame with the hope of seeing the Italian Federation reduced to ashes.",

And so, other internal struggles, other arguments, other misunderstandings resulted; and the small raft of the Federation, assailed on all sides by waves that attempted to submerge it, fought against them with tenacity-and did not perish.",
                "Calm followed the storm, and at the Convention of Oct., 1919, after a heated discussion, an Order of the Day was voted upon and accepted by all-whether middle, left or right \"wingers.\" And to-day, with a membership of one thousand, to which it has held on since 1914, it is the only organization that has been capable of putting up a front against the revolutionary hurricane from the East. A hurricane which proposed to destroy capitalism, but instead served only to strenghten it, thus weakening the Socialist movement in America.",
                "Although every now and then a member would leave us for the Communist Party, we still held on to our one thousand members, and it seemed as though we would now live in peace and direct our efforts to the propagation of our ideals, and the struggle against the enemies of suffering humanity. But we again deceived ourselves because a small group of semi-Communists has arisen in New York, under the leadership of Negri, and with calumnies and rank stones, initiated another fight against the Socialist Party and the Federation.",

We have a right to except you to be consistent, because, just as you attacked the Socialist Party for not joining the Third International, you should also, if sincere, attack and accuse the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, which is not an affiliate of the Red International, branch of the Third International.",

                "No, we Socialists are not Utopians any more. Our great philosophers of half a century ago were called Utopians when with audacious intuition they divined the coming of Socialism. But to-day Socialism is not a Utopia; it is a reality, which exists under our very eyes. To-day Socialism is assailed, not tolerated as a dream, and the assault upon it shows that it is recognized as something tangible, like men and things.",
                "Others are the Utopians to-day. Others, to-day, dream dreams and contemplate impossibilities. These dreamers are those who delude themselves into thinking that they can arrest the development of Socialism.",
                "In America this type of Utopian bears the name of Democrat or Progressive.",
                "He is a follower of Wilson, of Bryan, or of Roosevelt, whose Utopian efforts seem to be sincerely directed toward the defense of their own bourgeois class, to which, as we know, the advent of Socialism has dealt the death-blow. That is, these Utopians are people sincerely desirous of saving themselves from Socialism, but definitely outside the pale of communal thought.",
                "We have followed them in the last presidential campaign and in recent governmental policies, and their reasonings and their actions are very familiar to us. Here are some examples.",
                "On the question of the trusts they reason thus. The manufacturers and distributors have ceased to compete against each other and have organized themselves into colossal enterprises creating a monopoly on goods and a control of prices, thus forming the trusts. But all this leads to Socialism. Therefore we will pass a law prohibiting manufacturers and distributors from making any kind of agreement or plan which will remove uncertainty from the future. By law we will force them again to engage in the war of business competition, and we will also dissolve by law the trusts now in existence.",
                "Any person with common sense can see the puerility of this line of reasoning. The fusion of the forces of capital is a necessary evolutionary stage in the development of capitalism itself and not, most certainly, a new discovery or whim of humanity. It is as ridiculous to demand the return of competition as to expect the ripe ear of corn to return to grass or the railroad to be supplanted by the stage-coach. It is absurd and Utopian. And if it is true (as the progressive Democrats have declared, and as we firmly believe) that the formation of trusts leads to Socialism, then it matters not how many laws Wilson puts through his legislative bodies, for into Socialism we shall inevitably be drawn.",
                "On the tariff question Wilson reasons thus. The cost of living rises menacingly; the people are united and support the radical parties; in order to arrest this swelling of the Socialist ranks, we must kill the high cost of living; to achieve that, we must remove the tariff from the most necessary commodities.",
                "Behold! Wilson and the Congress revise the tariff, but the cost of living rises higher. And why? Because the tariff has no connection with the cost of living. The dispute about the tariff is nothing more than an argument among factions of capitalists. The cost of living is governed by factors much more complex, which we have explained in these columns a number of times. Therefore, being wrong in their diagnosis, they have also chosen the wrong cure. If the high cost of living is a maker of Socialists, it will continue to be so, Wilson may be assured, regardless of his Utopian legislation.",
                "The last and most colossal creation of Democratic-Progressive Utopianism was brought to birth a few days ago in the banking and finance bill known as the currency bill. According to Wilson the periodical depressions which hit this country are caused by a defective system of banking and finance. These terrible crises which every now and then, like earthquakes, shake the foundations of our bourgeois society have given food for thought to quite a few men besides Wilson, not only because of the immediate harm which they cause to the world of finance but also because of the suffering of the workers, who are becoming more and more firmly convinced that something is amiss in the workings of this society of ours, in which the wheels of industry come periodically to a sudden stop and are set in motion again only after much suffering. These little paralytic strokes may at some time or other prove fatal to our decrepit bourgeois society and result in the emergence of a system more logical and just. We absolutely must stop these industrial depressions, says Wilson, and then he presents us with the currency bill.",
                "Poor Wilson! Your anti-Socialist zeal, laudable from the bourgeois point of view, will again prove to be nothing more than an expression of your Utopian mind. With or without the currency bill, the industrial crises will continue to come, each worse than the one preceding, until to your sorrow the bourgeois society gasps its last breath.",
                "In the face of all this tragedy an authoritative newspaper of Berlin carries an item facetiously stating that because of the currency bill Wilson should be called an irresponsible and dangerous Socialist. Behold the gratitude of the world! You, Wilson, while employing any or all fantastic means to arrest the advent of Socialism are called a \"dangerous Socialist.\" It is the height of injustice and ingratitude.",
                "The same injustice was suffered by Roosevelt when he preached his radical program to the people in the last campaign. But he knew what answer to make, for with his usual cleverness he said, \"Fools, you call me a Socialist! My program is an antidote for Socialism.\"",
                "That, Mr. Wilson, was what Roosevelt thought of his program, and it is what you think of yours. But history will prove that neither one of you is a Socialist or an anti-Socialist. It will prove that you are both Utopians.",

A businessman of Williamsburg, Indiana (where these events took place), telephoned to the sheriff at Richmond, Indiana, who rushed to the place on a special train, accompanied by a fully-armed posse. In the meantime Bailey, the chief of police of Richmond, and the public prosecutor, Jessup, went to Williamsburg by automobile.",

                "\"Do not the anti-clericals sometimes carry their partisan sentiments almost to the point of violence?\" was asked.",
                "\"There seems to be an unfortunate confusion in Chicago as to the anti-clerical party of Italy\", Miss Addams replied. The present party dates its activity from the beginning of the movement for political unification of Italy. It opposes the temporal power of the vatican and the domination of the clergy in political affairs. Its platform distinctly affirms the authority of the church in spiritual matters. Doubtless it has many foes of the church in its ranks, but also many devout Catholics and priests.",
                "Many of the leading citizens of the Italian colony in Chicago who are devout Catholics and yet belong to the anti-clerical party say that it is hard to be at once a good Catholic and a good patriot. They contrast their position with that of the Irish whose loyalty to home rule does not conflict with their loyalty to the church.",
                "Clash with the Clergy.",
                "\"There were incidents in the Italian colony which were attended with much irritation between the clericals and the anti-clericals. The first of these was the proposition to name the old Polk Street School after Garibaldi. This proposition was received with enthusiasm by a large proportion of the Italian colony, but met with serious opposition by the clergy. The name was finally abandoned, but the controversy over it lasted for almost two years.",
                "\"It was difficult for Americans to understand the bitterness of feeling shown by both sides. La Tribuna Italiana became the organ of the Italians wishing the school called Garibaldi and carried on the controversy with a zeal and invective of which the Southern Italian is past master. The other side was taken up with equal zeal in the pages of the New World. I myself and several other residents of Hull House had conversations with both Father Dunne and Signor Valerio, in which we deplored the bitterness of feeling which it would certainly take years to allay.",
                "\"The perusal of both sets of articles left upon one's mind an impression of an hostility whose bitterness was based upon a struggle much older and sterner than the mere matter of the naming of a school, but neither of the journals contained even a veiled threat of personal injury to its opponent. Indeed the threat which has been quoted from the Tribuna Italiana as presumably the worst one was a quotation from Dante implying that the leader of the opposition must in the end \"weep tears of repentance more bitter than the salt mines of Cervia.\" On the other hand the article in the New World most hotly resented by the Italians was one entitled \"Garibaldian's Nose is Broken in Chicago.",
                "Garibaldi National Hero.",
                "\"The Italians look on Garibaldi as the national hero. Almost every Italian town has his statue and a street named after him. The Italians in Chicago point to the fact that the Poles here are permitted to call a school after Kosciusko and the Hungarians one after Kossuth, and they cannot understand why they are not permitted to call one after Garibaldi.",
                "\"The second instance which again stirred antagonism between the two parties occurred at the burial of Count Rozwadowski, the Italian consul, when the effort was made to bar the Italian flag from the church.\"",
                "In Italy itself, where the battle had been raging for more than 50 years, competent observers agree that the antagonism between the black or Vatican party and the white or anti-clerical party is fast dying out, and it seems deplorable that it should be continued in Chicago and most unjust to revive it in connection with the dastardly murder at Denver.",
                "\"The patriotic Italian dreads and fears the small body of desperate anarchists in Italy quite as much as does the patriotic American here. He recognizes them as entirely distinct from the anti-clerical party and from that of the socialists, who again form a separate political party, with their own members in parliament. The Christian democrats constitute a large party of devout Catholic laymen and clergy, but which also, like the anti-clerical party, is opposed by the Vatican. The repudiation of this party was most strikingly shown by the placing of Fogazzaro's book \"The Saint\" seven years in study in Rome is doubtless aware of the distinctions between these parties.",
                "\"To confound the anti-clerical party with the anarchists is almost as unjust as to so call the party in England which has long stood for the separation of church and state.\""

He calls us assassins, not because he fears further killings, but because he is afraid that the masses, who have ever been the dupes of craftiness and prevarication, may open their eyes and sweep away with one stroke all the rogues who delude and exploit them and trample on them, making their lives a Hell while they extort them to wait patiently for a Paradise beyond.",

The only result of this move on the part of Barasa, in a county that carries 900,000 registered voters, will be to take away a large part of the Italian vote from Judge Crowe, who has always been a loyal and fervid friend of our people, who married a woman of our race, who is raising an Italian family and has always shown himself in sympathy with the aspirations of our people.",

Then a first lieutenant, mutilated in the recent World War, spoke and he had words of great admiration for the Italians of the 19th Ward, that fought with him in the war, like lions. His speech received many cheers.",
                "Judge Barasa, delivered a great speech also, and he too, was applauded. His popularity is gaining ground every day. During the banquet, we had the opportunity to hear good music and songs through the generosity of Mr. James Colosimo.",
                "Admired was the trio formed by the Cav. Isidore Prati, tenor; D. Giacobelli, baritone; and Mrs. D. Atta, soprano. They revealed themselves as true artists. Miss Dale winters, with her beautiful voice, sang a few songs and at the end, Mr. Piccolo, an expert amateur, sang two Neapolitan songs with much feeling. Everyone was praised and admired. At the piano, was the expert maestro, Minutolo.",
                "In conclusion, we can say that the banquet was very successful, and very congenial, and we give our best congratulations and thanks to the organizers, Mr. Adolph Marx, Hector Durante, and John Rausau."

But it is necessary that they should have an exact idea of the struggle in which they are to take part.

The residents have many things to thank him for. Through his hard work he made it possible to have Lake street paved and secured the street car extension to 25th avenue.

He will discharge his duties with honor and distinction to himself, and satisfaction to the people. He will prove the greatest single factor Melrose Park has ever had and the community will be exceedingly glad to return him to office indefinitely. Joe will not have to he be remained that the people elected him. He will know how to serve them. Joe comes from the school of experience, from that Italo-American Stock that is daily enriching America with valuable material for public office. With an unsurpassed historical heritage, combining the innate political acumen of their forbears, the Romans, inured to the pioneering hardships of the latest arrivals to these shores; with American education and experience, which has given them a thorough knowledge of American institutions, these young Italo-Americans like Joe, will cleave their way into American politics and as their kinred have done thus far, will give an honorable account of themselves. They will make America feel proud of these new children.",
                "Imburgio's victory is a victory of the Italians in America; it should serve as a great incentive for good to the young, Italo-Americans in Chicago. The names of other Americans of Italian extraction, who have served and are now serving creditably in public offices all over the United States, should spur them on to greater achievements.",

And further, I wish to add that they receive these benefits not because they merited reward but because they are responsible for base deeds and vile calumnies set in motion against honest workers who are replaced by these \"cossacks.\" This happens even in cases where the worker has been on the job for ten years or more and has never given cause for complaint except to rebel against injustices.",

                "Mr. Carnovale is a rare personality in the Italian colony of Chicago, or better, in the entire United States. However, he has not been able to raise the cultural and civic level of his neighbors because they-like so many other colonists are dominated to a great extent by politico-criminal racketeers, and by certain Italian and American religious sects. These factors lead to scornful isolation, as shown by the greatest number of the truly honest and sincere Italian immigrants.",
                "Of the works written by Mr. Carnovale, I have read, somewhat superficially, only what I consider his best, \"Why Italy Participated in the Great War.\" It is true to history, and is an excellent textbook for Italian chronology.",
                "I was about to review it when, in the Spring of 1918, I decided suddenly to leave Chicago. However, now that the chapter in this major work entitled \"Human Solidarity,\" has been re-edited and republished by Mr. Carnovale under the title, \"Only the Abolition of Neutrality Will Prevent Wars Immediately and For All Time,\" I shall attempt a politico-social criticism of the latter.",
                "Mr. Luigi Carnovale is one of those many literary philosophers who, because they live all to themselves, are not always able to create a real picture of social life beyond books and reviews.",
                "In another major work, \"Why Italy Participated in the Great War,\" Mr. Carnovale has completely justified Italy for joining in that great slaughter. However, much evidence to the contrary has come to light overseas, in the form of vile diplomatic documents issued by the Allies, as well as the Central Powers.",
                "Moreover, the expression of all our ideas in newspaper articles, although censured and emasculated in America and in Italy, does not justify the entry of Great Britain, the United States and Italy in the World War.",
                "Neither could this participation be justified from the bourgeois point of view, based on capitalistic interests, or on the conquest of mines and colonies. Only France and Belgium can explain their participation.",
                "Thus, Italy could have remained out of the war, because the pact of London had already granted to her-in case of victory for the Allies-Trento, Trieste and part of Albania.",
                "Again, a telegram sent by King Victor Emanuel III to his dear cousin Francis Joseph, justified Italy's neutrality on the basis of the Triple Alliance. Incidentally, we should note that the telegram did not protest against Austria's invasion of Serbia. Just the opposite, it ended with the sender's good wishes. However, this neutrality was a farce, because, during its enforcement - and even when Italy was in a state of war with the Central Powers, Italian capitalists were selling food stuffs and ammunitions to Austria and Germany!",
                "Finally, Italian neutrality was bought through the sly and vulgar diplomacy of the Allies, who took advantage of the weakness of Italian politicians and dragged Italy and Roumania on their side, although Italy had no military preparation, and her supplies, as we said above, had been already sold to her former allies.",
                "The greater portion of the Italian people, blinded like so many other nations, gave to the World War its finest blood and energies, without even the satisfaction of knowing of the existing Pact of London, and of its reward in case of victory. This pact was divulged in 1917 by the Bolsheviks, two years after its framing.",
                "Although official Italy participated in the peace negotiations as the fourth signatory of the Pact of London, she received less consideration than Belgium.",
                "Moreover, after the war, official Italy issued reports of her enormous losses in men and money. One million and a half were killed or permanently disabled, and 100,000,000 liras was spent-a sum more than the total wealth of the nation.",
                "In spite of these great sacrifices, no impression was made upon the three other signatories, Great Britain, France, and Russia, who dictated a peace treaty according to their own interests and solely to create new hatreds among peoples.",
                "Therefore, we reach the conclusion that Mr. Carnovale was wrong in justifying Italy's entry in the World War.",
                "If we go back to the chapter, entitled \"Only the Abolition of Neutrality Will Prevent Wars Immediately and for All Time,\" we find that Mr. Carnovale describes therein a socially impracticable utopia, humane and brutal at the same time. This shows that the author does not realize the malice of our present capitalistic society and of its vile diplomacy.",
                "In other words, Mr. Carnovale's idea purports that when a nation declares war on another, all the other nations should array themselves against the nation or nations which, according to him, were wrong in provoking the war. Very naively he adds that mankind is perfectly able to judge between the guilty offenders and their innocent victims!",
                "As to colonization, Mr. Carnovale justifies the seizure of \"uncivilized\" territories by the European powers. Thus, Italy has a \"historical right\" over Eritrea and Libya in Africa, particularly over the latter, because of the monuments left there by the Romans. Thus, Belgium has the same kind of right over Congo, Great Britain over India and Transvaal, the United States over the Philippines, France over Morocco, etc.",
                "Only the Socialists protested against these colonial conquests. In Italy, at the time of the annexation of Eritrea in 1890, a protest was made only by the five Socialist-and a couple of radical-representatives in the Italian Chamber.",
                "In reply to Mr. Carnovale's plea for the abolition of neutrality, my friend Ginseppe Bertelli and I can indicate a better road toward international amity. That is: the abolition of private property, national frontiers, and national flags.",
                "This international socialist regime would curb or punish any racial group or groups which might attempt to endanger universal peace.",
                "Peoples will become truly civilized only when they acquire a true civic conscience: that is, an understanding of mutual freedom. This means that an offense directed at one person or group is equivalent to one directed against entire humanity.",

                "Now that war is begun, now that nothing can be done to stop the bloodshed, we have only one desire: that Germany and Austria, the nations responsible for this brutal butchery, should be beaten. Thus their respective peoples, after the bitter [taste] of defeat, will throw out the monarchies, and largely influenced by the Socialist workers, will organize themselves into democratic republics.",

Within a radius of forty miles from Muscle Shoals there is an abundance of wines which produce the following minerals:",

                "In Sheffield there is a district which could be used for farming, especially in the Tennessee River Valley. These lands, at present, are planted in cotton but will produce corn, buckwheat, potatoes, vegetables, and, possibly, grapes. However, the prices for land are unreasonably high. More than one thousand acres are cleared of timber and ready for cultivation, but these acres are sub-divided into house-lots, and not tracts large enough to make their cultivation profitable.",

                "During our visit to the Chamber of Commerce of Tuscumia and Sheffield, we formed the impression that Mr. Phinn and his associates were mainly interested in selling building lots at enormous prices, with only a promise of the future industrial development of that region.",
                "Muscle Shoals, undoubtedly, will have a great future when the Government, or Henry Ford builds factories that will employ thousands of men. It was pointed out to us that the value of these lots will increase and thus give the owner a chance to make a profit. Mr. Bambara and Chevalier Chiappe were told that 40,000 lots were sold by various real estate firms, some as far as ten miles from Muscle Shoals.",
                "With Mr. Phinn as our escort we visited the Government nitrate and explosives factories. We then made a tour of the mining camps. Our investigation, especially, of Iron Mine brought out the fact mine laborers are paid $2 a day and dinky engine operators $2.40 a day, a difference of $.40 between skilled and unskilled labor. At present the mines are not being worked very much, therefore, the need for labor is nil.",
                "When these mines are really worked to capacity there will be a need for thousands of workers and these towns will undergo a marvelous development. In consequence, the Committee is of the opinion that Colbert County is assured of a great industrial future and that this land will, in time, be worth more than the original price. However, at present, the lots cost more than their actual worth. Consequently the Committee is advising against the purchase of these lands for farming and gives the Council the task of informing Mr. Phinn of its decision.",

                "There, Mr. Consul! I hope that you will judge impartially what I shall modestly indite. And so, Mr. Consul, a few years ago there was a small colony of Arabs at the northeast corner of Polk and Canal streets in this city. I must admit that they were much better civilized than the Italians both hygienically and morally, for in my walks through that neighborhood, on weekdays and Sundays, I could not help noticing the neat and clean appearance of the men and the women. The elegance of their dress and their clean houses attracted the admiration of all passersby. Do I make myself clear, Mr. Consul? Very well! Two blocks away from the Arabs lived then andlive now our highly civilized Italian compatriots, of that race which is now trying to bestow its civilization on Lybia and Tripoli, and I think that it would be very interesting to compare the two races and to determine which has the greater need of being civilized.",
                "The following facts are a matter of common knowledge. When it comes to dirt and filth the Italian is unsurpassed, and I am well acquainted with a number of families that are, to say the least, disgusting. I shall describe one family which was known to me personally because it was from my native province of Calabria, the Africa of Italy. My friend, the master of the house, an honest and sober worker, had a four-room flat which sheltered him, his wife, two daughters, and five boarders. Other occupants were six rabbits which left their feces all over the house. Under the bed in the living-room were piled old shoes and rags which the wife and daughters had picked up in the streets and alleys, and which were to be used for fuel in the coming winter.",
                "The description of this family would fit thousands of others.",
                "And so, Mr. Consul, can you who have been to Africa, say that you have seen anything to compare with this? I am sure that you have not. Everyone knows that these conditions are found only among us. Further than that, the less said about our blood feuds, the better. In regard to religious superstition one needs to live in the Italian quarter in order to see the nauseating spectacle of the indecent peasantry which with its lousy saints and madonnas is the laughing-stock of Americans.",
                "And who is to blame for these conditions? The Italian Government and the House of Savoy, which in fifty years have done nothing but create misery and misfortune. Furthermore, do you know that in this country there is no one who bothers himself about these unfortunate countrymen of ours?",

Therefore as Italians who have the honor of our nationality at heart, we thank the good American press in general and the Inter-Ocean in particular.",

The Italians in Chicago, contrary to what the president of the Local Humane Society has said, have done their best to suppress those evils. At this point it is not improper to mention that the Italians here have promoted and seconded the movement in favor of the Compulsory Educational Law. The late Charles Kozminski consented to be their mouthpiece in the Board of Education. That sterling man brought their grievances before the Board with regard to the fact that swarms of Italian children were allowed to grow wild on the public streets, and this was the \"parva-favilla,\" that ignited the fire-works of the Compulsory Education, which has now ended like any fire-works display, leaving everything in darkness as before.",

Four years ago they held a mass meeting and collected from among themselves nearly $400 for this purpose. At that meeting a committee composed of fourteen Italians was appointed and charged to do the lobby work. A prominent lawyer was engaged to direct the work legally, and the desired ordinances were passed.",
                "But they were enforced a week or a trifle over that, and then were dropped because the rag-pickers were voters and consequently, under the protection of their ward politicians. Furthermore, the Italians have morally and materially helped Miss Jane Addams and Miss Helen Starr, the founders of that unique institution of Chicago, Hull House, and the above mentioned noble ladies can testify to this effect.",

M. the king of Italy, in Chicago, has been called upon by certain parties who have asked him to cooperate for the above mentioned purpose.",

                "To the ever increasing number of Italian-Americans, who are venturing out into the world, the question of choosing a profession which shall be both remunerative and consistent with their likes and dislikes is a very difficult one. The problem is made more acute because of an inadequate comprehension of just what the word \"profession\" embraces, and just what other fields are open in addition to the over-crowded field of law and medicine. Time has brought no abatement in the number of young men seeking to become doctors or lawyers, while other and oftentimes more attractive, if not more lucrative professions, are sadly in need of new talent.",
                "Perhaps the principal reason for the glamour surrounding the professions of law and medecine is the legendary respect inculcated in the hearts of our immigrants for those professions in Italy. In the small communities of the old country, where most of our immigrants come from, the lawyers and the doctors represented the highest leadership and commanded the greatest respect. The business man, on the other hand, was considered a lower order in the social scale, until recently young men in Italy, who could afford an education, invariably entered these professions.",
                "The immigrant seeks to do for his child in America what for lack of means he could not do for himself in Italy; make him a lawyer or a doctor in keeping with tradition.",
                "Much of this that might be called sentimental attachment for the two professions, the only professions in the minds of many, is still noticeable and many mothers and fathers doggedly insist that their boy shall be a \"dottore\" or an \"avvocato\". The result has been an influx into those fields that has created some rather unfortunate conditions. Thousands of them earn little more, if as much as the average man with a good trade, and many more earn appreciably less than the go-getting business man. Many have impelled themselves only half trained into the practice of law or medicine and, along with the others of other nationalities, have induced a lowering of the standards all along the line. A reaction has been in the stiffening of requirements and qualifications and the tightening of bar and medical board examinations. Some of the applicants inadequately prepared and over-anxious to break through, fail and attribute their failure to prejudice against them on account of race. There may be some grounds to this charge, but it can not be made generally applicable.",
                "Later phases of psychology, dealing especially with vocational guidance, promise to help a great deal in pointing out to the ambitious young man the right road; but science must first have a tilt with superstition if the historical glamour of medicine and law, as it affects the Italian, is to be destroyed. Of course, we need new talent coming into these professions, but it must be regulated in proportion to its value. The multiplicity of American life, its variegated industrial and business activities, offer many interesting and remunerative lines of endeavor to young men.",
                "There is need of more Italians in the field of journalism, social service, engineering, and the various commercial fields. These fields have been elevated to the dignity of a profession and, after all, the greatest profession in America is neither law nor medicine, but business.",
                "The great majority of American young men is going into business. Our Italian youth should follow their example."

Conquest by the sword is a devastating cyclone that leaves nothing but desolation in its wake. The conquest of the new hemisphere, accomplished without the spilling of blood, was a gift the benefit of which we revalue in new ways with the passing of years.

The magic of the future civilization lies in one word, \"love.\"",

The firm is occupying a part of the first floor and all of the upper three floors, in this way giving themselves several times the floor space available at the old Halsted Street premises, resulting in a sweeping improvement of service.

Its business has been established for upwards of a quarter of a century. By careful attention to the details of the business the management has, by up-to-date and efficient methods, honorable dealing, and by handling only quality products, made their concern one of the most successful and prosperous firms in the country handling the same class of products. It has a reputation second-to-none for fair dealing and high quality, as well as for the excellent service dispensed to the trade. The firm's trade, which has been increasing at a rapid rate during recent years, is not limited to the local field by any means, for it carries on a large shipping business with points far from this city, supplying many large grocers, delicatessen stores and dealers.",

The 360 Italian mutual benefit and social groups of Chicago, have made a proposal to erect a building which will serve as a rendezvous for meetings, entertainments and as a forum, such as the Ancient Greeks erected.",

The macaroni exports from Italy were curtailed because of the war, making it necessary for Italian colonies to set up macaroni factories in the principal Italian centers. The quality of the product gradually improved and today it is possible to compete with the best macaroni manufactured in Italy.",

It is well known that Chicago is the industrial center of America and perhaps of the world; it is also known that Armour and Company have under consideration the expansion of their grain capacity in order to compete with Italian made macaroni.",
                "Armour & Company has all the means at its command to crush any competitor in this matter, but the principal factor in obtaining success is the quality of the dough, the secret of which is known only to the Italian macaroni manufacturer.",
                "It will be useful for the Italian manufacturers to learn that the danger of being crushed by Armour's competition will be averted only by uniting, otherwise Armour may employ in its shops skilful Italian macaroni makers, thus succeeding in its competing with the domestic and foreign product.",
                "A union of Italian macaroni macaroni manufacturers of America cannot harm the Italian exports, because, as soon as the use of macaroni spreads among Americans, especially now that American doctors are recommending its use, thousands of Americans and Italian manufacturers will not suffice to supply the need of this great market.",

As I said before, I would like to show you a good financial condition in the Chamber, but we should congratulate ourselves on the really important results of our institution, if it wasn't for the European War, causing, at the present time, such unsettled conditions.

                "The writer states, \"It is a general error for the Italian exporting firms to think that if we have need of them and their products, it is necessary for us to go to Italy.\" It is really a serious error.",
                "We think that foreign firms which are in need of our merchandise should come to Italy to buy it, and our exporters wait idly for business to come to them. It is pitiful that even the more important firms remain inert and are doing nothing to expand their commerce and take advantage of the opportunity offered them a few months ago, soon after the start of the war.",
                "I know that in the the United States, the Americans buy only such products which cannot be found elsewhere, and we are sure that they always prefer the products of any other nation but Italy not excluding Japan, which, in the last few years, has absorbed some of the Italian business in the United States.",
                "It is wrong to believe that it is only necessary to have a good salesman to do a large business. It means nothing if the business is not repeated because the customer was not satisfied with the quality or price of the products sold. They must know the needs and the Customs of every country and the psychology of its people to establish a permanent success.",
                "Our industrialists have produced different articles suitable for the European and South American markets but absolutely unfitted for the United States because of the different economic conditions of this country and because the Americans are accustomed to paying cash and buying what they want instead of accepting what is, offered them.",
                "The old saying \"When in Rome, do as the Romans do\" should be the slogan of our exporters if they intend to penetrate and establish their commercial connections in this market.",
                "Our exporters must study seriously the various markets and send their best products at the best prices with convenient terms for payment. We should also initiate an advertising campaign, sending catalogues and correspondence in the language of the country with which they are dealing.",
                "In the United States, advertising must be done on a large scale, because when you try to sell products to the Americans, they do not ask: How good are they, but how well are they advertised?",
                "They also expect well-packed articles because they believe in the attractive appearance of the package.",
                "Thus we recommend to exporters good products, well-packed, at convenient terms, and well advertised to insure the success and stability of their products."

                "\"Thanksgiving Day was truly a day of thanksgiving for Salvatore Bruno of Hammond, Indiana, who received a check for $250 from Attorney Rocco De Stefano. He had despaired of ever seeing a cent of that money, and could not believe his eyes when a check was handed to him covering the entire amount.",
                "\"Another depositor, who was paid in full is Gaspare Scurto, 171 North La Salle street. He came personally to the office of this newspaper to show us the check for $157 and to thank us for printing the news that the heirs of De Stefano were paying their creditors.\"",
                "We are moved to wonder why the heirs waited so long to honor the memory of their father. Why was not Gaspare Scurto paid when he requested payment at the time of the elder De Stefano's death? And what of the nineteen years' interest, which at three per cent adds up to quite a sum?",
                "And now a few words to the workers, especially to those unfamiliar with the English language. How many times must we warn you not to deposit money in these small private Italian banks which are likely to close their doors at any moment and leave you in squalid misery and tears of regret? That is what happened to the depositors of the De Stefano bank nineteen years ago. De Scurto, at the time, contemplated returning to Italy and could not go because the money was in the hands of the De Stefano heirs, who put him off from day to day with useless promises when he asked for his money.",
                "Do not allow yourselves to be caught in the same trap. Draw out your savings from these Italian banks, or like G. Scurto you will weep bitter tears."

Muggia, S. Gillette, L. Caravetta, trustees, held a special meeting and resolved to close the Chamber of Commerce's offices next Saturday, as a token of respect for the beloved Maestro Campanini, who was one of the greatest personalities of modern Italy.",

At this point the good \"old man,\" Tommaso, interrupts to say that he is not seeking a scholar for his daughter, but a husband.",
                "Thus true love, sanctioned by the \"old man,\" wins out, and the play ends happily for all except the mother and the disappointed teacher."

Now that the war has created different conditions, the need is felt for union musicians. Those who were compelled to resign have asked to be reinstated and this will be approved without delay, in order to fill vacancies left by those who have gone to war.

                "Charming Nannetta, however, promptly divulges the true story of the sandal, to save her mother from a false accusation. At the same time she publicly avows her love for Nardino.",
                "The mother flies into a rage, while the teacher insists upon knowing why Nannetta took such a long time to choose between himself, an educated man, and Nardino, a peasant. At this point the good \"old man,\" Tommaso, interrupts to say that he is not seeking a scholar for his daughter, but a husband.",
                "Thus true love, sanctioned by the \"old man,\" wins out, and the play ends happily for all except the mother and the disappointed teacher."

What might seem a mere threat is a well-known fact, which can be fully attested by Cav. A. Ferrari, an intimate friend of the above-mentioned Royal Italian Consul. One evening, in the studio of the Cannata brothers, Mr. Ferrari had the nerve to call Dr. Volini a swindler. What then escaped my lips I do not remember, but I can now say that I knew mighty well both Dr. Volini and Cav. Ferrari.",

                "Only an immigrant, one who has for years after his arrival been a stranger to language and customs of the country, can fully understand and appreciate the part that the newspapers printed in his own tongue plays in acquainting him with conditions adopted in this adopted country of his. It may seem a paradox that a newspaper is of far greater practical value to the newcomer than any books from which he might have acquired whatever amount of education he possesses, but it is nevertheless true. In fact, the fellow who has spent many a night-hour trying to put into polished phrases a chapter from Xenephon is no better off, as far as the practical value of his learning is concerned, than the fellow who comes from the peak of the mountains and cannot write script but must print his letters. Both, although coming from the opposite stations in life are bounced into the midst of an unfamiliar turmoil, in which they find themselves on the same level, that is, unable to express themselves in words of the new tongue which is spoken everywhere about them, and if left to find their way alone, unable even to satisfy their most imperative wants. The natural result of this plight, in which all foreigners find themselves at their arrival, is the tendency to settle where others of their nationality have already settled, thus forming those characteristic little foreign colonies in American towns, which for the better and the younger element, are like ante-rooms where their acquisition of the English language and their assimilation of American customs are little by little prepared and accomplished and from which they will, sooner or later, step out into the larger life of the town and become units of the true American population. The older set, or the purely migratory element, either fossilizes in these segregated communities or returns to the homeland after a more or less protracted stay here.",
                "It is during this period of incubation, among the members of these communities, that the foreign-language newspaper plays its most important and lasting educational part. The newspaper becomes then for the immigrated, not merely an agency of information concerning the happenings in the old country, but a unique practical, almost automatic teacher of American ways, American laws, and American institutions. Because a foreigner exhibits knowledge, for instance, of American juridical procedure or political organization or what-not, it does not argue that that foreigner has received school instruction on such topics, or that he must necessarily have been in court, or have voted. Nor could any manual or newspaper be found which treats these subjects in an academic way. All that a foreigner comes to know about his new country, he absorbs from reading the varied happenings of each day in the newspaper printed in his own tongue. Today it may be the news concerning the strike of the street-cleaners that teaches him about labor organization and that particular branch of the city administration. Tomorrow, by reading a sensational case he will come to understand the functions and the mode of procedure of our courts.",
                "In this respect the lawyer from Italy who might possibly have edited a newspaper there, needs to read the newspaper here as much as does the mountaineer from Albania, who perhaps never saw a newspaper-man in his country. A tangible evidence of how indispensable is the newspaper to the foreigner in America is the extent to which the newspaper of each nationality circulated among the people of that nationality. Every literate foreigner is a constant and attentive reader of the journals in his own tongue. Of course it is to be expected, at such times as during the recent Turkish-Italian war, and during the present Balkan war, that the members of the races involved who are residing in this country should be led by their patriotism to a closer scrutiny of the news that usual. Hence an abnormal increase in the circulation of the Italian newspapers in the United States during the war of their mother country with Turkey, amounted to no more than thirty per cent; which is small enough considering the vital and enthusiastic interest with which the Italians here followed every step of the conflict's progress.",
                "As an educational factor, the advertisements in foreign-language newspapers are also of invaluable assistance to the newcomer. There are a lot of wants that he begins to feel after being here a short while, and while at first it is the suggestion of a friend or relative that makes the newcomer adapt himself to a certain branch or quality of goods, the time comes when he feels the necessity of making his own choice in order to satisfy his own taste. Here is where the new arrival turns to newspapers for help, with a confidence which made him, up to four or five years ago, an easy prey of the sharks and the crooks.",
                "But even the advertising of the foreign-language newspapers is now becoming standardized. The readers are warned through editorials to discriminate in their purchases and preferably to look for trade-marks or trade names of established reputation. Thus the time is not far off when foreign-language newspapers will be as reliable and educating in their advertisements as they are at present in their news."

                "Its author, Prof. Francesco Ventresca, who has been a silent but a powerful factor in moulding such a history, in this autobiography not only has weaved a magnificent tapestry of facts and events of which he was a spectator and participant, but has poured into this work his whole heart and his vast culture, so as to make it one of the outstanding literary creations of the season.",
                "And the book not only is a classic, as far as the English language is concerned, but it is also a hymn of thanksgiving to life by a man who has learned through faith and work how to appreciate it and how to use it to his and humanity's best advantage.",
                "J. G. Fucilla, professor of Romance languages at Northwestern University, in complimenting Professor Ventresca on his wonderful achievement, among other things, wrote: \"Among the other admirable traits that you display, I have been struck by your militant idealism and your patriotism. You have demonstrated to a skeptical world that it is possible to be at once a good American citizen and a lover of the land of glorious achievements, the land of your forefathers, Italy.",
                "For too many young people of Italian extraction, especially in their misguided zeal to become quickly assimilated, have not only deliberately blotted out the brilliant traditions which belong to them, but what is worse, they have come, in some cases, to nourish a strange and implacable hatred toward them; gaining nothing tangible by such an attitude, they have deprived themselves at the same time of that element that would contribute most to make their cultured life richer and more worthwhile.\"",
                "As a scholar, teacher, traveler and gentleman, Prof. Francesco Ventresca has contributed very much to elevate the prestige of the Italians in America, and in recognition of his contribution to the common cause, the Italians in America should read his book which, after all, is their book."

The simplicity of the narrative carries conviction.",

They predominate among the produce merchants, and in proportion to their number as a whole, predominate in the grocery and restaurant business. They excel in the production of fine pastry and make excellent bread.",

They have been instrumental in levelling class differences in the United States, for it is they who have brought it about that well-cut trim looking garments are no longer the perogative of the well-to-do.",
                "The Selected Directory does not however pretend to list all Italians engaged in business. The biographical studies show that of the firms belonging to several members, some Italians have taken over American firms and these firms, founded by Americans, could not be listed. As Italian there finally remains to be listed the great number of Italians who hold important executive offices in Italian and in American firms.",

This book, which the Society intends to place in every library, university and high school of this country, will aim to rectify the false impressions of those who, in their ignorance, have not as yet learned to appreciate the worth of our race and the gigantic contribution of the Italians to America. It aims to render justice to our nationality, which for too long a period has been unjustly scorned and underestimated by those who seek favor from the people who are our hosts; and to arouse a justifiable sense of pride of race among the young Italo-Americans who were born and raised in America.",

They must, without distinction, create among themselves a solid spiritual alliance (product of their universal political unison), and establish, as a fundamental principle of justice - inviolate and invincible - that when a controversy between two nations degenerates into war, each of the peoples not involved in the controversy so fostered, must impose upon their own government an armed intervention in favor of the nation which one finds in the right. In the right, according to the judgment that springs free from preconceived ideas and passions, from free intelligence, from the candid conscience of the people themselves, and above all, according to the natural guide of life which makes the cause of the oppressed seem always beautiful, sacred, and worthy of victory.",
                "Only in such a manner, for the present, can one curb the aggressive mania of the stronger. Only in such a manner can war be prevented.",

Other editions followed in May, 1920, in Italian; in November, 1921, and in May, 1922, in English. Both pamphlets were published in Chicago.",
                "Then in March, 1924, Luigi Carnovale again republished his conception against neutrality in another pamphlet, in catechistical form (questions and answers) under the title, How America Can Easily And Quickly Prevent War Forever. In this edition he set forth his conception in still clearer and more precise terms, in the following three questions and answers:",
                "(1). How can the United States abolish neutrality?",
                "The President of the United States should officially proclaim the principle itself in the form of an appropriate article in the American Constitution.",
                "The United States Government should invite all the other nations of the world to do the same; that is, to proclaim officially the principle of the abolition of neutrality, and to introduce the relative article into their own constitutions.",
                "(2). How must the article establishing the abolition of neutrality be formulated?",
                "It must be formulated in these terms: When in a part of the world a controversy (in words) arises between two nations, the United States and all the other nations not involved in the controversy, instead of remaining indifferent, which means neutral, must immediately and officially sympathize with the nation which is in the right and at the same time stigmatize the nation which is in the wrong.",
                "If the two nations in controversy pass from words to acts, which means war, the United States and all the other neutral nations must immediately intervene in the war in defense of the nation which is in the right, and intervene with economic and armed forces of land, sea, and air, instantly, to defeat and annihilate the insolent nation which is in the wrong and has provoked the war.",
                "It is understood, of course, that in all cases the stronger nation must intervene against the nation which is in the wrong and has provoked the war. But the weaker nation must necessarily be in the right, it being impossible, excepting in case of insanity, that the weaker should insolently attack the stronger. The lamb cannot insolently attack the wolf!",
                "At any rate, the neutral nations must always intervene in favor of the nation which is in the right, whether this nation be the weaker or the stronger.",
                "The principle of intervention of the neutral in favor of the side which is right, and against the side which is wrong, is also applicable to civil wars.",
                "The article establishing the abolition of neutrality to be introduced into the Constitution of the United States must be identical to the one to be introduced into the constitutions of all the other nations because the object of the United States and that of all the other nations of the world is identical. It is the end of war and the practical advent of universal, permanent peace.",
                "(3). What is the Locarno Security Pact?",
                "In substance it is the official recognition and proclamation on the part of the great European nations of Luigi Carnovale's original conception, \"the abolition of neutrality.\"",
                "It is true the objection might be raised that the Locarno Pact covers only a few nations, whereas Luigi Carnovale's plan covers all the nations of the world; but, it is also true that the Locarno Pact is the decisive step toward universal permanent peace and which will certainly be followed sooner or later by all the other nations of the world."

For that purpose various societies were organized, such as: \"The League of Nations,\" \"The World Court,\" and \"Alliance Negotiations.\"",

Dissension between peoples or nations pursue its way undisturbed and often culminates in armed conflict, violent and ruinous. The blood of our brothers has flowed like streams until now, despite the numerous formulas and remedies devised to obtain universal peace. It is necessary, then, to try other means and formulas.",
                "Luigi Carnovale, a rare genius, dedicated himself to the humanitarian cause and worked out a formula for abolishing war which seems astonishingly good. The basic principle of his formula, the theory proposed by him and treated thoroughly in his pamphlet How America Can Easily And Quickly Prevent Wars Forever, is as follows:",
                "\"The elimination of neutrality, only, can quickly and forever stop war. What is the elimination of neutrality? It is 'human solidarity' against neutrality, which is an act of cruel collective egotism which perpetually encourages war. Human solidarity is a 'strong spiritual alliance' of all peoples. It means to establish as a basic principle, that when a controversy which arises between two nations is resolved into a war, every nation not involved must intervene with its army in favor of the oppressed nation, which stands on the side of reason in accordance with the judgment of the people, free of prejudice.\"",
                "But somebody might object.\"Can the people decide and put into execution this human solidarity?\" \"Certainly,\" says Mr. Carnovale. \"The masses of the people are free and powerful. They are impartial and generous. They can impose their will on the government.\"",

He then went on to say that his knowledge of California was first hand since he had covered the entire state on foot. He spoke of California as being mostly desert, with here and there an oasis, and that the pressing need was for irrigation, over which the government should concern itself. He gave a picture of the Italian Colony at Asti, and of the conditions of the vineyard workers in that locality, which one gathered, were hardly pleasant. He counselled any one who has in mind moving to California, to reconsider, asserting that California would feel the effects of the San Francisco disaster for another twenty-five years.",

                "The Italo-American National Union was founded thirty-one years ago in Chicago by a small group of immigrants from Sicily for the purpose of mutual assistance in case of sickness, and for the payment of a mortuary benefit to the widows and orphans of a deceased member. The Italians in Chicago in the early days were counted only by the hundreds which made it imperative for them, as people of other nationalities have done in this country, to unite and form societies, where they could go occasionally to spend a few pleasant hours of their time with their kind, and with whom they had a common language and interest.",
                "Young Man Take Hold",
                "In 1922, after twenty-five years of life, during which time the organization had had its ups and downs, like similar societies, but during which period it had contributed morally and materially to the upbuilding of the Italians of Chicago through its social and charitable activities, due to a lack of foresight in its officers, the society found itself with but 600 demoralized members and unable to meet its obligations. It was then that a group of the younger members. the more Americanized, asked to be given an opportunity to adopt the system and changes they had advocated to the older element. The younger men were given their opportunity and they made good since at the end of 1922 the members had risen from 600 to 2,000 and the assets to $32,000, after clearing a $3,000 deficit for 1921.",
                "Officers Held to Task",
                "Today, due to the good work of the officers elected in 192, who are still in office, having been elected for five consecutive terms, the Italo-American National Union has a membership of  36 lodges thoroughly organized to spread the gospel of fraternalism among the Italians in America.",
                "This is the only Italian organization with a juvenile department, that has a deposit with the State of Illinois of $100,000, and the only scientifically managed fraternal insurance society among the Italians in the United States. This organization has never been second in extending help to unfortunates, and it gave generously to the fund for the Southern Illinois cyclone, and Florida hurricane sufferers, besides on many previous occasions.",
                "The Supreme officers are: Judge B. P. Barasa, president; Constantino Vitello, vice-president; P. Scaduto, secretary; V. E. Ferrara, treasurer; and T. H. Landise, and other successful professional and business men of this city, respected for their integrity and standing. Last, but not least, this society teaches and inculcates true Americanism to its members, through a monthly publication."

To you, therefore, falls the responsibility of reviving this useful organization, not only because it is Italian, but because it was initiated by your superior, our Ambassador to Washington.",
                "As you can see for yourself, the Society is losing ground every day. You aware of the fiasco which resulted from this year's dance given in the Auditorium Hotel's most aristocratic ballroom. Despite the most extensive newspaper publicity carried on for two months up to the date of the dance; despite the arduous work of the committee, composed of the most prominent women in the colony, it was a veritable fiasco. Of one hundred and twenty-five thousand Italians in Chicago, only two hundred and fifty attended and that number included the members and their families. So, actually, only about one hundred outsiders attended.",
                "Nevertheless, the newspaper L'Italia boldly reported that the attendance reached the five hundred mark and that it was a great success, of which the colony could well be proud.",
                "One should, it is true, encourage beneficent institutions, but they must be institutions with a serious program, and led by capable persons. In our colony, especially among the women, that element is missing. We have good mothers, good housekeepers, but for administering a society, we have no one.",
                "The newspaper L'Italia is fully aware of this, but dares not mention it--for fear, perhaps, of losing subscribers.",
                "Therefore, Mr. Consul, if you do not wish to see this Society disappear, do as I advise, without considering the fact that the advice comes from the [minority] in our colony. I advise you to enter as a member, to bring in with you others of good will, and to try to persuade the brave women that the best thing for the organization is to ally itself with an American charitable organization--for in doing that, it would be acting for its own good."

The institution, while primarily for the benefit of Italians, will be open to all people irrespective of nationality or religion. The Italian societies of the city are interested and have promised a considerable sum of money. A site for the proposed building that finds much favor is at Crawford Avenue and Twelfth Street. It is hoped that ground may be broken and the building fairly started in about six months. A concert for the benefit of the hospital fund was given in Kimball Hall last night. David A. Dasso gave his services as manager and secured the voluntary aid of some of the best musical talent in the city. Eliodore de Campri was the accompanist and a committee of Italian ladies aided in securing the success of the concert. A handsome sum was realized from the sale of tickets. It is proposed to give another entertainment of like nature in the near future."

They taught them how to properly care for their babies, how to keep a clean house, and in certain cases actually got down on their knees and scrubbed floors. All this was done without any fanfare and without asking for contributions from those whom they helped. And not one of the wealthier Italians of the colony offered financial aid to this deserving institution. Now, Mr. Consul, show me one Italian welfare association that has done these things in the past or is doing them now. Show me one pious lady or gentleman who has encouraged this institution of true charity and progress. No one has, except perhaps, Alessandro Mastro-Valerio, who in truth has been the one and only patriot to concern himself with our misfortunes, and has always tried, by his own efforts, to ameliorate the conditions of the Italian colonists. He has taken a leading part in the activities of Hull House, and with Miss Jane Addams has done everything in his power to improve living conditions in the colony.",
                "But all this did not find favor with the prominent people in the colony or with the pious ladies; nor did it interest the hundred or so societies, because they are too ignorant to understand. If it were some religious institution, like the one of the Consolato on via Monza in Milan, where that despicable Don Riva with the help of Sister Fumagalli raped seven little girls (the oldest nine years and the youngest three) and infected them with syphilis, for which crime Italian justice sentenced him to sixteen years in jail and the pious sister to nine months; if it were such an institution, you can rest assured it would have received the support of the colony's best element, consisting of doctors, lawyers and pious ladies who with their fables would have been of great help to the holy enterprise because, as you know, they would indirectly profit by it. For this reason they prefer darkness to our colony's enlightenment. They have made every attempt to block any improvement in our people's living conditions.",
                "What is the difference between Miss Jane Addams and the better element in our colony? I'll illustrate.",
                "That dear and cultured friend, Prof. Giuseppe Vecchione, called together a group of musicians and formed an orchestra, making himself the leader. From the moment of its founding this organization has had to combat the petty hatred of those in the colony who are the first to oppose cultural advancement. These persons have done their utmost to break up the orchestra.",

They saw, with pleasure, the Italians neglecting Hull House, and accepted with joy the coming of the priest, with whom they could make common cause. That is, all except Mastro-Valerio.",

He looked like a beggar a year ago!\" \"Don't you know?

He has previously corresponded with some company that is building a railroad line, a bridge, a tunnel, or an aqueduct and wants laborers shipped to some distant solitary place, to be supervised by slave-driving bosses, far from the surveillance of the law.",

The agencies promise steady work in the country, where it costs little to live, and where there is less of opportunity to spend money. Our poor countrymen usually congregate at the agencies in groups of five, six, ten, twenty, or fifty, forming the so-called \"ghenga\". They feel the need of mutual advice, assistance, and protection. The owner of the agency and his clerk welcome them in the friendliest, most fatherly manner, He makes them believe that he has rejected two or three, hundred Slavs or Greeks in order to reserve the good jobs for Italians. And what fine jobs! Two dollars a day, nine hours of light, easy work, the purest air, distilled water, free board, Italian boss, low cost of living, - an Eldorado! They must decide quickly, for few vacancies are left, and they must be filled by this evening or to-morrow morning.",

                "To raise the money, some suggest selling watches or overcoats or taking a collection. Their spokesman announces to the agent that all are ready to leave. From now on the agent becomes the gang's most humble servant. For their convenience he has the baggage of the newly-enrolled laborers brought to the agency. He explains to them the route of the journey; he buys their railroad tickets, accompanies them personally to the station and to their cars, and sometimes even goes with them or sends some one else, to the location. His earnings have not been meager. A gang of 12 men, who pay as \"bossatura\" $5 each, yields $60; $2 discount on each railroad ticket makes $24 more; $2 paid for each worker by the hiring company makes another $24; -- a total of $108!",

The \"free\" board is prepared and served in a wooden shed or in an old railroad car owned by the boss or by the company. If they want the job, the men must eat and sleep there, paying what is demanded. The meals are prepared of stuff which hogs would scorn to eat. The beds consist of a handful of damp and stinking straw. The \"purest air\" usually means the deadly miasma of swamp-land, where mosquitoes absorb what little blood has been left by the bosses and the employment agents. The \"light, easy work\" consists of ten or eleven hours of shoveling under a broiling sun or tunneling the bowels of a mountain. The \"Italian boss\" turns out to be a Turkish, Russian, or Irish slave-driver who does not understand the men and is not understood by them, who begrudges them even the time that it takes to blow a nose, and who easily reaches the point of kicking and sometimes even of shooting.",
                "After a few days of torture the men begin to consider means of escape, or sometimes they agree upon some form of mutiny. But since the agent has prepaid the transportation charges, and the company must withhold that money from their wages, the men are in debt; they must pay, and therefore they must continue to work, willy-nilly. Besides, all habitations are far away, and the police will always stand by the bosses, without admitting any protest or defense on the part of the men, who run the risk of being jailed if they stop working.",
                "Here are some real and hypothetical cases. A laborer is hired to leave New York or Chicago for a job location in the North; instead, he is shipped south. Last year eight Italians hired in Chicago, ostensibly for a job in the State of Washington, were sent on a sail-boat, under pretext of haste, to fish off the banks of Newfoundland, in polar temperature, with roasted fish as their only food.

Vitello, our Supreme President, a meeting of the Supreme Council was held and after a brief discussion it was unanimously resolved to go to the assistance of the earthquake sufferers with 100,000 lire. A form letter was sent to the 51 lodges of the Union, inviting all members to contribute $1 each for this humanitarian cause and, in less than one week, the amount requested was collected. The lodges, composed in most part by workingmen, responded to the appeal with patriotic and fraternal spirit. A check for 100,000 lire, issued by the Banco di Napoli, was made out in the name of the head of the Italian government to whom it will be given personally by C. Vitallo, our Supreme President, who is going to Italy."

Why do they become criminals here? There is something rotten in Denmark, we mean to say there is something wrong, not in being Sicilian, but in living in Chicago.",
                "Now what are the underlying connections of our association with crime? None. If any newspaper or any private source of information can disprove this statement we are willing to cooperate with them to render everything public, and submit to the decision of any court of law. We have voted and deposited in the hands of the city authorities $1,000 for the ones who will bring to justice the offenders of the law and humanity in the Ranieri case.",
                "People who are offenders, unfortunately, may belong to our organization as to any other fraternal order or association existing in the country, the American Legion, Elks, Moose, etc. What of it? Since they pay their dues and keep their place as far as their relation with the organization is concerned, investigation of their private life is a police affair.",
                "Our association, founded June 10th, 1895, is a benevolent one. It pays an insurance at the death of a member, it pays most of their bills when sick and in need. The aim of our association is to promote a true and friendly understanding between Italy and America and to help Italian immigrants become thoroughly good American citizens. Our worth is shown by the ever increasing number of members and their willingness in contributing to any and every one of our humanitarian enterprises.",
                "In fact we have paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to help the needy and the victims of national disaster, calamities, cataclysms and war. We take hold of the new immigrants and become their guarantors and sponsors in getting them started in this nation, new to them, so that they will not be victimized by professional bloodsuckers or deviated from a straight life.",

Any connection with crime, besides being repulsive to us, would be disastrous to our organization. We ask not to be believed such fools as not to understand this much.",

We wish every one could have read what the Italian consul wrote or said in his statement and we say that Mussolini did not play politics or sensationalism or sold extras.",
                "He did not even collect fees from criminals' bribes to keep his hands off. He did not even intimidate judges to obstruct justice. He did not wash his hands when it came to defend the safety of jurymen or witnesses. He did not even accuse any association.",

                "The executor of such crimes as kidnaping, extortion, bombing, \"taking for a ride,\" is a secondary personage as far as justice is concerned.",
                "It is common knowledge that the executors are hired men. If you prosecute and convict them the same party that hired them will find many more fools to be hired. It is the \"higher ups\" that should be apprehended and brought to justice. It is the judge, allowing bail, who gives them a chance to avenge themselves by killing the witness, or gives them time to create a fund, through extortion for their defense.",
                "When a common offender is brought to court and hires a lawyer whose fee runs into the thousands of dollars, why not go and find the source of this money? Then our slanderous critics would have nothing to say against the Italo-American National Union. They would have to admit that much of the cause of the crime situation in Chicago lies in the local public institutions and in the local system.",
                "Then they might be surprised to find that those who cry the loudest are implicated in the crime.",
                "We say to our slanderous critics: \"Let us be honest and frank and cooperate in thorough spirit of reform for the welfare of humanity. Do not accuse others unjustly to shade yourself. Let us do something constructive and not destructive. Show us that besides lies and false braggings you really can do something.\"",
                "To stand this vexing propaganda would harm us twice; would destroy our good reputation, would make people believe that we are accomplices in crime.",
                "Patience, tolerance, magnanimity on our part, would be a crime of innoble suicide. That is unthinkable."

On the ground, not far from Gattuso's bedroom window and easily traced by a path of blood in the snow, police found the footprint of a man who was identified as A. Puelo or Pilo, 26 years old, living at 510 N. Wells. A few steps away they found the blood-stained pick with which it is believed Gattuso was struck while asleep. Andrea Caffaro, brother-in-law of Gattuso, wounded in the shooting fray was arrested in his home at 5960 W. Chicago Avenue. The police are also searching for Giovanni Caffaro, brother of Andrea, and for Antonio Gasparo, a barber.",

Since then he had changed his residence, hoping in that manner to elude the enemies who had been threatening him and demanding money since he is a retired well-to-do fruit merchant.",

Gattuso, although taken unawares had the presence of mind to snatch the revolver which he kept under his pillow and start firing at random while his assailants kept striking with knives. Poli, it seems, was fatally wounded but had enough strength to reach the window out of which he fell breaking his neck.",

Here is what happened: A little boy, unable to speak English, was met by a policeman freezing and crying. The friendly night policeman brought the boy to an Italian man, to help out as interpreter. The little one told, that his father had rented him out to Mallelo for twenty-five dollars a year. For that he was obliged to walk daily through the streets with his harp on his back and play music. The money thus collected he had to give to his cruel master in the evening. It was too bad for him if he did not hand over a minimum amount to his torturer. He was then beaten and received nothing to eat. Often he was sent out again into the dark night to complete the sum. If he was again unsuccessful he had to look for another shelter or sleep in the open.",

This is wrong. These same newspapers give the impression that many wrongs are attributable to prohibition. When these wrongs are analized they have nothing whatever to do with prohibition. The press sometimes maintains that crimes are committed by men affiliated with a certain religious demonination. As a matter of fact, that conviction of theirs is also wrong. A person may be baptised in one faith, but if he grows to manhood and pays no attention to the church and religious matters, it is not fair that any bad in him should be charged to the denomination of his nationality. Then again, if a man is once a Catholic or a Jew that label remains with him throughout his lifetime; whereas, he may be baptised a Protestant, but if he does not attend the Protestant church he is soon dropped from such church roll.",

We do not intend, in the least, to defend those who have killed. The law must take its course and whether or not justice is done, is a matter that concerns the administrators of the law. We only ask that the editors of the Chicago newspapers accord the Italian people fair play; to refrain from attacking them in a group for the misdeeds of the few; to limit themselves to the cases as they happen without drawing into the vortex of crime, indiscriminately - men and institutions of the highest proven honor and integrity. Journalism must educate and not be prejudiced. The so-called \"scoops\" brought in by some quixotic reporter should be analyzed before being published; reporters should be instructed to bring in straight and correct information and not rubbish, for publication.",

If among them there are some who do not respect the law, it is perhaps because those who should see that the law is enforced, ensconce them.",

Sixty-six policemen were wounded, and six killed; four leaders of the working class were hanged, in spite of their innocence. Since then, all governments are afraid of revolution or some social catastrophe on May 1st, so they keep policemen and soldiers in readiness to subdue any attempt to revolt by the proletarian class.",

He had already been in the saloon for a few drinks, and perhaps in the exitement of what he was about to do, forgot his portfolio. Missing it at the station, he suspected that he had left it at the saloon, and hurried over with a police agent, then after peering through the door, he ran for the station.

                "While asleep in his room over the restaurant, Albertini was awakened by a noise at the front door, at 4 o'clock in the morning, December 25th. Thinking that thieves were breaking into the restaurant, he picked up a revolver and made his way in the dark to the head of the stairs. The street door had been forced open and in the dim light he saw two men ascending the stairs. He levelled the gun at them before he recognized their uniform, that of the Pinkerton Service. The two men took the gun away from Albertini and forced him to accompany them to the quarters of the Service where, while awaiting the arrival of the police patrol which had been summoned by one of them, they mercilessly beat upon Albertini. The arrival of the patrol wagon was really a Godsend for Albertini.",
                "In court the next day when asked to explain their presence in the restaurant at that hour of the morning, they gave the excuse that they had found the front door open and having gone in to investigate the possibility of a robbery, they had run into Albertini threatening them with a gun. Thinking that Albertini, who has the room over the restaurant with the proprietor's permission, and is there also for the purpose of keeping watch over the place at night, was the one who had broken into the place, they had valiantly disarmed and hauled him to jail.",

Emmanuel Mallelo an Italian living at 527 S. Clark Street, was subjected to a severe grilling in the South Side Police Station for alleged slave dealing in Italian children. Here is what happened: A little boy unable to speak English, freezing and crying, was met by a policeman, who brought him to an Italian man to help as an interpreter. The child said that his father had rented him out to Mallelo for $25 a year. He was forced to walk daily through the streets with a harp on his back and to play music. The money thus collected he had to give to his cruel master in the evening. It fared bad with him every time he did not hand over a certain minimum amount to his torturer. He was then beaten, received nothing to eat and forced out again into the dark night to complete the required sum. If he was again unsuccessful, he had to look for another shelter or sleep in the open.",
                "The court proceedings revealed that Mallelo was keeping eight boys in similar bondage. He gave the boys shelter and food for one dollar a week. Investigations are continuing. It is to be hoped that charitable people will be found to take care of the little Italian slaves."

Otherwise the reader only sees one side of the truth, (if the truth exists in Elizabeth Frazer's article), and it is upon this one and only side that he bases his opinion on the subject discussed by a careless and unjust writer.",
                "Elizabeth Frazer treats her subject in such a pessimistic way that she came to the conclusion, that immigrants, the Italian in particular, are absolutely unsusceptible to Americanization and to the assimilation. Consequently, in her conclusion she does not recognize in the immigrant in this country even the natural instinct of an animal towards its own betterment.",
                "I believe I know the Italian immigrants of the United States well enough, having studied their situation for a long time and having published a book covering my impressions entitled: \"The Journal of the Italian Immigrant in North America,\" (Chicago), therefore, I venture to set forth a few facts quite contrary to the foolish, misleading and slanderous assertions of Elizabeth Frazer.",
                "For instance, there are hundreds of thousands of Italians in the United States who are naturalized American citizens.",
                "In agriculture, the industries, in commerce, fiance, politics, sport, science, art and education, in fact, in all fields of American activity, the Italian immigrants have demonstrated in the past, and will demonstrate more and more, that they know how to Americanize themselves and assimilate to the fullest extent that which America offers them.",
                "Furthermore, the immigrants of today are not like the ones of the old days, to whom, no doubt, Elizabeth Frazer refers with such posthumus zeal.",

                "Commerce: South Water Street of Chicago, one of the wonders of Chicago and the most important wholesale fruit market in the United States, was established and developed to its present state by Italian immigrants and it is almost entirely in their hands. An Italian immigrant, Mr. Garibaldi, was for years and up to his death, President of the South Water Street wholesale merchants organization.",
                "Among the high grade confectioners in Chicago, the Allegretti Co., has enjoyed a splendid reputation for years.",
                "Finance: The greatest American Bank of the West from Chicago to California, is the Bank of Italy in San Francisco, established and developed to its present state by Italian immigrants and that bank is in their hands.

                "Among the Judges in Chicago there are three Italians, Barasa, Borelli, Gualano. Judge Barasa was also candidate for Mayor of Chicago during the last election. And in smaller American cities some of the Mayors are Italian.",
                "Science: The only American Pasteur Institute in Chicago is the one established and directed by the Italian, Dr. Lagorio. One of the best American hospitals in Chicago is the Columbus Hospital facing Lincoln Park, established and owned by Italians. The Italian, John B. Zingrone of Chicago is one of the greatest American X-ray operators. He was confidential assistant to the famous surgeon, Prof. J. B. Murphy, who appointed him to make the X-ray pictures of President Theodore Roosevelt.",
                "Art: The Italian, Count di Cesnola, was for years, up to his death, the Director of the Metropolitan Museum of New York. The two greatest American opera companies are in the hands of Italians, i.e., the New York Opera Company being directed by the Italian, Gatticasazza, and the Chicago Opera Company by the Italian, Maestro Polacco. Among the best American moving picture stars is the Italian, Rudolfo Valentino. There are many others. Not counting the myriads of American singers, music teachers, architects, sculptors, artists, who are of Italian blood. The architect of the Union Station of Chicago, now under construction and said to be the greatest railroad station in the world, is an Italian. The American inventor of artificial lightning is the Italian engineer, Mr. Faccioli.",
                "Professions: There are hundreds of Italians, naturalized American citizens, who are practicing law, hundreds of physicians as well as druggists.",
                "Sports: The American Golf champion is the Italian, Sarazene. The American champion of automobile racing is the Italian, De Palma. Among the American ring champions are the Italians, Dundee, Wilson, Gennaro and even Dempsey, who is of Italian descent.",
                "The American cowboy winner of the recent horse races at Harlem, New York, is the Italian, Tony Pagona. In swimming, running, bicycling and motorcycle racing, some of the best champions are Italians.",

                "Education: One of the greatest American educators is the Italian, Angelo Patri, not counting the numerous Catholic American educational institutions, (universities, colleges, high schools), in all parts of the United States, almost all established and directed by Italians. Dozens of professors in the American universities and colleges are Italians.",
                "In the high school examinations in New York City, two Italian boys, Bernard and Vincent Cioffari, exceeded by 5.03 and 3.77, respectively, the very highest average (92%) ever attained by anyone in the history of New York schools.",
                "I could mention many other facts to prove that the Italian immigrants desire and know how to Americanize themselves, that they desire and know how to assimilate the best America has to offer them by securing for themselves American positions of such importance, and in every field imaginable, as to be envied by those Americans whose individuality Elizabeth Frazer so highly praises. Such positions are attained by Italian immigrants notwithstanding the disadvantages they suffer due to the difference in language and, more than anything else, to the cruel prejudice held against them, such as those found in the lines of Elizabeth Frazer's article.",
                "However, I still want to call attention to the many marriages between high class Americans and Italians in America, which naturally indicates that Italian immigrants do become naturalized American citizens, and, that they assimilate the good America offers to them.",
                "In addition, there is not an Italian newspaper in the United States, that does not continually preach to Italian immigrants the Gospel of Americanization.",
                "At any rate, if the Italian quarters of any city lack cleanliness the fault lies particularly with the American health authorities who neglect such quarters and do not enforce, with the necessary vigor, the observance of the laws covering public hygiene.",
                "One should not entirely condemn the ignorant, the humble, the poor, and insist that they should spontaneously uplift themselves. Instead, the learned and the rich, who generally neglect the ignorant and the poor, should extend to them a helping hand in order to uplift them to a higher standard of living. This ought to be the mission of real civilization.",
                "This is the most sacred and most beautiful mission that America has to accomplish, since she believes herself, nowadays, to be the leading Nation of the world."

                "A few more years and the Italian colony of Chicago will be in the ascendency over the Italian colonies of New York, San Francisco, Boston, and Philadelphia.",
                "For the past ten years, the Italians of America have progressed in such a way that they cannot be accused of civic lethargy. The Italians have finally understood that in order to gain the confidence and the respect of the Americans, it is necessary to step out of small industries and dedicate themselves with energy to a broader commercial field, which is more productive and renumerative.",
                "The Jews have taken the lead in the financial, industrial, theatrical fields. Why are the Italians, who in number, intelligence, and will-power, are not inferior to the Jews, supposed to remain in obscurity, to be looked upon with suspicion, and satisfied with being called filthy and illiterate? There are many reasons in the past why the Italians kept themselves on a low social level. We need many volumes to state the origin, the consequence, and remedy of these causes.",
                "The following are some of the outstanding reasons: Negligence of the Italian Government in directing the Italian immigrants; the inefficiency and indifference of the consular authorities; criminality and dissension among the immigrants; one Italian, more shrewd and astute, defrauding another; and the lack of a spiritual assimilation.",
                "The war opened the way to a renaissance of the Italians. There was a spirit of unity when our colonists came in contact with the various governmental, press, economic, and diplomatic commissions. The consular authorities began to take an active part in the life of the Italian colony. The intellectual element, infused with new blood from across the sea, worked towards a new ideal and we saw the beginning of banking institutions like the \"Board of Italy\" of San Francisco, with Italian capital and directors, and useful industries, beautiful factories, and numerous commercial firms. The Italian colonies of America in a short period of time made themselves felt in the economic, political, and moral fields.",
                "The evolutionary process of the Italian colonies in America has been slow, but as we have already stated, there are many reasons for this retardation and we do not wish to say whose is the responsibility. We must rejoice that the Italians in America are in the ascendancy and we hope that the progress of our colonies will never stop but will continue forever.",
                "THE ITALIAN PRESS.",
                "This is not a study of the various stages of the progress of the Italian colonies of the United States. We only intend to give a resume of what is most outstanding in the progress of the Italian colony of Chicago. Just as architecture reveals the taste of a people, so the press reveals its sentiments. The Italian Press of America, once edited by incompetent pseudo-newspapermen, contributed much with their vulgar controversies to the spreading of discord, division, and ignorance among the Italian colonies. The press of today, remodeled and strengthened by educated and conscientious newspapermen, has taken steps to spread sound doctrines which will educate the masses.",
                "The patriotic and widely read review Il Corrocio under the supervision of Agostino di Biasa is an outstanding example. I1 Bolletino Della Sera and I1 Progresso Italo-Americano of New York; L'Italia of San Francisco; La Notizia and La Gazetta Del Massachusetts of Boston; and L'Opinione of Philadelphia are important newspapers rich in news value and editorials, with the double aim of keeping alive the sentiment of Italianism and of guiding towards a brighter future the Italian colonies in America.",
                "We point with pride to the high ideal set by the Italian Press of Chicago, which is equal, if not superior, to any in America. Leading Chicago Italian newspapers are: L'Italia, published since 1886, by Chev. Oscar Durante; La Tribuna Trans-Atlantica, whose policy is set by its owner and director, A. Mastro-Valerio; L'Idea, official organ of the Italian societies for the past ten years, and owned by A. Ferrari; Il Cittadino di Chicago which, though young in years has acquired for itself a good reputation with the public, and I1 Bolletino which is on the way to becoming an important monthly review under the direction of Mr. Pietro Nanni.",
                "The Italian Press has been one of the leading factors in the growth of the Italian colony of Chicago.",
                "BANKS AND INDUSTRIES.",
                "This intellectual renascence, like a blood transfusion, has resulted in a commercial and industrial enlargement and in the opening of new fields to our men of affairs. In the past, Italian trade was limited to a few imported Italian products which were sold entirely in the Italian colonies. Today the colony of Chicago has, as active factors, an agency of the Banco di Napoli; the Romano and Ariani Banks, substantial and honest institutions. It numbers many first class importing and exporting firms operating in their own buildings, among which are Bragno and Mustari Co., Daprato Statuary Co., Andrea Russo, Garibaldi and Cuneo, and the Garibaldi Co., each a leader in its particular field.",
                "Macaroni factories have been established in the past few years and their product has reached a standard which compares favorably with the best imported Italian macaroni. A. Morici and Co., Viviano Bros., Naples Macaroni Co., and Varco Bros. are equipped with modern machinery and furnished with all conveniencies.",
                "In an article of this size it is impossible to mention all the commercial and industrial activities, and the professions, such as law and medicine are so well represented that we cannot begin to name even their most prominent members. Of the Chicago Grand Opera Co., which this year gave the most outstanding and solemn confirmation of the superiority of Italian musical genius, we can only mention the name.",
                "THE SPIRIT OF INITIATIVE.",
                "A distinguishing trait of the Italian in the economic struggle is the spirit of initiative which has entered into the conscience of our men of affairs and which has been the herald of future economic and moral victories.",
                "The idea of limiting commercial activities within a restricted Italian sphere is not favored by the younger generation which is, even now, branching out into the American market, thus expanding and augumenting Italian capital and assisting the creative and constructive genius of the Italian in America.",
                "The following are among the leading industries of the colony: Melodia Phonograph Co., Wabash Shade Co., Marcheroni Furniture Co., and the Excelsior Dramatic Co.",
                "The Melodia Phonograph is under the able direction of Mr. E. Malato. He expects it to become as prominent as the Victor, Columbia, and Edison phonographs. An important discovery developed at the Melodia factory is an improvement in the mechanism which eliminates the scratching sound of the needle on the disc. A testimonial on the quality of this machine from Gino Marinizzi, one of the most competent personalities in matters of music, appears in another section of this bulletin. (Gino Marinizzi was director of the Chicago Grand Opera Co., after the death of Cleofonte Campanini.)",
                "The Melodia Phonograph has all the elements for success. It is ably directed by men whose honesty is unquestioned and the factory, at 400 N. Sangamon, boasts every modern technical and hygienic improvement.",
                "The Wabash Shade Co. is owned by George Silvestri, an up and coming member of our colony. This company's success is due to the resourcefulness and intelligence of Mr. Silvestri.",
                "The Mascheroni Furniture Co., established by G. Mascheroni, sculptor and woodcarver, makes high grade furniture which is sold by Tobey and Co. and Marshall Field and Co.",
                "The Excelsior Dramatic Co. is a sound theatrical company that is bound to spread a better knowledge of Italian drama in America and consequently raise Italian prestige, since the theater, like the press, is an important medium for propaganda.",
                "Italian is practically an unknown language to the Americans. The exaggerated admiration that this country shows for everything French is only equal to the diffidence shown for anything Italian. We are, more or less, responsible for this situation since we have but slightly taken advantage of the medium of publicity in asserting our Italianism. We have been blocked to a great extent by the Jugo-Slavs, Germans, and Austrians as well as by our \"beloved\" allies, the English and the French.",
                "In the Christmas week issue of the Bulletin of the New York Chamber of Commerce, Pasquale Di Biasi, the publisher, expressed the opinion that there is a need for an Italian theater on the order of the French theater which has been operating in New York for seven years, presenting French drama with French actors. We further suggest Italian drama translated into English and acted by American actors.",
                "The Excelsior Dramatic Co. has the unqualified support of the Italian public as well as that of Enrico Caruso, Italo Montemezzi, Gino Marinuzzi, Galli-Gurci, Judge Barasa, the attorneys Malato and Gualano, and many other prominent personalities. In March it hopes to present in one of Chicago's principal theaters, an Italian drama for which all critics prophesy an unequaled success.",
                "We are proud that the Italian colony of Chicago has kept in step with the colossal development of Chicago."

By doing so, he gives evidence of good faith: he openly throws in his lot with the fortunes of his adopted country and publicly declares his interest in the welfare of his community.

We hear a good deal nowadays of compulsory voting; why not compulsory naturalization? A man who has enjoyed the benefits and privileges of residence in this country for say, four years should not only enjoy the right to become a citizen but he should be forced to become a citizen or leave the country. This would be one of the just and effective ways of ridding the country of undesirables. It would be a fair test of the individuals desirability.",

R. 2667 now under discussion in the House does not represent the limited revision of the Tariff advocated by the President, but is rather intended to build a wall against all outside trade by providing on many articles rates of duties so high as to be altogether unnecessary for the legitimate protection of American labor and industry.",

The bill referred to, if enacted into law will make it extremely difficult to do so, and therefore will be detrimental to the interests and welfare of this country.",

We believe that when certain duties have been decided upon by Congress on a certain commodity they should remain as established for a reasonable period of time and not be subject to change from day to day.",

                "If it is the purpose of Congress to restrict immigration, we subscribe heartily to it; if it is the purpose of Congress to raise the standards of the would-be immigrants, we will say that we are in through accord and sympathy. In this there is no discrimination against any race. If Congress feels that the United States ought to have the best elements, clean in body and mind, that any country possesses, we will say that we are with you, whole-heartedly.",
                "The supreme interests of America are paramount with us but we earnestly submit that millions of Americans of Italian birth and extraction, should not be humiliated and degraded through the passage of the Johnson Bill.",
                "In restricting the quota of immigrants from Italy to a minimum and increasing that of the Nordic races to a maximum, the American nation will brand millions of its citizens as belonging to an inferior race. This we resent very strongly. There is nothing that Italy as a nation has done, and there is nothing that the Americans of Italian birth and extraction have done in this continent that would justify such unfair and brutally cruel treatment.",
                "It is being urged that the Italian immigrant is not absorbed into American life, that he is un-American and even anti-American in spirit, ideals, and aspirations - in short that he is un-assimilable.",
                "Who can testify best as to the assimilability of the immigrant? Is it not the man who is on the ground where the actual facts may be gleaned? Examine for instance, the situation in Chicago which has a considerable number of so-called \"unassimilated\" immigrants. The Johnson Bill virtually admits that the Nordic race is superior to the Italian. We ask in what respect?",
                "What are the greatest attributes of civilization? What country has contributed more than Italy to the arts, science, and literature?",
                "Only today is the greatest scientific invention of modern times the product of a fertile Italian brain. Witness Guglielmo Marconi, not only the discoverer of wireless telegraphy, but also the inventor of a system of broadcasting. Marvelous is this achievement surpassed by no other, by whose ingenuity and mental power it is permitted to fight the forces of evil, of vice, of disease, of ignorance, and of injustice.",

No man who has not some knowledge of the speech, customs, ways of life and habits of thoughts of this great country of ours could be capable of this great work. And who is the great builder, who is so truly representative of American customs and ideals? None other than Joshua Esposito, Chief Engineer of the Pennsylvania Railroad, one of those former immigrants whose alien elements have commingled with those wholesome teachings of liberty and freedom to form that sturdy virile nationality called America.",

His service in the legislature stands as a monument to the true ideals of Americanism. Never in his career as a law-maker did he fail to represent his district, state, and nation in a just and upright manner. That his success as a legislator was recognized, was demonstrated further by the great, inspiring loyal feats of Mr. Malato while acting as a public prosecutor under McClay Hoyne, for eight years State's Attorney of Cook County. And what greater proof of the sterling qualities of this former son of Italy would one desire when the present State's Attorney, Robert E. Crowe, recognized again his extraordinary capabilities and retained him in a special capacity? Well might we call him one of the foremost if not the greatest of criminal lawyers in this section of the country, both as prosecutor and defender as well.

Rosinia, whose work in the Domestic Relations Court and Morals Court have met with the unqualified indorsement of thousands upon thousands of the men and women whom he aided and reinvigorated by his zeal and ardor with a love of hearth and fireside. His efforts have never failed to elicit eulogistic treatment, not only from the press but from the members of the Illinois Bar, as well. All these examples show how jealous of honor, integrity, honesty, and Americanism have been these representatives of the so-called inferior race.",
                "Again may we point to a few examples of Chicago men in the commercial world; men who were mere immigrants some years ago, but who today occupy positions of trust and responsibility in large establishments. We refer to Joseph Malatesta, a typical son of an Italian immigrant, who occupies the very important position of vice-president of the Consumer Co., over whose destinies the well-known Fred Upham, treasurer of the National Republican Committee, presides.",
                "And then consider briefly the history and development of Joseph Soravia, manager of the music department of Sears, Roebuck Mail-Order House. He started his upward climb, a newcomer from Italy, arrived here at the age of eighteen, friendless and unacquainted, without even the rudiments of the English language. His first employment was that of order picker, at the munificent salary of $5.00 per week. Today that immigrant of 1901, stands an one of the main props of the largest mail order house in the world.",
                "Similar illustrations could be given showing conclusively that not only is the Italian assimilated and absorbed, but that when he starts even under a disadvantage, he shows qualities of leadership and executive ability, which are distinct assets to a government where law reigns supreme and where public sentiment stands as Lincoln said, \"With anybody that stands right.\"",
                "From reading the testimony given before the Congress Immigration Committee on the Johnson Bill, it is noticed that a statement was made that the Italian newspapers published in the United States are all for Italy and all against the United States. This is a palpable lie. The Italian newspapers of Chicago and it follows that they must be the same through the United States, are supported by American citizens of Italian birth more because the psychology of thought can be best understood in their parent language rather than through their adopted language; but although they naturally publish news of the reader's parent country which is not published in the English language newspapers they are, with but very few exceptions, thoroughly American in thought and principles.",
                "Congress must at least be consistent in its actions. By enacting the Johnson Bill into law it will hold that the Italian race is an inferior race, even though this country honored the district where Washington is located, the seat of our National Government, with the name of a man of that race. In April 1917, our country declared war against Germany, which was threatening seriously at that time to undermine the social, economical, and moral fabric of the world at large. In response to the call of our executive,armies were massed, all available raw material was collected, huge loans were successfully launched and the people of the nation gave - gave until it hurt, all - all for our supreme effort which was to be cast into the balance in the behalf of a civilization wrought out of blood and suffering and patterned after the idealism of a true christianity.",
                "We cannot give figures at this time as to the contributions of any citizens of foreign extraction, since none are available. There was no distinction created at that crucial period with regard to race, color, or previous condition of servitude. All were considered and acted as Americans and truly did the results attained bear out their purposeful resolves, as the slogan of the day put it, \"Make the World Safe for Democracy!\" A perusal of the army enlistment records will show a remarkable number of foreign names of the so-called inferior race.",
                "A glance at the fatality lists will show again a correspondingly large number of names of boys of the so-called inferior race. How times have changed! Lo! The Johnson Bill would show what a difference a few years make! The heroes of yesterday, their desires, their choice, their feelings, their opinions disregarded, and no attention paid to their appeal! Those who were assimilable in 1917, are not capable of being assimilated in 1924.",
                "Oh, Woe! Betide the times! But our country - \"May she be in the right\" but \"Our country, right or wrong.\"",
                "And even though there is a scattering of sentiment in the country which calls for race discrimination, yet the American citizen of Italian extraction will not rise up in righteous wrath and indignation and smite down the foe, but the better example, by kindlier deeds, \"With malice toward none and charity for all\" will portray to his fellow Americans the real and true characteristics of ideal American citizenship.",
                "If the nation's welfare requires restriction of immigration let it be upon a basis which deals fairly and impartially with the problem. Let us Americans resolve upon a solution of this question since the public good is vitally concerned in its settlement! Let us have before us that fundamental concept of fair play which is so strongly prevalent in American life. Let it not be said here or in any quarter of the world that Americans are biased and prejudiced against one another.",
                "Thus and in such manner have the citizens of Italian extraction throughout the Middlewest and particularly the State of Illinois registered their protest against unfair and un-American legislation.",

                "The members of the_____composed of American citizens, beg leave to offer a few suggestions which they hope will promote commerce and friendly relation between the United States and Italy, and the prosperity and welfare of both countries. We would remind you that our devotion to the welfare of the Republic as American citizens has been exemplified in the late war and in the subsequent period of reconstruction, both by the large number of our sons whom we sent to the colors, and the liberal contributions we have made to Liberty Bonds and the payment of other heavy obligations to support the country in its period of stress and upheaval.",
                "We feel, therefore, that we should be allowed, as for it lies within your power by legislation to retrieve our losses in part, and that our trade with Italy should be promoted and not hampered.",
                "The members of this Association are well aware of the conflicting interests involved and the difficulties of tariff revision in this critical time, when the country is passing through a period of readjustment after a war that has caused the greatest upheaval ever known in the economic history of the world.",
                "We are addressing you now in order that you use your good offices to avoid, or at least to mitigate, the great injustice and iniquity that would be perpetrated by the adoption of some of the proposed rates included in the tariff bill now in conference.",
                "We speak especially of the large increase proposed on articles of absolute necessity to the people whom we represent. They are already hard pressed by the continued high cost of living, with a decreasing wage and not always certain employment. The adoption of higher tariff rates will mean an additional higher cost, not only for the foreign articles, but for the domestic product as well. We state to you in all frankness that we consider some of the proposed rates an outrage against the consumer and a direct threat and menace to the laboring classes. The increased rates against which we are particularly desirous of calling your attention, and of protection against their exorbitant measure are the following:",
                "Lemons.....increased from one-half (1/2) cent to two cents per pound, notwithstanding they are an indispensable commodity even to the poorer class. Olive Oil.....increased from 30 cents per gallon to 7 1/2 cents per pound, equivalent to over 62 cents per gallon, if in containers weighing with the the immediate container less than 40 lbs. Olive Oil, not specially provided for, raised from 20 cents per gallon to 6 1/2 cents per pound, equivalent to over 50 cents per gallon, and this, notwithstanding its being an article of prime necessity for our population and not a luxury as it is considered in some quarters. Macaroni.....raised from 1 to 2 cents per pound; Cheese, increased from 20 per cent to 25 per cent ad valorem; Tomato Paste, increased from 25 per cent to 45 per cent ad valorem; Fish in Olive Oil - increased from 25 to 30 per cent ad valorem, and Inbrine - from 15 to 25 per cent ad valorem; Unshelled Almonds - increased from 3 to 5 cents per pound. Unshelled Walnuts - from 2 to 4 cents per pound. Unshelled Filberts - from 2 to 2 1/2 cents per pound. Shelled Filberts - from 4 to 5 cents per lb. Shelled Almonds - from 4 to 15 cents per pound. Shelled Walnuts - from 4 to 12 cents per pound. Dried Beans - from 25 cents per bushel of 60 pounds to 2 cent per pound. Mushrooms - from 2 1/2 cents per pound to 45 per cent ad valorem. Preserved Meats - from exemption of duty to 20 per cent ad valorem, and so forth.",

                "Sir:",
                "This Chamber, whose membership chiefly consists of American citizens residing in Chicago and other cities of the Middle West, interested in the import or export trade, or in both, most respectfully appeals to you to assist in defeating the so-called American valuation plan, as provided by Section 402 of the Fordney bill, now before the House.",
                "We regard that plan impossible of application, except with great injustice to the business men engaged in international commerce, and as detrimental to the people of this country in general, and we beg leave to state a few of the reasons why it should not be adopted.",
                "The value of a certain commodity is not the same in all the markets of this country, but may vary according to the local demand for it, the cost of freight, and other factors. The same article may be sold for a certain price in New York, and a higher, or a lower one, in Chicago or San Francisco.",
                "Great as the difficulty would be in establishing the value of an imported staple commodity, according to the price of which comparable and competitive products of the United States are sold in the principal market or markets of the United States, or were sold on the date of exportation of the imported merchandise, such difficulty would be increased many times in endeavoring to determine, according to the above standards, the value of seasonable goods, which constitute a large share of the importations from Italy.",
                "Indeed, regarding such merchandise, it would be actually impossible to institute a comparison with similar goods, the product of the United States, for the reason that often such goods are not produced here. Any attempt at establishing their value on the basis aforesaid would be a mere guess, and no good purpose could be served by considerably increasing the duties on them. We will, as an illustration, name artistic wares, made of marble or alabaster, as statuary not entitled to free admission as works of art, vases, pedestals, lighting bowls, lamps, and the like, which under paragraph 233 of the Fordney bill, would be subject to a duty of 40 per cent. Such goods are not commercially produced in this country, and we beg to inquire how their value could be established,even approximately, in the manner provided in the bill in question.",
                "If the value of the imported merchandise be determined by the price, at the option of the appraising officers and may include or exclude all costs, expenses, and so forth, including duties, profits, and commissions, should such merchandise be sold by the importer to a jobber who, in turn, would sell it in the usual wholesale quantities to the retailer, would its value be established according to the importer's selling price, or the jobber's?",
                "In either case, the importer, as well as the consumer, would be at the mercy of the appraising officers, who would have the power to pile duty upon duty and expenses upon expenses. It would be impossible for the importer to know, when he orders his goods, what their cost will be to him and he would be subject to severe penalties, or, at best, to long and costly litigation and no end of annoyance and loss of time.",
                "Comparison, furthermore, between articles of that nature would frequently be extremely difficult, and under the provisions of the Fordney bill, the appraising officers could, should they be so inclined, favor, or break an importer by excluding the duties, and so forth, in some cases, and including them in others.",
                "The uncertainty resulting from the adoption of the plan in question, as well as the great increase in the cost of all commodities, which would naturally follow the suppression of healthy competition by practically making the importation of many kinds of goods an impossibility, would cause the present depression in business to continue indefinitely. This depression, being largely due to the fact that the public refuses to buy in expectancy of a fall in the prices of merchandise, the question may be asked, how much will it buy when the prices soar?",
                "By taxing imported merchandise out of existence, as would be done under the valuation feature of the Fordney bill, and practically laying an embargo against importations, we would take away from the European nations one of their principal means of fulfilling their obligations to us. We would also effectively hinder their currency from returning to normalcy, thus making it impossible for them to buy our goods, and preventing the extension and development of our export trade.",
                "Aside from a decent respect for the rights and interest of others, which in this enlightened age should prevail among nations, as well as among individuals, self-preservation demands that no laws which would be harmful to ourselves, such as the valuation plan of the Fordney bill would unfailingly be, shall be passed by Congress.",
                "To quote the president's words as recently reported, \"We may not hope to sell where we refuse to buy.\"",
                "We beg to submit our opinion that should it be regarded as necessary by a majority of Congress to raise the duties on certain commodities, it would be far preferable seasonably to increase the rate of duties on such goods according to the old and tried standard of valuation, rather than pass legislation, which would unfairly, unnecessarily, and enormously increase all duties, and inevitably result in chaos.",

                "The Conference Committees,",
                "Prohibition Amendment Agriculture Bill.",
                "At a specially called meeting by the Italian Chamber of Commerce of Chicago, (an organization representing in a very wide sense of feelings and sentiments of all the wine-using population of the Middle West), held in Chicago, Illinois, on October 5, 1918, there was adopted without a dissenting vote, the following statement, touching a matter held vital to the health, contentment, and well being, not only of our population of Italian birth or descent, but likewise of those many other various populations who themselves, or whose immediate ancestors, came to the United States from countries where light wine is the universal national beverage.",
                "Whereas, An Amendment to the Agriculture Bill is about to be acted upon by your Honorable Committee, which will include in its provisions a prohibition of the manfacture of wine, and",
                "Whereas, protests are arriving on all sides from our wine-using population; and from growers of grapes, who foresee in the prohibition of wine manufacture the serious deterioration, if not practical destruction of America's great grape industry; we therefore respectfully beg the privilege, because of the seriousness of the situation, of bringing to your attention, briefly, the following declaration, and silent facts:",
                "First, we recognize that if possible all strictly alcoholic liquors should as beverages, be banished from America; not for the period of war, only, but for all time.",
                "Second, we recognize that under the stress of this World War an opportunity has come to carry through, and if proper wisdom is exercised, perhaps make binding indefinitely, this great consummation.",
                "Third, for the permanent welfare of America it is not enough that intoxicating liquors be barred during the war, they should be eradicated for all time and we hold this can best and most easily be done by substitution of light wines. The alcoholic liquors are to be permanently done away with, and this war time measure is primarily an effort in that direction. In the very nature of the case a substitute will be demanded and must be provided. What more healthful or harmless could be provided than wines restricted by law to a non-intoxicating alcoholic content, similar to the light wines, the peoples everyday wines.....of France and Italy?",
                "Fourth, it is exceedingly childish that because alcoholic liquors are the curse of the world, that non-intoxicating wines should be placed in the same category and denied our people, upon the false assumption that wine works either harm to the physique, or undermines the morale of the individual. Both assumptions are false. Without going further to show that wine is not inimical to morals we have the authority of our Savior; and that it is beneficial to health, we have the authority of the greatest of the Apostles.",
                "Fifth, this whole prohibition amendment is based wholly upon the necessity of conserving grain during the war. Since, then, this whole amendment is based upon the conservation of grain, why, we respectfully ask, should wine be included, when in its manufacture not one iota of grain is used? It may be claimed that if wine is omitted from the Prohibition Bill, that it opens the door for beer and whisky manufacturers to say that preference is being shown and demand like exemption or treatment for themselves, but before this door is opened it must be shown that beer and whisky use no more grain.",
                "Sixth, we respectfully call the attention of your Honorable Committee to the fact that grapes rank third (possibly second), in the great fruit crops of America, and that if the manufacture of wines should be prohibited, even for a single year, America's great grape industry would be seriously imperilled, if not in large measure ruined.",
                "Seventh, conservation of grain means conservation of food; prohibition of wine manufacture means destruction of food, this proves that there are thousands of tons of grapes, yearly, that for many reasons, such as violent wind storms, rains, hall storms, over-ripening, and so forth, can neither be shipped to market nor made into raisins at home. Bar these grapes from being made into wine and one of the principle props upon which the grape grower leans is knocked from under him. A bad season has faced the grower, but his ability to save his crop in the shape of wine, saves him from downright ruin. Turning his crop into wine is the more easily accomplished from the fact that the grower, who is in straitened circumstances, is not burdened with the hardship of buying sugar for making his wine, as the wine we advocate does not require a particle of sugar in its manufacture. It is simply the pure unadulterated juice of the grape fermented to a point where it holds a non-intoxicating percentage of alcohol, and fermentation is absent.",
                "Eighth, it may be questioned by the over zealous prohibition advocates why not make all these thousands of tons of otherwise wasted grapes into grape juice instead of wine? The answer is plain and simple, that a modicum of grapes are at the present time made into grape juice, and only a modicum, the reason being that grape juice is to very many neither agreeable to the palate nor stomach, while wine on the contrary, is practically universally agreeable to both.",
                "Ninth, truly ninety-eight per cent of Italians drink wine from childhood to old age, and yet, their longevity is proverbial and sobriety one of their cardinal virtues.",
                "Tenth, there are three greatly used beverages; coffee, tea and wine, all equally harmless, all with a certain percentage of food value, but wine, it may truthfully be said, has the greatest food value of any. Then why, since all are equally harmless, should the one of highest food value be chosed as the one to be denied our people? Is such an act grounded on sober wisdom or is it because a great wave of hysteria has carried the American people off their feet?",
                "Eleventh, the moment the war ends a great movement will be set on foot by the liquor interests for the restoration of alcoholic liquors, and joining this movement will be the whisky, brandy, gin and beer manufactures and drinkers, and should wine be prohibited during the war, then to these interests will be added the grape growers and wine manufacturers and drinkers.",
                "These will be reinforced by millions of our returning soldiers, who will return to our shores as confirmed wine drinkers as are their comrades of France and Italy. Should these returning soldiers return to a wineless America, they will at once clamor for their accustomed wine and be ready to join any movement, however, rash, that would restore to them their glass of wine at dinner; without which that meal would be as flat and tasteless as would be their breakfast without its cup of coffee. Let us be firm in this matter. Who is there would back a law which would deprive him of his morning coffee or his evening tea, knowing both to be harmless? Why then seek to deprive another of his mid-day or evening wine, he knowing fully well that his beverage is equally harmless?",
                "Twelfth, returning to the post-war agitation for alcoholic liquors; if wine is permitted during the war, hundred of thousands of whisky drinkers will have become during this war period, too accustomed to wine, to return to alcoholic drinks. They, instead of joining the forces of the advocates of strong liquors will join the forces of the opponents, and they will be joined by the grape growers and present wine drinkers, and will be reinforced by the thousands of our returned veterans, who prize their wine; and these three great forces added to by the great army of moderates when taken altogether, will constitute such a tremendous force that alcoholic liquors will never again throw their baleful shadow over the happiness of our people.",
                "Thirteenth, in submitting this somewhat lengthy statement, we do so with the respectful prayer that you will give it the consideration which the great issue at stake justifies. Should your wisdom decide that permission to manufacture wine during the war should not be denied and conclude that such action would result in the prevention after the war of a return in the manufacture of alcoholic liquors, we feel satisfied, since moderation in all things, especially legislation, is the soul of wisdom, that your your decision would be justified before the bar of the American people and the world. With sentiments of the highest regard, we subscribe ourselves,",

                "The Grand Venerable, Chevalier George J. Spatuzza, having performed well and thoroughly the fundamental duty of assuring to the Order its financial stability, conceived the idea of the banquet and submitted it to the approval of the Grand Council at its meeting last February 24.",

                "In prospecting his idea the Grand Venerable added: \"It is my earnest desire that the day to be fixed for the banquet should coincide with the epoch making one of the discovery of America: With that memorable day, which for us Italians is an inexhaustable source of pride, and for the rest of the valuable benefits that have been reaped from the inspired act of this, our great Italian genius. It will be our privilege and our cherished wish to affirm on that occasion, in the most solemn and befitting manner, that the solidarity of our race, cemented by adversities and triumphs, remains still unchanged as it has been unchangable throughout the centuries. And we wish to assert it on that day when, in the simplicity of his soul, the immigrant, recalling the memory of the greatest explorer of all times, through him perceives the numberless glories that are ours, and that no hostile and base propaganda can efface or contaminate.",
                "And while the immigrant rejoices, hopes and prays that his Italy may always achieve everlasting glory, we, who have espaused his cause, will initiate with a symbolic send-off, his son or daughter into the social and political life of the country.",
                "We also mean by this noble gesture inspired by a disinterested principle of brotherhood, to confer deserved value on that conspicuous contribution of Latin intelligence and initiative, that the offspring of the immigrant is ready to offer to this land so dear to us, because it is the land of Columbus, Vespucci, Verrazzano, Toriti, Vigo, Meucci, and many others, who are too numerous to be mentioned.",
                "The suggestion was unanimously approved by the Grand Council which resolved to accept also, in that connection, another important suggestion made by the Grand Venerable which completes and enhances the previous one. It was resolved that on that occasion funds be raised for the endowment of one or more scholarships to be assigned to those students of Italian birth or extraction, who during the year have obtained the best average in their study at any high school of the state.",
                "Of its own initiative and with the purpose of encouraging the study of the Italian language in our schools, the Grand Council also approved the conferring of prizes, (the nature of which is to be determined), to those boys or girls irrespective of their nationality, who have, during the year, obtained the best average in the study of Italian."

We feel also, that our motto, \"God and Country,\" has spurred us to carry on, in a sincerely Christian and genuinely patriotic spirit, the good work of true brotherhood; that during these years our generous helpfulness has been accorded to our less fortunate brothers, and all needy people both here and abroad, and that our assistance and comfort has greatly helped, morally and materially, to ease the sorrow and want of widows and orphans of those who have departed from us.",

Figures and statistical tabulations are unromantic and are only interesting to a technical mind.",

Every organization, from the family to the nation, must have a sufficient flow of young blood to assure its continuity, therefore, since the usual replenishment of a society like ours is no longer possible, because of the restrictive immigration measures, we must enroll the children of our members and their offspring.",

Such a charge or insinuation questions the loyalty of its members toward this great, glorious union, the United States of America. We strongly resent such, for in time of war, as well as in time of peace, we have shown our fidelity to the land of our adoption and that, as far as we are concerned, we owe allegiance to no country but the United States of America. If to nourish a spiritual attachment to the traditions of one's land of origin or extraction be construed as fostering a part of dual allegiance, then we plead guilty to the charge and in defense, thereto, we state that a person should be proud of the land of his nativity or the land of the nativity of his father and mother. He or she who is not, is not worthy of becoming a citizen of this great country.",
                "In the name of justice and decency is there any one who could truthfully say that the Order Sons of Italy in America, as an organization, has done a single thing to stir up war sentiment or that it has promoted the Facist attack on Ethiopia?",
                "Or has there been a single act committed to show that it took over the functions of the old Fascist League of North America, or that it is a Fascist organization? My brother members know that the only answer to such an inquiry is a negative one and the world at large should know the same thing.

                "The conduct of the Chicago Daily Tribune does not and will not, however, discourage us in our mission to unite under the banner of the Order Sons of Italy in America, all those of Italian birth or extraction residing in this country, but on the contrary it furnishes us with more proof, that a union such as ours is necessary for under it we may combat all the abuses hurled at our people, thereby affirming just rights and privileges for us and our generations to follow."

This is not to be understood that its members as individuals should not take part in the political life of their communities and of the nation. Both our by-laws and ritual are very explicit in this regard. On the contrary one of the purposes of our Order is (I am quoting from the ritual): \"To spread among the brothers the conviction that active participation in the political life of this nation is a factor of social betterment. For this purpose the Order shall encourage, prepare and assist the brothers to acquire the certificate of naturalization and with it the right to vote.\"",
                "In other words, while politics have no place in the Order, each member has the moral obligation to belong to one of the political parties of this nation, and through his activities in the party to work for the realization of the ideal of the Order - \"the recognition of our racial element.\" And in this endeavor we who come from across the sea, cannot very well succeed without cooperation and support of the young generation of Italian-Americans now coming of age.",
                "They are our boys and girls, who have to bear the brunt of this struggle. We of the older generation had to contend with economic conditions upon our arrival on these shores. In the battle for the essentials of life we could not afford either time nor money for political struggle. It is the duty of our boys and girls to prove to the other racial elements that our race is second to none in intelligence and ability in the administration of public affairs.",
                "In the last two decades members of our race have asserted themselves and won prominent places in the industries of the nation. In commerce they stand with the best: in banking, printing, manufacturing, etc. In every kind of human activity they have acquired positions of responsibility and importance. Everybody knows and admits the contributions to the arts by our painters, sculptors, musicians, singers, and writers. We will not even mention the victories of our athletes; victories which were certainly a surprise to those who considered us an inferior race. But in politics we are forced to admit that we have not done so well. Our position in this field is the lowest of all and out of proportion with the number of our votes, and the results are entirely different from those obtained in other fields and not in accordance with the tradition of our race.",
                "We have only a few congressmen in Washington and no senator or governor of a state belongs to our racial group. Very small is the number of our senators and representatives in the state assemblies. In only three cities of any importance is the mayor of Italian descent. Here in this State of Illinois, where we are about one-tenth of the total population, no position of responsibility is filled at the state capitol by any one of our race; neither have we representation of any kind on the numerous boards and commissions of the state government.",
                "What are the reasons, may be asked, for such a condition of affairs? The answers are easy. First of all - the lack of unity among the different groups, and the lack of confidence in men who could assume leadership in a competent manner. This has caused misunderstanding among ourselves to the benefit of politicians of other nationalities, who after being elected to office by our votes, went to Washington to vote us out as \"undesirables.\"",
                "What are the remedies for this condition which is so humiliating and marks us as inferiors in comparison with those racial elements, who for number, culture, and tradition cannot in any way compare with us? First of all it is absolutely necessary that there should be unity in all the different groups, harmony among the leaders, a strong organization and, most important of all, that our boys and girls should take an active part in the political life of our communities. After all they are the ones that are going to be benefitted most in this struggle. It is for their sake that we, older men, are standing on the firing line today, so as to prepare the ground for them to achieve a victory tomorrow.",
                "They should be convinced that the fact that they are of Italian descent should not be a deterrent from entering public life, but an incentive. Fiorello La Guardia, Mayor of New York City, has shown the way. His indomitable courage has made him the chief magistrate of the most important city of the world. With him as an outstanding example, our boys and girls need not fear failure. He has shown that even racial or religious antagonism can be conquered."

                "A committee chosen from the Italian colony of Chicago recently organized a patriotic festival in the vast Bowen Hall of Hull House to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the battles of Solferino and San Martino. The festival was given for the benefit of Columbus Hospital and the Italian Womens' Welfare Society. The promoting committee was composed of persons who were liked and esteemed by the colony, and the hall could not have been more suitable in size and locality. No expense was spared in making the announcements; the program was most attractive; and the admission fee of twenty-five cents was ridiculously small. And yet, out of 70,000 Italians living in Chicago barely a hundred came to the celebration. Why?",
                "Let us first make an unbiased statement of facts. The music was good; the artists of both sexes, introduced by their Maestra, Mrs. Boetti, demonstrated their excellent training; the lecturer, Mr. Luigi Ferraro, is an orator of rare elegance; and Mrs. Elviva Remondini is a marvelous reciter. But the public was absent. Why?",
                "The first thing that one noticed upon arriving was the number of empty seats, and the second thing was the decoration of the stage. Three enormous American flags covered two thirds of the background while on one side there was a single, small Italian flag hidden by the Stars and Strips. We feel sure that Mr. Mastrovalerio, our charming fellow-journalist, though of the opposition who planned the festival, did not purposely arrange such a display of flags. Instead, we are convinced that he rummaged all through the colony in order to find an Italian flag of size and appearance adequate for the occasion. But he did not find it, and he could not find it, and that single little tri-colored flag, smothered by the three big American flags on a stage where the Italian fatherland was being glorified, was elected to be the index of Italian patriotism in America, - vanquished and scattered by the utilitarianism of the colony.",
                "The Italian royal march and the national anthem did not arouse much enthusiasm in the audience, for they are both expressions of one fatherland, one's own. Garibaldi's hymn was warmly and unanimously cheered, for that is the hymn of the soldier of all countries, of the hero who offers his sword to all who are oppressed. When the band played the Marseillaise, it was applauded with great fervor, even by the ladies in the audience; it is the hymn of revolution. Nearly all the members of the committee which promoted this festival were naturalized American citizens. If you should ask them how they were under solemn oath to renounce all duties and rights as Italians and to adopt another fatherland, they would all reply that it was a matter of self-interest.",
                "Very well. But if self-interest justifies the abnegation of one's patrioticties, why should it not also justify the internationalism of socialist working-men?",
                "It was well to extol the beauty of our mother tongue on that evening. But why is it, then, that the children of ninety-nine percent of the Italians in America do not know how to speak correctly one word of Italian? Why, then, do these same Italo-Americans feel a sacred solidarity with the 100,000 Italians of Trieste who refuse to speak German while they remain indifferent toward their children's ignorance of Italian? Moreover, there are two millions and a half of us over here, and comparatively few Italians live in Austria.",
                "We Socialists feel and proclaim our internationalism. You fellow-countrymen of ours, on the other hand, cherish the delusion that you are not internationalists while all your actions point to the contrary. You plan a patriotic manifestation, and it demonstrates merely that Italian patriotism is lacking in America, - which is a good thing. This is evident when we see that even prominent Italo-Americans try to conceal their origin, that most of them display the clean-shaven upper lip of Americans, and that their offspring remain absolutely ignorant of their mother tongue."

                "The Aurora of Philadelphia, in its issue of June 25th, had the following to say about our very dear director the Rev. P. R. De Carlo. We cite the main points of the article:",
                "We are pleased to make known to our readers that ten Italian ministers are attending this year's Northern Baptist Convention. They are, Basile, Buffa, Cordo, Di Domenica, Franconi, Mangauo, Panizzoli, Saltarelli, Silvestri, Solimene, The Rev. Pasquale R. De Carlo, Presbyterian pastor of that city (Chicago) and Field Secretary for the Presbyterian Church Extension Society, honored the ten Italian ministers with a dinner at an Italian restaurant.",
                "During the course of the dinner, the writer of this article gave a short speech in which he sketched briefly the missionary career of our brother De Carlo, whom he has known for thirty years, praising his gifts as missionary, pastor, field secretary and organizer on a large scale in the ecclesiastic field, as well as in the field of Italian-American journalism.",
                "In the latter field, years back, he published a weekly, Il Cittadino, which at that time was considered one of the best Italian-American publications in circulation. Because of his ministerial duties, he was forced to discontinue it, and when it passed into the hands of others it soon went out of existence. At the present time the Rev. De Carlo is publishing a monthly review called The Vita Nuova, well set-up and well edited with a very artistic cover. He has the collaboration of eminent Italian and American writers. The Rev. Dr. Mangano also talked and praised his kind host.",
                "The Rev. De Carlo with unequaled modesty thanked the brothers, Di Domenica and Mangano, for their beautiful testimony, and assured them that he is kept informed of the work done among Italians by other denominations, following with interest their conquests for Christianity. He related the story of an Italian who came to attend the Eucharistic Congress of Chicago, the past year, and had been converted to the Gospel after reading the Bible.",
                "After a vote of thanks given to De Carlo, the ten Italian ministers went back to the Coliseum where the convention was being held. They were much satisfied at having attended because they had learned much to pass on to their congregations. The following year this convention is being held in Detroit, Mich., one week before the Baptist World Convention which is being held in Toronto, Canada."

This church represents a value of at least $40,000, over $7,000 of which came out of the Loyalty fund and $30,000, of which Mr. De Carlo raised by his own personal solicitations. The major portion that Mr. De Carlo solicited came from one devoted friend of the Board's work.

                "But since I read the March-April issue of your Vita Nuova, in which appears your article \"The Eternal Question,\" I have come to know you very well and I congratulate you since that which you write is worthy of you, Pasquale De Carlo, and I feel it is my duty to write to you the following:",
                "You say to us, sincere Protestants, that we do not believe that in Italy there exists freedom of religious discussion. You fanatical zealots! We, who know that the contrary exists, that Italy does not have religious freedom, call you, and those who think like you, Parasites.",
                "Let us agree for your sake, that the concordat between Papacy and Fascism gave to the Papacy only a small state insignificant as to size, but, that which the Church of Rome in the 1116 years of its temporal power, could not obtain by excommunication or force of arms from princes, jealous of the political independence of their states, has been obtained from a ruffian who holds an entire nation in slavery and derives his power from infamous acts to execrable betrayal.",
                "This lying and ignorant despot who, by right, belongs in an insane asylum, raises his squat and obscene figure, against civilization, freedom and the progress of the century to place on the head of the gagged and conquered Italian people the leaden hood of the theological code of the Council of Trent in 1545.",
                "You say that faith must be sincerely felt, bravo Mr. De Carlo, tell me frankly, have you ever had sincere faith? Tell me, why has \"hero\" Mussolini, whom you laud, accepted and imposed on the Italian people in the twentieth century, that canonical law, so conceived and decreed that even the Spanish Inquisition refused to ever recognize it? He surely did not do it to give the Protestants the freedom of spreading the Gospel and create that faith in the hearts of men.",
                "For us, sincere Evangelists (you are excepted) the fall of the temporal power signified the crowning event of the \"Risorgimento\" and the fight for national unity. It signified the beginning of an era the sum and principles of which were liberty, equality and justice.",
                "No, instead, through the efforts of this miserable and many times criminal Mussolini, the Pope is, not only sovereign of an \"insignificant\" State, as you say, but also the spiritual father of the Italians through the observance of that canonical law, Again, Mr. De Carlo, do you consider the obligatory teaching of the false Catholic religion in the schools, freedom of worship in Italy - the fatherland of Bruno, Cavour, Garibaldi, Mazzini, Mameli, Cairolo, Savonarola?",
                "Come, come, Mr. De Carlo, tell me honestly, how much do you receive each month from the Fascist party for printing such lies and for calling sincere followers of Christ like us, fanatics, I ask you, \"Can a mule give birth to Lambs?\"",
                "You refer us to the writings of the \"Valdese Romano.\" What can it or any other paper published in Italy, say? Does a press exist in Italy? No! and if it does not exist, how can an Evangelical review express itself freely? Have you seen a single word contrary to the Concordat in the newspapers coming from Italy even in an Evangelical review?",
                "No, they cannot do it, and if they did, a prison or an island concentration camp would be their lot. Therefore, whatever we receive and read from Italy is only that which is allowed to be printed and not the truth. Remember, in Italy tyranny rules and the things which they write are the things which tyranny permits.",

                "On Sunday, March 22, in an Evangelical Church of this city, a brother member, recently returned from Italy, where he had gone in the autumn of last year, gave a talk. This man, because of the vile and prostitute Italian press of North America was a Fascist. While in Italy he visited Rome and many other cities.",
                "Wherever he found himself he visited the Church, of which he was a member of thirty year's standing. He asked no one's opinion as to the position of the Evangelical Church nor to what extent it was allowed to proselyte. He said the faith is in the hearts of our brothers. He made the statement that to our religion, proselyting is not permitted. I cannot repeat his talk word for word, all I can say is, that though he was a Fascist when he went over, he returned an Anti-Fascist, According to him, the Protestant Religion in Italy, thanks to the government which you so highly praise, finds itself in the position of a smuggler who attempts to enter his country between two rows of Internal Revenue men. And you say that there is freedom? For shame, \"Iscariot!\"",

The newspaper concludes the article by saying: that these distributors of sweets run the risk of a beating at the hands of these husky peasants after they have accepted and eaten the sweets.",
                "The provocation of the courteous Bolognese newspaper against the propagandists of the Methodist Church is on a par with the \"most noble\" doctrine of the reformers of Italy who it seems are inspired by the maxim: \"abuse and thrash.\"",
                "Do you see, De Carlo, how free is the discussion of our religion which, in order to propagate it, places our brothers (you are excepted, because I repeat, you are a parasite) under much risk?",
                "Mr. De Carlo, it is a great shame to know that you are an Evangelist but so was Judas an Apostle of our Lord, Jesus Christ. He betrayed the Lord for thirty pieces of silver. You are an Evangelist who is paid for being that, but it would not surprise me to know that you would betray thirty Christs for one piece of silver.",

Exception, of Course, must be made to the Roman Catholic religion, to which as a religion, Masons have no objection but which itself opposes Masonry as godless and subversive of all good."

                "If we compare Christianity as it appears in the Gospel with the Roman Catholic Church of the last seventeen hundred years, it does not take a genius to discover that the name of Christian has survived, but its meaning has vanished.",
                "One wonders just what is meant by the reawakening of Roman Catholicism. It may mean any one of a hundred things. For instance, it may mean the Eucharistic Congress held in Chicago two years ago, followed by a crime wave which finds no parallel in the annals of any nation nor in the criminal records of any city of ancient or modern times. It may mean the ably planned, careful, and relentlessly pursued policy which would exclude the Holy Bible from our public schools. It may mean the candidacy for the office of President of the militant governor of New York. It may mean the assassination of President Obregon of Mexico at the hand of a faithful instrument of the Jesuits. It may mean the proposed return of the High Anglican Communion to the fold, and it may mean the breaking away of seventy-six per cent of the people of Czecho-Slovakia from the papal dogma a kind of Unitarian doctrine. It may mean the kissing of the toe of the Pope by the handsome Mayor of New York, and it may mean the burning of hundreds of copies of the Holy Bible placed by that gallant Gideon's Band in the hotels of America and removed by the Knights of Columbus, who delivered them to the Bishop of Boston to be sprinkled with holy water and subsequently destroyed by fire. It may mean the last papal encyclical De Vera Religionis Unitatis Fovenda, which appeared on the sixth day of last January, and in which we read that \"Christ our Lord instituted His (the Roman-Catholic) Church as a perfect society,\" and that \"the Apostolic See cannot on any terms take part in any assembly having for its object meeting on equal terms with other churches.\"",
                "It may mean the ever-increasing interest of the Roman-Catholic Church in the parochial school system, and it may mean the resolution passed unanimously by the Knights of Columbus at their annual convention in Philadelphia demanding that the President of the United States withdraw diplomatic recognition of the Government of Mexico. Yes, the reawakening of Roman Catholicism may mean any one of these things and many others that could be added to the list.",
                "But let us observe for a moment one or two of these various manifestations of the possible reawakening of the Church of Rome. Take the last one on our list. What seems to be the trouble with the Roman Catholic Church beyond the Rio Grande River? Are the Mexican people mad? Is the so-called persecution of priests, monks, and nuns due to their religious fervor? Was the conflict between the Roman Catholic clergy and the government born of the clergy's passion for saving the people from their sins? The answer is that the present conflict is only for political control. The cause of all trouble, we are told, is the adoption of the new Mexican constitution. Up to this time the Catholic Church had demanded that the constitution of Mexico should provide that \"the religion of the Mexican nation is and shall perpetually be Roman Catholic Apostolic. The nation will protect it by wise and just laws and prohibit the exercise of any religion whatsoever.\" Now this devilish article has been replaced by one more modern and more spiritual. It reads as follows: \"Every one is free to embrace the religion of his choice and to practice all ceremonies, devotions, or observances of his own creed, either in places of public worship or at home, provided that these do not constitute an offense punishable by la bang, bang, bang!\" The Pope refuses to submit to the enforcement of a national constitution and issues his mandate to a nation, calling upon his spiritual subjects to disobey the laws of their country. And he has done this in the most sweeping terms. The document concludes with these words:",
                "\"Thus we make known to the faith in Mexico and the Catholic Universe that we energetically condemn every decree that the Mexican government has enacted against the Catholic religion, against the Church and her sacred ministers and pastors, against her laws, rights, and property, and also against the authority of this Holy See. We raise our pontifical voice with apostolic freedom before you to condemn, reprove, and declare null, void, and of no effect the said decree and all others which have been enacted by the civil authorities in such contempt of the ecclesiastical authority of this Holy See, and with such injury to religion, to its sacred ministers, and to illustrious men.\"",
                "This is an expression, to be sure, of the reawakening of Roman Catholicism, and it cannot be over-emphasized that the Vatican is not half so much interested in the coming of the Kingdom of our Lord as it is in claiming the right to a voice in the temporal affairs of nations.",
                "In former days the Pope compelled the German Emperor to stand for three days in the snow of Canossa, but today because his influence is waning with the progress of civilization, and because the government of Mexico turned a deaf ear to the Pope and actually punished those priests and nuns who deliberately refused to obey the laws of the land, the Church of Rome ordered the assassination of President-elect Obregon just as in former days it ordered the assassination of that brave soldier of the Cross, William of Orange. That is one expression of the reawakening of Roman Catholicism.",
                "Let us focus our attention on just one other possible expression of such a revival. Let us take for our observation the tremendous parochial school building program. It is because the Roman Catholic Church is so enthusiastic about education? Is it not true that wherever the Roman Catholic Church has had full sway, illiteracy and superstition and poverty abound? Who dares to deny that the largest groups of illiterates are to be found in Russia, in Spain, in Latin America, in Austria, and, until recent years, in Italy?",
                "Could it be that the Roman Catholic Church, which up to yesterday had condemned education in all its forms, is now making an honest effort to follow in the footsteps of the Protestant Reformation by ushering in a new era of learning?",
                "There has been a series of articles on the Roman Catholic Church in the Atlantic Monthly from the pen of an American Roman Catholic clergyman of more than national prominence, as the Atlantic itself informs us, adding: \"For over thirty years he has ministered to his large flock with gentle devotion and untiring zeal. Renowned for his intellectual attainments, he has held high and responsible positions in his church.\"",
                "This clergyman, in his article entitled \"The Heresy of the Parochial School,\" writes:",
                "\"The truth is, the activities of the Catholic Church in America have been diverted from their proper aim. Education has supplanted religion in its own sphere. The Church has become so institutionalized that it has been commercialized. It is already top-heavy. The financial burden is becoming almost unbearable to many. To support the ever increasing number of institutions, the martyr spirit is developed in the people. Poor souls, who must pay the public school tax and at the same time meet the private school assessment! It is unjust, they are told, yet they must bear it manfully. The excellence of their Catholic school is continually dinned into their ears. Nevertheless many are growing skeptical. They are beginning to apply Christ's test, \"By their fruits ye shall know them.\" They are beginning to ask wherein these children, who are nursed in the lap of Mother Church, excel. None can maintain that they are more pious, more religious, than the children of generations which attended the public schools ..... There are just as many criminals .... We are already reaping the whirlwind sown in our schools. Many thoughtful priests are disturbed by the failure of the system, but they are the victims of circumstance. They may not, unscathed, voice their fears and doubts. They see the new generation drifting away from the practice of religion.\"",
                "Why, it sounds almost like a Protestant of the K. K. K. school summing up the situation, and yet he is a Roman Catholic clergyman of more than national prominence!",
                "Listen to him some more: \"The priest submits humbly, abjectly, if he would maintain his standing. But many there are who rebel at heart. The world would be astounded did it know the number of priests with the desire to remain faithful to the forms of ecclesiasticism while their very being cries out against the system. These are not the frivolous, not the careless, not the negligent or the unworthy, they are those who have broken through the fanatical wall that was built about them during the years of their seminary training. They are men who have burned the midnight oil and through travail have come to know the glorious privilege of independent thought.",
                "Such clergymen see clearly that religion in the Catholic Church today has become a complex and intricate mass of laws, dogmas and practices that little resemble the simple faith of the early centuries.",
                "Now, ladies and gentlemen, tell me, can anything like that interfere with our work? Of course the largest number of our American friends have trouble in understanding even the simple language of this Roman Catholic writer. But I have no trouble at all. I still remember one little story which I read when I was being intellectually nursed by a saintly Roman Catholic priest. The story is from a little book entitled, \"The Little Flower of St. Francis.\" Here is the story:",
                "\"Once St. Francis received twelve boys who wished to become friars, and to test them he called them to the garden and gave them a set of little plants to be transplanted, and he told them: 'Look at me and do just the same thing that I am doing.'",
                "\"And he began to make holes in the ground and to put in the plants in this queer way, with the branches buried in the holes and the roots sticking up out of the ground. The boy who was next to him was shocked at this way of planting, but remembering his instructions, he made a hole in the ground and put the branches of the plant in and left the roots out. The next boy did the same, and the next, until one of them said: 'Father Francis, I am the son of a farmer and know how to plant these plants, and the way to plant them successfully is to put the root into the ground and leave the branches out.'",
                "\"'Oh my boy,' said St. Francis, 'go thy way. Leave the monastery at once and return to the farm of your father. You may be a good farmer, but you would never be a good friar.'\"",
                "It is possible in this day and generation that anything like that will interfere with our work? Shall I continue now to describe one by one the various manifestations of the reawakening of Roman Catholicism, such as the burning of the Holy Bible, the candidacy of Mr. Smith for the presidency, the Eucharistic Congress with its results? Only he who does not wish to see it could fail to see that all these manifestations of reawakening cannot interfere with our work for the simple reason that our work is in the field of religion, while theirs is in the field of politics.",
                "So let us not waste any time in argument about anything's interfering with our work and especially about the reawakening of Roman Catholicism's interfering with it, but let us consecrate ourselves anew to the task of saving souls. We know that we can release that fresh life which comes only from a renewed vision of God and a clearer understanding of our Christ. One who along the lines that Christ laid down has in his own life overcome doubt and mastered the inward strugle, becomes by his mere presence a source of creative power to those among whom he lives. Why do we know so much more about the life of Francis of Assisi than about the life of Goldoni? The answer is that while Goldoni made many plays all of which we have, Francis of Assisi made only one play. The play of his life, presented with all the temperament of an artist, was the pattern and example of Christ.",
                "Let us not forget that a Bunyan writing in an unspeakable English prison, a George Washington kneeling at Valley Forge, or a Sherwood Eddy seeking the presence of God in all our human relationships will do more to deepen the spiritual lives of men than any great spectacle, however widely noted and successfully exploited by a sensational press.",
                "Let us not forget that we are ambassadors of God to a bleeding world crying from the depth of its suffering for the redemption of its body and its soul.",
                "We are heralding in the Kingdom of the Lord of Glory, messengers of reconciliation. How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace, that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation, that saith unto the Italians, \"Your God reigneth!\"",
                "This precious Gospel of ours cut its way through centuries of enthroned heathen supersitition and heathen morals. I can do it again if only it is proclaimed by those who know it to be true because they have lived it themselves.",
                "That wonderful man of God, Robert N. Sneer, the present Moderator of the General Assembly, in an address given on the evening of the Student Volunteer Convention at Detroit said: \"One is our Master, even Christ, and we have His clear command:",
                "\"'Go out and make disciples of all nations, teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.'",
                "\"It was His intention to release forces which would stir and overthrow the world of sin, destroying injustice and inequality, polygamy and slavery, child marriage, infanticide, and the oppression of the poor wherever these things, or anything else that is evil, should be found. And whenever they are found the Gospel of Jesus Christ (and the reawakening of Roman Catholicism) turn a pitiless light upon them and work to remove them. Our mission is not a cultural mission nor the offer of another religion. Our mission is the fulfillment of a trust, the offer of the only religion, the religion of Christ the Son of the living God.\"",
                "As for me, I consider it my sacred duty to offer to every Roman Catholic his only Savior and mine, Jesus Christ. The Jesuit fathers upon landing at Ellis Island proudly stated, \"We have come to make America Catholic.\" That is their business. One morning the great English architect, Sir Christopher Wren, while St. Paul's Cathedral was in process of construction, passed among his workingmen, most of whom did not know him, and of three men engaged in the same line of work he asked the same question, \"What are you doing?\" The first answered, \"I am cutting this stone.\" The second one's answer was, \"I am earning three shillings and six pence a day.\" But the third man straightened up, squared his shoulders, and holding his mallet in one hand and his chisel in the other proudly replied, \"I am helping Christopher Wren build this cathedral.\" Our business is to help God build His Kingdom.",
                "Of course there is nothing more futile than the attempt to make a prediction concerning great religious revivals. But I know that there is one coming very soon among our own people. When will it begin? Where will it be started? Who will lead it? What means will be employed?",
                "I have no suggestions to make, but I do know positively that the way of God in history may be likened to the course of those rivers which flow underground, breaking forth at last in astonishing volume and strength and when this happens, the gates of hell shall not prevail.",
                "Does the reawakening of Roman Catholicism interfere with our work? The answer is to be found in the 23rd chapter and the 28th verse of Jeremiah: \"The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully.

                "A few converters in brother Procopio's home began the present work by giving their testimony in the open air. Gradually the open street became our arena where the good fight of faith was waged. Today the pulpit that draws the largest audience is the rough curb-stone. There the spirit of God has time and again convicted men of sin. It is a known fact that the Parish Priest has at times led mobs of violent persecutors to break up such services, but last summer the tables were turned. While a meeting was being conducted in the heart of the colony, a large crown was reverently and attentively listening to the various speakers. A solemn hush seemed to be upon the crowd when, unexpectedly, there appeared the Priest of the Parish Church who interrupted the meeting by saying to the people, \"It is wrong for you to listen to such preaching\". To our amazement the unusual took place. God moved upon the people not to fear their false leader, but rather to disregard his conduct against us. Instead of dispersing the crowd as he had intended, on the contrary, their interest grew stronger as they gathered up closer to hear more of God's word and of the saving power of the Lord Jesus Christ. Blessed be His Name for the victory of faith. Thirty-one open meetings were held last summer, and approximately ten thousand people heard the Gospel message. One hundred and fifty came to the workers for spiritual advice and fourteen professed conversion.",
                "Meeting the People Where They Are",
                "The house to house visitation affords us an opportunity to meet and deal with the people where they are more apt to open their hearts to us. Last year one-thousand one hundred and thirty-four homes were visited with scripture reading and prayer as the main features of the call.",
                "The following is a typical visit as reported by Mrs. Rocca:",
                "Upon visiting a home just a few days ago, I offered a woman some Christian literature. With piercing black, shining eyes and countenance which was all but a pleasant one, she said: \"No, I shall never accept literature of such kind. I have holy books of my own to read, and furthermore I must observe the religion which my father taught me to observe.\" After having spoken for a moment, I told her that we are not responsible to God for the observance of any particular religion, but rather we must be saved by faith, through the blood of Jesus Christ our Lord. She was touched. Her countenance changed and immediately she invited me into her home. Soon I was brought before an image under which a light was burning. Many pictures of different saints hung on the walls, but she seemed more interested in the former one. \"See how devout I am\", she said.",
                "After such a statement I read to her Psalm 115, after which, in brief, the way of salvation was explained to her. By this time she became calm and serious. The eyes, that at the beginning looked piercing, now had a kindly, sweet expression. Just before leaving she said: \"Signorina, do you know that according to my religion I have committed a sin for speaking or allowing you to speak on these things? I must therefore confess it all to the Priest, because we are not even allowed to speak to Protestants. But it has been through courtesy that I have admitted you into my home and allowed you to speak to me of such things.\" More encouragingly she invited me to call on her again.",
                "Praise God for these open doors, where people are willing to admit us notwithstanding their false spiritual leaders."

                "On Sunday, Dec. 10, 1922, Superintendent Polemus H. Swift of the Chicago southern district, organized the quarterly conference of the Third Italian Methodist Church of Chicago, the official name being the Church of Our Saviour.",
                "This organization is housed in what formerly was the Second German M. E. Church, 2801 Princeton Avenue. This new development promises to become one of the best Italian churches in the city. The work was started a year ago by the organization of an Italian class in the Princeton Avenue M. E. Sunday School, where the Rev. J. J. Rankin was Pastor. This was in charge of the Rev. P. Buono, who still directs the work. He has put himself into the work body and soul. He is ably seconded by his wife and a number of devoted friends. Soon an Italian Sunday School was started, followed by an evening preaching service and later a regular prayer meeting.",
                "At the time the quarterly conference was organized, the Church was formally recognized with twenty-four full members and twenty-eight preparatory members. The Sunday School has an enrollment of 125 pupils with an average attendance of sixty pupils. The Junior Epworth League now forms a considerable feature in the work. Stewards, trustees and other officers were elected. One of the strongest Italian congregations in the city will, at no distant day, be found on this corner.",
                "Our Church membership has increased to sixty-two. The meetings are well attended. We praise God for all his blessings bestowed upon us this year. The Junior Epworth League has kept up the spirit of loyalty both winter and summer.",
                "The Daily Vacation Bible School, held for four weeks, has given us a new vision for the future. Almost a thousand children attended and received Bible instruction this summer.",
                "For two weeks we held revival meetings, in which many came to the knowledge of Christ and of His saving power. We had the privilege to have with us one evening, Dr. Louis Bucaletti, and on another evening, the Rev. A. F. Scorza. We closed the revival meetings with the Lord's Supper.",
                "Our prayer meetings are well attended, all taking part with prayer and testimony.",
                "We are sorry to lose our District Superintendent, P. H. Swift. He was compelled to retire on account of his health. This came out at the last day of the Annual Conference of the M.E. Church. Dr.Schultz has been elected to his place. We expect a great deal during the coming year from Dr. Schultz. He has promised me to come to our Church the first Sunday of December and hold the first quarterly conference for this new conference year."

During 1921 through the efforts of the Pastor, the associated Catholic Charities of Chicago dispensed to the needy parishioners $4,181.61. About 192 families, composed of 143 adults and 773 children received this assistance. Of 42 of these families, the mother is dead; in eight of these families, the father is dead; and six were deserted by the fathers.",

Those figures show the effort and interest taken by the Fathers of Holy Guardian Angel Church, in behalf of their parishioners in need of material and financial assistance.",
                "Besides the humanitarian work it is worth while mentioning the education given to the children. In 1920, the Rev. Ciufoletti erected a beautiful school building which is used by 400 children and divided into six classes with ten nuns as teachers. Besides English they teach Italian, music and singing.",

We have lost our illusion since it was openly told to us that Hull House does not want to sever the friendship with the Bishop of this Diocese of the Roman Catholic Church by allowing admittance to anti-clericals. I was commissioned by the Club Giordano Bruno, of which I am a member, to rent Bowen Hall, in Hull House. The club planned to hold an affair in that hall in commemoration of \"February 17,\" in honor of the great martyr for whom the club is named. I went to Hull House to carry out my commission. I was told that Miss J. Addams was sorry to refuse the use of the hall to the club, but the Catholics of Hull House were against the club and would not tolerate its presence. Because Hull House has classes in which aliens are taught to read and write, and classes in manual training for the young; because they sponsor a strong philanthropic organization known as the \"Juvenile Protection Association;\" because they have a public library branch, open every day; a theater which is rented to anyone; several meeting rooms also rented to anyone; because many organizers of foreign groups are taking advantage of these opportunities and are always using Hull House whenever they feel like it; and because Hull House is located near the foreign colonies in order to help and lead the newly arrived immigrants seeking an education and a better life; for these reasons, priests (with or without the white collar) are trying hard to control activities in Hull House and promulgate their ideas. This infiltration of the clergy was a subtle task which took a long time but was in the end successful.",
                "And now that they are in (allow us to say so, mesdames of the Hull House), yours is no more a free institution, because no institution in the world can be free under the domination of the clergy. Is it necessary to quote history? You have studied and are supplied with a vast background of culture, experience and knowledge. It seems to me that the experience of 18 centuries has taught you nothing, because not only do you tolerate the imposition of the Roman Church in your home, but you also take it in good humor. Your resolutions have changed with the years. Where has your liberal spirit gone--that spirit that urged you to erect Hull House on Halsted Street, among the foreigners, in order to help them?",

You naively believe that the Church may reform itself, and for that reason you acknowledge it. You believe that it is necessary for the people to have a religion, but you will soon realize that the Roman Catholic Church is not a religious institution, but a political party.",
                "Behold, your effort at the beginning was commendable, because you had good intentions, and in good faith accepted persons of any religious or political creed; you tolerated everything and everybody. But now that the priests are among you and the Church is imposing its will upon you, you no longer tolerate what the Church refuses to tolerate and you accept the impositions of certain bigots who influence you.",

We want to destroy the darkness created by the ignorance in which humanity is kept by the Church.",

                "Naturally curious, we hied ourselves to the hall, where we could be spectators to the dishonest drawing of the prizes. One prize, a piano,-still in the factory-, had the good fortune, by the will of God and the Committee, to be won by Father Giangrande, pastor of the Church of Saint Phillip Benizi. The second prize, a diamond ring, was won by the lady organist and director of the choir of this [same] church. Third prize, a lavaliere, was won by a reverend whose name escapes us. Before this evident mystification, the audience justifiably remonstrated to the committee. The priest, in words that were far from dignified, answered that luck so wished it. The man who had been extracting the winning numbers was removed and another put in his place. The last two prizes were then won by people other than priests, and so the public was satisfied. During the first nights of the bazaar, the attendance was rather heavy, and consisted of the faithful and devout, with a following of young girls and boys drawn by the dancing which the priest had wisely made a part of the attraction of the bazaar. The hall was transformed for the occasion into a shop for the sale of church items, such as [replicas of] madonnas and saints, and other objects the committee had acquired by begging for funds among the zealous and devout of the colony.",
                "All these things were being raffled during the dance by certain young ladies of the church, the priest having been advised by someone with experience that this was the best method of acquiring contributions from youths who might otherwise be reluctant to contribute. Eh! bravo Father Teta; we must acknowledge your shrewdness and astuteness in this matter; you are not like your predecessor of bad [reputation] who, unwilling to adapt himself to the exigencies, bravely stripped saints and madonnas and went in search of a more profitable flock. You, instead, show yourself more humble and benign towards your sheep in order to better shear them.",
                "Truly, these are the tactics which you ought to use in all your enterprises; but, unfortunately for you, we are always ready and on hand to unmask your underhanded actions."

It was immediately discovered, that the social and political status of our co-nationals in America hardly bore any resemblance to the status hitherto enjoyed by them in the world at large and, as a result, within a short time, efforts were put forth by many Italian leaders to organize our people here, and make of them a solid and unified whole.",

                "The Italo-American National Union is unquestionably among the strongest Italian organizations in America, and particularly in the State of Illinois. A list of the most important leaders will explain the growth of this organization and bear out, we feel sure, the assertion already made - Hon. Bernard P. Barasa, C. Vitello, P. Scaduto, V. E. Ferrara, T. H. Landise, Dr. S. Ingrao, C. Balzano, and others.",
                "The immediate object of this praise-worthy organization was that of uniting as many Italian immigrants, residing here, as conditions would permit and that, regardless of any province or territory whence they might have come. When this task was fairly well under way the organization, through its leaders, began toiling incessantly on the second part of the program, that is to say, the bringing of the younger Italian generation within the common fold.",
                "A few months ago, therefore, a resolution was passed by the Supreme Council, whose address is the general office of the organization at 8 S. Dearborn Street, Chicago, Illinois, thereby promoting the formation of juvenile groups within every lodge of the organization already made or to be made. The lodge \"Volturno\" was the first among them to fall into line and, then, its twin sister \"Umberto,\" No. 20 of Kensington, Illinois, rode the surf under the tireless guidance of F. Gasperini, its president. Within a short time a group of thirty-eight young men, all under eighteen years of age, was organized and a splendid baseball team formed. The necessary funds for the equipment were soon supplied by the Supreme Council, and that group of young Italian athletes was soon launched upon the field of Athenian competition.",
                "The team of Lodge No. 20 played several games and won four out of seven. It beat the \"Volturno\" team by a score of three to two, and battled the veterans of the Venetian Union to the losing end of a twelve to nine score.",
                "Riding on the enthusiastic crest of the baseball season, this group of Italian young men gave a ball on September 26, 1927, in the Venetian Hall at 135 Kensington Avenue and gathered there the very cream of the young girls and boys in the vicinity. The ball, as the rest of their active ties, was a complete success from every point of view; at present a basketball and a football team are well under way for the season of 1928.",
                "The moving spirit behind all these activities is unquestionably the Supreme Council, and particularly the chief officers in charge. They are seizing upon a need created here by the presence of many thousands of our countrymen, and are giving that need the proper solution and attention. A rough and threatening sea might suggest to all the sailors to seek refuge, or get out of the way, but it takes a well trained captain to suggest the right direction."

                "The official speaker, Prof. Andrew C. Mc Laughlin of the University of Chicago, who replaced Sir Gilbert Parker, brilliantly exalted with a cultured turn of phrasing the Italian origin and characteristics of Tonti.",

                "At the end of the speeches, Mrs. Holmes Forsyth, president of the Illinois Society of the Colonial Dames, and Miss Caroline McIlvaine, Librarian of the Chicago Historical Society, graciously expressed their appreciation for the fact that, at least, one Italian was present at the ceremonies, and Mr. Carnovale expressed the hope that this recognition of Tonti as an Italian, despite much American opposition which Mr. Carnovale had fought incessantly, was satisfactory to him.",
                "Then Miss McIlvaine, with much pleasure, showed Mr. Carnovale an original document bearing the signature of the great Italian explorer, Tonti. Mr. Carnovale looked with admiration on the authentic signature of the explorer.",

And, we think this very appropriate since Tonti was one of the first four white men to cross this territory."

No other historian or man of letters has been capable of vindicating the Italian origin of Tonti as well as Carnovale, and of exposing the motives of justice and gratitude that should urge the Americans to honor and perpetuate the memory of the great Italian explorer, Enrico Tonti.",

Parents love their children, not always wisely, but passionately. They work hard and long, many of them to give the younger generations better advantages in America than they of the first generation of immigrants had on either side of the sea. And their children expect, and are expected, to provide for their parents. The Italian immigrant's first earnings are usually shared with the old folks at home.",

Then, as one and another family circle begins to earn, a son and daughter add their wages to the family fund. Often the mother receives the unopened pay envelopes of father and children for household expenses and returns only a fraction of the week's wage for the personal expenses of each. A short-sighted Americanism complains of \"the loss\" of the money sent abroad, failing to appreciate that America has gained by this industrious thrift habit, and by the family love and loyalty thus cultivated and expressed.",
                "A Family Neighborly Folk",
                "Italians are neighbors to one another to a greater extent than most--if not all--people of other races. Their rural villagers and city dwellers alike possess that elemental instinct which causes them to cling to the neighborly relationship. The emigrant clings to it more consciously and tenaciously when leaving the fatherland, and shrinks from losing it while seeking to perpetuate it upon his coming to this strange land. In most cases, his only guiding policy is to go where his kinsfolk or neighbors have gone before him. His destination is where they happen to live. Whatever port he enters, he enters only to set foot on their threshold. He is hospitably taken into the family circle until he gains his foothold.",
                "They maintain their fellowship by sharing each other's joys at family festivals, at weddings, at baptisms, and at birthdays. By floral offerings and attendance at funerals, respect for the dead and sympathy for the living never fail to be displayed by every friend of both.",
                "Italians are naturally devoutly religious. They identify their church with their home and neighborhood. There they are at home. There the babe is brought for baptism, there the maid and her man come to be married, and from there the dead are taken for burial. The neighborhood is the parish. Its priest is as friendly as was the padre in the little hilltop parish where his parishioners grew up. The sanctuary worship and feasts inspire the little nativity shrine in the home circle and in the shop window, as well as the festa celebrated by every benefit order in honor of its patron saint.",
                "Familiar with art and music as expressions of religious feeling and aspiration, the Italian is inspired to create love, and to appreciate song and artistic beauty. Among the masses of the people of no other race among us, least of all among our American-born people, is there any such familiarity with operatic music, or appreciation for sculpture and painting, as there is among Italian wage-workers.",

                "The American citizenship of the Italians, like that of other foreign-born citizens, is better or worse according to the good or bad influences to which the immigrant is subjected during the early years of his experience in America. The man through whom he gets his first employment or under whom he works, usually interprets for the newcomer his first impressions of our political standards and practices.",
                "This \"boss\" is usually a partisan politician, who leads or drives the immigrant laborer to believe that his job depends upon his vote. Any higher ideals of citizenship reach the foreign laborer too late, if at all, and too superficially to prompt his declaration of independence.",
                "As the padrone gradually loses control of the Americanized foreign-born worker, and seldom controls the worker's children, the political \"boss\" eventually fails to exercise autocratic control over those who at first depended upon him for their very living. One of our political ward \"bosses,\" long since overthrown, sang his \"swan song\" in this lament: \"There's no telling what those immigrants will do inside the voting booth\".",
                "The great mass of Italian citizens are conservative, and are loyal Americans. But from Sicily, a lawless element has imported survivors of a lawlessness that has existed there longer than elsewhere because of weak and corrupt governments. Self protection at first drove self-respecting men to avenge themselves for injuries inflicted upon them. This demonstrated self-reliance. Failure to do so was looked upon with contempt. This expediency of self-protection against mis-government in earlier times evolved into the terrorizing agency of both crime and misrule.",
                "For Justice to Sicilians",
                "But the great majority of our good American citizens of Sicilian birth justly protested against being suspected of having any part or lot with these parasites of their race, from whose lawlessness they themselves have suffered most. Yet racial prejudice often causes unjust suspicion of all Sicilians--if not all other Italians--implying that they are accomplices of the very criminals whom they abhor.",
                "In our united effort to rid our land of this blood revenge and blackmail, we must not forget how long we have tolerated similar forms of American lawlessness. We have not yet dispensed with \"strong-arm\" ruffians on either side of our industrial conflicts. Antagonists seeking \"personal satisfaction\" have not long been extinct.",
                "Lynch law still survives, while Congress hesitates to stamp it out. The Ku-Klux are still abroad in the land. Bootlegger, gunmen and other assassins, not a few, bear other than Sicilian names. It will not help us to punish and deport the guilty if we are unjust to the innocent or if we discourage their loyal co-operation and support of American ideals."

                "When several years ago, another bill for the restriction of immigration, similar to the present Dillingham-Burnett bill, was before the Congress of the United States in Washington, one of the many worthy Americans who strongly opposed it was Charles Edward Russell, at that time Editor of the \"New York Journal\" and now a writer of repute, especially devoted to social and political questions and author of several splendid publications among which \"Why I am a Socialist\", \"The Uprising of Many\", \"Lawless Wealth\", \"Songs of Democracy\", etc. We remember a splendid editorial published by Mr. Russell in the Journal which created quite a sensation and was indeed one of the most noble defenses and enthusiastic eulogies of the Italian race.",
                "Now that all the narrow-minded politicians, helped and backed by the American Federation of Labor and by all the other enemies of European immigration, are all in arms trying to have the Senate pass a new immigration restriction law, barring from the American shores all people who are not literate, no matter how good, honest, willing and healthy they may be, we find great satisfaction in reproducing part of Mr. Russell's editorial, with which he makes a kind of appeal to the American people.",
                "ITALIANS LOVE LIBERTY.",
                "Can any of you imagine a source of political danger in the Italian immigration? You would forget in such a case, that the Italians have loved liberty more and much longer than the Anglo Saxon ever did, you would forget that Garibaldi and Mazzini were of Italian blood; you would forget that when the most absolute despotism reigned in dark England, Venice and Florence were republics.",
                "Can anyone think that we cannot absorb this race and that it could instead, outdo us and deviate our republic from its destiny? You do not know then with how much rapidity the Italians can assimilate our political customs; you don't know that his children crowd the public schools and are prouder than you are of their rights of American birth. You do not know and can not know that the most enthusiastic of all the Americans are the American children born of Italian parents.",
                "THE GREATEST BLOOD IN THE WORLD.",
                "Instead of impeding the Italian immigration, a wise and patriotic government should use every effort to encourage it; we are in need of all this immigration, because the Italian blood is the greatest blood in the world. Consider what it has been in history! Of this blood was the race which, on the point of the javelin drove civilization into the brains of barbarous Europe. From this blood came to us the first idea of order, or justice of organized society and art. When your ancestors were savages, immersed in the darkness of barbarism, in the solitude of Northern Europe, the people of this blood were building the Pantheons and wrote the codes of justice. When the idea of the Anglo-Saxon life was limited to a pirate boat and to one undefended city to be burnt, the savants of this blood discovered and saved precious manuscripts and Dante composed his immortal poem.",
                "For 1700 years since the birth of Christ, the measure of civilization of any tribe of Europe was the proportion of the Latin blood which flowed in its veins, was the extension of learning drunk from the fountains of Italian knowledge.",
                "Should we exclude this blood from our shores? We, whose artistic instincts are stereotyped in the complicated horrors of the enbankments of the Thames and in the indescribable, foggy obscurity of a street of London? We, who are trying to embellish our cities with buildings of 30 or 40 stories?",
                "BLESS EVERY STEAMER CROWDED WITH ITALIANS.",
                "No, if you are wise thank heaven for every steamer which arrives here crowded with Italians and pray for always, more to come. This is the blood which will always make impossible the monstrous and bloody phanthom of an Anglo-Saxon alliance; this is the blood which will make of America of the future the home of gold dug from the earth.",
                "What will this race be when the Anglo-Saxon tediousness and pertinacity will be illuminated and smoothened by the Italian sentiment of beauty? Never in history of the world has there been similar probability of success for such a race so free-minded, so enlightened, so progressive, so productive in art and every form of human energy, and we can rest assured that for the future of our nation, the more Latin element we will have with us, the higher and more elevated will be the final American type.",

For months past, the Century Magazine which effects to be a periodical of esthetic, culture, scholarship and fairness, has devoted much space to a series of articles reeking with race prejudice and religious rancor, seeking to prove that foreign immigration will soon over-throw our institutions and blight the hope of Democracy unless speedily and completely checked. The author of these articles is one, Edward Alsworth Ross, professor of sociology in the University of Wisconsin, a public institution supported by taxation of thousands of the people whom he so uncharitably and unjustifiably attacks.",
                "All impartial publicists and thinkers on the subject agree that our foreign immigration needs strict inspection, supervision and regulation to keep out the criminal, the diseased and the depraved; and that probably our laws should be amended so as to place our inspectors in foreign ports so as to turn back the unfit there, instead of from this side of the ocean, thereby overcoming the abuse of our laws, and the rights of poor emigrants by steamship companies and their agents, and as 98 per cent, all of our immigrations comes from 18 ports, this would seem reasonable and practicable.",
                "Professor Ross however seems to argue in favor of complete exclusion of immigration, especially from southern and eastern Europe, and in support of his theory he descends to depths of racial prejudice, religious bigotry and palpable misrepresentation to show him to be wholly unfit for the public position which he holds.",
                "Edmund Burke, the great philosophic statesman, said that you cannot indict a whole people. The reckless writer finds no difficulty in indicting many people and in seeking to support his indictment with charges that range from the ridiculous to the malicious. He is especially unfair to the Italians, the Jews, the Poles, Hungarians, Bohemians, the Greeks and all of the people of the Slovenian race. He scoffs at their mentality, their morals, their religions, \"their coarse present philosophy of sex,\" their willingness \"to take jobs requiring nothing but brawn\" and lack of style, and contemptuously says that their souls\" burn with the dull, smoky flame of the pineknot stuck to the soil. Has he not borrowed this vocabulary of snobbish scorn from what those other college professors said of Abraham Lincoln sixty years ago? He slanders the Jewish people by saying that \"obedience to parents seems to be dying out among the Jews.\" and that this laxity of home and family life \"results in a great number of Jewish girls going astray.\"",
                "Nothing could be farther than the truth. The loyalty of the Jews to home and kindred is proverbial and the chastity of their womanhood is the brightest gem in the diadem of Hebraism. He violates truth and decency also in speaking of the Italian people who he says are infected with spiritual hookworm.\" This is a foul slander on a people whose present faith and spirituality have made their country the hub of Christiandom for thousands of years and give their music, art, architecture, poetry and philosophy a touch of the divine. His condemnation of the Poles, Hungarians, Bohemians, and other Slavonian people, is equally incharitable and untrue. He condemns those people as dirty, ignorant, superstitious and says, \"they simply look out of place in black clothes and stiff collars, since clearly they belong in skins, in wattled huts at the close of the great ice age.",
                "These ox-like men are descendents of those who always stay behind. Anyone who has mingled along and done business with those great people know how unwarranted is this wholesale condemnation. How much truer is the estimate of these people given by John Cowyer Towys, the renouned Cambridge lecturer, who sees in them the qualities of a virile manhood and virtuous womanhood that is destined to be one of the greatest factors in the replenishing and developing of advancing Democracy.",
                "Prof. Ross even fears that the second and subsequent generations of these foreigners on American soil will be worse than the original aliens, and says that they will develop \" a degenerate class, such as been fully developed among the Irish.\"",
                "If the achievements of the exiles of Erin and their descendants in America is what he calls degeneracy, God grant that we may have more of it. He condemns especially the Germans and Bohemians of Chicago, \"marshalled in the United Charities, which he says is merely a corrupt machine\" through which the brewers and liquor dealers may sway a foreign vote not only in defense of liquor, but also in defense of other corrupt and afflicted interests. \"He calls from a list of candidates for offices in Chicago, the following names: Kelly, Cassidy, Slattery, Alschuler, Phaelzer, Bartzen, Umback, Anderson, Romano, Knitchoff, Deneen, Hogue, Burres, Short, and says of these men who include many of the finest types of progressive, public spirited citizens in American life,\" the humor of calling Anglo-Saxon the kind of government these men will give is obvious. We would like to ask this pedigogical Anglo maniac why an \"Anglo-Saxon\" is necessary or even desirable in this country. He objects to America being the broad melting pot of vigorous humanity, but is willing to have it remain a mere jack-pot for British capital.",
                "The same arguments were made by his predecessors of the \"Know Nothing Party,\" just prior to the Civil War. It slumped into infamy when our flag needed defenders and it's croakings were hushed by the Huzzars of 300,000 Germans and a quarter of a million Irish men and hundreds of thousands of brave men of other lands who answered Father Abraham and the bugle calls of duty. They said then, as he says now, that America is crowded and must close it's doors. It is not so. As a college professor he should know that Germany with an area not as large or fertile as Texas, supports in comfort 70,000,000 of the most prosperous and progressive people on earth. Political economists have estimated that the United States alone, under just and equitable laws, is capable of supporting comfortably within it's borders two thousand million people and then it would not be as congested as Belgium, whose people matches any in the world in prosperity, peace, morality, intelligence and culture.",
                "Civilization, like trees wither and die at the top and are nourished and replenished from the bottom through the common soil. Balzac was right when he said that the stairways of progress are always resounding to the clatter of wooden shoes going up, and the rustle of silken shirts and patent leather coming down. America, like England, through the teaching of such as Professor Ross, is mildewed over with materialism and a decadence of high ideals and spirituality. It needs the spiritual, emotional and vital elements that are being brought hither by the rugged emigrants as much as these emigrants need America.",
                "Winnowing out the unworthy, let us still welcome the honest, healthy and thrifty of all these people with full faith in the prophesies of democracy that in the mysteries alembic of God the manhood metals of these mighty people may be mingled and out of the transfusion of composite America, the superman of tomorrow."

The literacy test clause of the Immigration bill, therefore, principally affects the people of Latin and Slavonic nations. Many of these people have been denied the opportunity of learning to read, but this clean peasant stock, from the standpoint of the biologist and eugenist is preferable, from which to propagate the future American, to the descendants of some of the inhabitants of the congested cities of Europe who like as not are afflicted with diseases incident to unhealthful occupations and to the vices of the underworld.",
                "More important than the literacy test is the Wasserman test of the blood. Mendel's law of heredity points to the importance of breeding the dominant rather than the recessive. Dominance in human breeding is not the result of literacy capacity but of a healthy, clean and honest heredity.",

                "Chief Justice Olson of the Municipal Court of Chicago, recently related the following story: A negro in Chicago, whose first name is Ike, used to complain to me that he was born in slavery and could not read nor write. He had a good mind in a sound body and was capable and successful. Finding it frequently necessary to commiserate with him, I finally printed out to him that he was more fortunate than perhaps he realized. \"Ike,\" I said, \"if you were a stick of wood in the lumber-yard, which would you rather be, a piece of solid mahogany in the rough or a piece of polished mahogany full of worm-holes?\" Ike saw the point and never complained again, but was proud of the fact that he was dominant.",

Had such a ruling been enforced some generations ago, it would have nipped a goodly number of our best families in the bud.",
                "We do not know how far back in their family histories a majority of congressmen and senators would have to go before they ran into illiteracy, but reasonable patience would reward them all with success at length. If this were a reflection upon anybody we should not mention it here. Since it is not, the reminder may serve a good turn. The most dangerous visitors from Europe to America are perfectly qualified to pass a test in reading and writing. Under the proposed law they will come and go at will while tens of thousands who seek only an opportunity to apply their industry in wholesome labor will be sent back over the ocean.",
                "We have a cure for illiteracy in our public schools, and in every immigrant family there is a passionate desire to embrace that opportunity. Exclude the physically and morally unfit, if you will, but do not put up the bars against the untaught of Europe who still look to America as a land of refuge and opportunity."

He eats better food, dresses better, lives in an environment more elevated, and comes in contact with people more advanced. He feels the desire to improve himself and the need to learn more. But even if he does not improve his education, one thing will happen beyond any doubt; he will send money to Italy, and this money will help his children to become educated.",

This country has room for a billion people, and if to-day there is an excess of labor, it is not the fault of labor, but of the baroque system of capitalism, which every so often slows up production because of a slow market, despite the fact that the majority of the people have nothing but the barest necessities.",
                "And what is the Italian Government doing about it thru its representatives in this country? If the American Government were to forbid the importation of macaroni and wine, perhaps they would be moved to protest or to set up tariff walls on American products. But it affects only the workers, whose flight from Italy and low wages to countries where the wage-standards are much higher is looked upon with disfavor by the Italian Government and the ruling classes, who see in this exodus the reason for the growing independence of the workers who remain behind.",
                "That is the reason why the Italian Government is not concerning itself with the Burnett-Dillingham bill and is not interested in defeating it.",
                "America needs all classes of immigration; it needs literates and illiterates, the strong-minded and the strong-armed. The greatness of this nation is due to the unrestricted influx of immigration. The harm done by the illiterate immigrant is more than compensated for by his children, who grow up not only literate, but with the perfect American attitude.",
                "The American people will not be the first to experience the harm done by such foolish laws. Australia has had a similar law for several years and at the present time is preoccupied with the problem of increasing its population, following the example of France and trying to effect an increase in the birthrate.",

The thousands of railroad and mine workers, undoubtedly, constitute a large portion of the number.",
                "In our city the Italian population lived in rather secluded colonies until this day. The largest settlement is located at Ewing, Taylor, Halsted Streets, and Blue Island Avenue. But we also find a large Italian element on South Clark Street between the viaduct and Harrison Street, and also on Clark Street and Archer Avenue, West Van Buren, Robey, Throop Streets and Hoyne Avenue, and elsewhere.",
                "The first Italian immigrants arrived about 1845 on the shores of Lake Michigan. During the following ten years very few new-comers appeared. Among the first settlers were Antonio Repetto, Antonio Raggio, J. Raggio, L. Arado, Frank Gazzolo, Dominich Botto and J. G. Cella. The last mentioned are supposed to be the richest Italians in this city.",

                "The organ-grinders, passing through our streets begging, the ash-box investigators, male and female, the Italian street-cleaners and diggers are familiar to all. However, the great majority of the Italians occupy an honorable position among the population of the city.",
                "During recent years the Italians have obtained citizenship in real large numbers, and many of them are striving earnestly to overcome a certain prejudice against their nationality due, undoubtedly, to some street types, and they have been rewarded with splendid success.",
                "The average Italian is very economical, and with grinding frugality he saves his earnings in order to purchase his own home. The overwhelming majority of the Italians have succeeded through tireless efforts to become wealthy or at least to live in moderate circumstances.",
                "The Italians are strongly inclined to be social. Their many social clubs also give evidence to what extent they treasure the memory of their old fatherland. Many of the Italian organizations bear the names of Italian cities or provinces. The oldest society is the \"Unione e Frattellenza\" (Unity and Brotherhood). Well known are the Italian Sharpshooters with their colorful uniforms. There are many other clubs as the Garibaldi, Victor Emanuel, Margherita de Savoy, Christophoro Columbo, Carabinieri, Italia, etc. There are also a number of fraternal organizations and one of the strongest is the Italian Catholic Fraternity of Foresters.",

What could be nobler than what is symbolically expressed in our insignia, \"Liberty, Equality and Brotherhood.\"",
                "It is beyond my humble capacity to try to express my innermost feelings towards you as brother members, therefore, in order to show further my appreciation, I accepted with joy the invitation tendered to me by our most worthy leader, Chevalier J. Spatuzza, attorney, to contribute to the mentioned bulletin.",
                "The choice of my topics for discussion is guided by several motives. I shall briefly mention what I consider the principal ones.",
                "First of all we must remember that the requisite of good citizenship is not only the knowledge and obedience of the fundamental laws of a nation, but also some knowledge of the historical background upon which the nation was founded. The historical background to which I am referring, as a scientist, is the historical development of science including the great men who made such epochal history. The nation in question is our great country, Italy.",
                "With this knowledge in reserve we are able to inform our friends of other nations what constitutes the very essence of our great Italian civilization. On the other hand, they shall then be better able, if they are willing to accept facts, to conclude for themselves what the world owes Italy.",
                "The historical background is necessary in order to fully appreciate the significance of the present problems facing us, because the future of a nation or an individual, with absolutely no exception, depends on its past as well as on its present state of affairs. In short, it depends upon the very foundation upon which it was originally built. If built on solid ground, so to say, we are certain to advance with radiant colors, but if built on quicksands we are certain to perish in shameful defeat.",
                "In order to fulfill the above purpose I shall therefore take up the historical development of such sciences as mathematics, physics, astronomy, chemistry, medicine, etc.",
                "I do hope that the program outlined above will serve its purpose, and spur you on to further individual study. It is with that hope that I am devoting my time to such writings.",
                "(Signed) Amelotte Emilio",
                "E. N. Prof. Emilio Amelotte of the University of Chicago, in graciously accepting an invitation to write for the bulletin, has rendered the Order an invaluable service if the Order has the very important task of contributing to and fostering the mental education of its members.",
                "His articles, treating subjects of general interest, should especially appeal to the ever increasing number of college boys and girls who every day join us.",
                "Being part and parcel of the new generation of Italo-Americans upon whom depends the future of our Order and the prestige of our race, Professor Amellotte's efforts are primarily directed to those from whom he expects a cordial response.",
                "The editor, in tendering Professor Amellotte sincere thanks, hopes that his articles not only meet with the approval of our readers but that they may prove to be an incentive to others that they may follow on the path he has blazed."

In my letter I urged each and everyone of you to do your utmost for this worthy cause and to remit the contributions you would collect, either to the Venerable of your Lodge or to the office of the Grand Lodge.",

At the time this money was turned over to Commandatore Carosi, I assured him that this was merely the first donation on the part of the Order.",

I hope and trust that you will have collected by that time, if not already, something on behalf of this noble cause. I want to also remind you that many pieces of gold, such as rings, earrings, and so forth, were collected by many of our members and turned over to the office of the Grand Lodge. I want you also to do all you can in this regard. The names of all who contribute either money, regardless of the amount, or gold, will be given due publicity. By all means do not forget to turn over the subscription blanks as we must account for each and everyone sent out. It is needless for me to remind you that you need contributions among members only, but in your list you may include any and all who desire to contribute to this humanitarian act on our part.",
                "In soliciting funds do not conclude that it is too late, or that everyone has contributed, because in the state of Illinois only about $30,000 has been collected so far and there are, in this state, more than a half million of our people.

                "Italians? The Americanized Italian who has found America quite to his taste and consequently has learned to live according to American standards knows well enough what to do with his money and where to put it. Though the Italian has become thoroughly Americanized, traces of the old soil still cling to him. The Americanized Italian may have American-born children, but even these children develop an unconscious love for Italy which is easy to perceive. Living in America and earning American wages have made the Italian and descendants loyal to their adopted country. Yet try as they will, they cannot eradicate the instincts that have been carried down through the ages and incorporated in their very heart-beats. They are forced to sympathize with their fellow-countrymen by the intense feelings of their ardent natures which, once aroused, are hard to quench. This indomitable love for their own kind causes them to trade in stores, of which Italians are the proprietors.",
                "The same tendency is even more apparent in their habit of banking. The country is dotted with countless Italian banks. One of these small foundations has developed into a large chain of banks operated by a kind and understanding Italian-American.",
                "Many of the smaller Italian banks receive money from their depositors only to turn it over to this larger institution for safe-keeping. There are also a few ambitious Italians whose aim is to found more chain banks and thereby increase banking facilities for their depositors. In spite of the fact that they deposit their money in banks, poor Italians hope some day to own their own homes. This is another instinct born of their original soil. Home to the Italian is his altar of rest as the church is his altar of hope.",
                "Every young, old, or middle-aged Italian desires above everything else a home of his own. Italians save money with this end in view. Since they do not believe in installments, they prefer to save a large sum first and then buy land or a house outright. In many cases they prefer to buy land, knowing well that Mother Earth is their safest bet, and that she will give them food besides a home. The farming instinct, too, is pre-eminently characteristic of the Italian. To save a certain sum and then buy land with it is what nine hundred and ninety-nine Italians out of a thousand do or hope to do some day. Mother Earth can never fail them. If they cannot build a house right away, they can get potatoes, corn, and cabbages out of the soil and thereby subsist. Thrift is second nature to the Italian; he can very often afford to buy real estate outright, but if he cannot, he pays off his mortgage scrupulously and exactly. To him a home is safer than a bank account. It means more. Land doubles the value of a bank-book. So the Italian chooses a home first and then looks around for a convenient friendly bank in which to deposit his savings. But, although he has been in the United States for twenty years, he will always choose a place where he can tread on familiar ground, one with Italian characteristics.",

His name, of course, is well known to all the Italians in Chicago and environs because he gave us Ravinia with all her natural grandeur, and the exuberance of Italian operas and Italian singers. He gave it to us with all the generosity of a great heart and with all the enthusiasm of a noble artist, and when we heard that the king of Italy had conferred upon him the decoration of Commendatore of the Crown of Italy, we were overwhelmed with joy. At the Italian Chamber of Commerce we are even more enthusiastic as we have the honor of including Commendatore Eckstein as one of our life members."

It gives Italians of any creed the opportunity of seeing again their charming and blessed land of origin, transformed by the strenuous efforts of a restoring government; to go back and see again and embrace your dear one; it has, above all, a great patriotic meaning since it will bring to light the Evangelists, who in accomplishing, in this country, their noble mission of faith, do not omit any opportunity to prove their sentiments of Italisnism.",

We wish to draw everyone back to reality and to express a clear judgment.",

Mussolini has solved the Roman question, the solution of which had been attempted by other governments which were non-Catholic, and we firmly believe that he has been capable of putting an end to the pretenses of temporal or secular dominion of the Pope's limiting this dominion to a very small zone known as the City of the Vatican, but which is no more than a long leased concession, controlled by the Italian government.",

                "Coming to the point, then, on the question of religious freedom, we approve that historic act from the moment in which it had his sanction and we have joined our voice and sentiments of joy to those of our brothers in Italy, who were the first to enthuastically praise and bless that solemn act of the Mussolini government, in the press and in public speeches.",
                "Any criticism, comment or discussion, therefore, that may be made in America by our colleagues or anyone else, gives us to think that they interest themselves in matters that do not concern them. Those really and truly interested innthat question are our colleagues in Italy and they have unanimously demonstrated their approval.",

Those gentlemen, he added, would do better to employ their time in spreading the Gospel among the Italians in America.",

                "With this premise, that the accord between the Italian government and the papacy will not in the least affect our faith and our religious principles, the fruit of ponderous reflection and long experience. We must explicitly state that in spite of our religious ideas, which are free from fanaticism and prejudice, we are still in sympathy with Fascism and the Duce because he has merely brought to completion an accord which had been maturing for many years, and which other governments had also tried to achieve.",

Paul Boiso, who has come here from Rome, where he is pastor of the Cornelius Baker Memorial Church, to conduct a short mission of five lectures in five Waldensian religious centers has words of unconditional praise for the work of reconstruction begun by Mussolini in Italy. He says that Italy, which after the war was on its way to the abyss of bolshevism, has found in him an anchor of security. Mussolini is a profound thinker with a program which, though arduous, he will nevertheless carry to successful completion.\"",

But he transformed that mass of citizens into invincible soldiers who fought and won eleven battles. He was unfortunate and unjustly accused but the Fascist government, aware of his heroism, genius, and military doctrine, promoted him to Marshal, and he was once again an expert adviser on the reorganization of the new army.

                "The origin of this phrase is, plainly, of a material or physical order. Experience teaches us that when we place a finger in the wound, with some degree of pressure, we feel pain, more or less acute, all according to the amount of pressure. This is the literal meaning of the phrase. But men have given it another meaning of a moral order. When the teacher says to his pupil, \"You are not doing your duty,\" he is doing nothing more than putting \"his finger in the wound,\" that is, he produces disgust, revolt and displeasure in the heart of his pupil who, certainly, is not pleased with the reprimand, much as he may have merited it.",

Evil wills to dominate despotically and indisputably. If some one urged by a sense of goodness and justice has to raise his voice against injustice, adultery, drunkenness, pimping, corruption, peculation or immorality in general then a deafening chorus of protest is heard to emerge from the shady depths of the lawless, the degenerate the defrauders and what have you. The bombs begin to explode here and there; the attempts occur with chronometric regularity; and violence reigns everywhere. It is the spirit of hell that breaks with all its fury over the good, the just, and the champions of order, right and duty.",
                "It is the story of humanity! In the world - there are two forces: the good and the evil. And in the fight neither side is giving any quarter. How many the victims, how many the defeats. The good have succumbed many times but they have also triumphed. But what a price they paid for their victories. Blood will flow in rivers until the good cause triumphs. It is the law of the universe.",

Can anyone destroy or doubt these facts?",

But, by whom? By Fascism whose soul is Benito Mussolini. Yes, that same Mussolini whom many hate, and would like to murder. It is history repeating itself.",
                "Mussolini has \"put his finger in the wound.\" He is therefore hated by professional intriguers, by the lawless, by the spirits of disorder and dissolution, who enjoy fishing in turbid waters. Let us give, first of all a retrospective look on the pre-Fascist Italy. What a picture of horror forms before our eyes. The political, financial, moral and spiritual disintegration has reduced Italy to a mound of ruins. The factories, offices and mills that are a barometer of Italy's prosperity, are closed. There are wars between brothers and blood flows in streams.",

Mussolini desires victory for justice; he wishes to purify that unhealthy area that threatens to suffocate the springs of material, moral, spiritual, financial, civic and political well-being of Italy. Mussolini believes in calling a spade a spade; adultery is adultery, abuse is abuse, fraud is fraud, immorality is immorality. And there is the reason for so much enemity against him.",

Consult those who are on the inside of Italian affairs and can therefore speak with authority. They will tell you that Italy is heading with gigantic strides towards complete regeneration and that it is the only country in Europe where there is order and plethoric blooming of every good initiative.",

Gualano, in an article, which appeared in the February issue of this magazine, wrote the following on this question: \"And so arose the Fascist revolution amusing itself by giving castor oil to the bad ones as one does with certain impertinent children. Impetuously and with sublime aspirations it arose to carry light where existed only chaos. Through Duce Benito Mussolini, backed by King Victor, the Third, the regeneration of the people was accomplished. And this people, now, loftily walks as it never had walked in the past, energetically, ardently, sure of the future. While peoples of other races, while muttering over certain small and inevitable imperfections, look on with admiration.\"",
                "Ex-Judge Gualano speaks with cognizance of his subject and millions of others do likewise. They have seen things with their own eyes and, freed of passions, sectarianisms and prejudices, they have told the plain, unadorned truth.",
                "Italy of today has unlimited credit. America and England, the two colossi of international finance, vie with each other in loaning money to Italy. This fact is symptomatic. It means that Italy is moving ahead with confidence in herself. The lira is on a sound financial basis and the ship of state is in full sail. Naturally, we do not pretend that Italy is a heaven on earth. Humanity carries with it the germ of pain. Evil, despite energetic corrective measures, creeps in everywhere.",
                "It is said that in Italy many are dissatisfied. It could not be otherwise. They who enjoyed the fruits without the labor, blaspheme Fascism because it has taken from them their easy living as Gualano says in his article. Others blaspheme because they have lost the freedom of writing their improprieties and bestialities for the newspapers. But their motives cover them with ridicule.",
                "Let us consider Italy as a whole. Then we shall see a work of Titans that is being accomplished, incessantly and inexorably. Against the horizon there is outlined a greater Italy, respected and feared. The defects are no more than shadows that give bolder relief to the silhouette.",
                "There is the Italy of Mussolini; beautiful, prosperous, robust, filled with energy and filled with faith in itself, that securely treads the path to a future filled with glory.",
                "The numerous groups of enemies is an infallible proof of its high value. All the noblest enterprises have had their implacable enemies. It is the law of the universe. Even Christ was not excepted from that law. More glory, therefore, to our great Duce Mussolini who fearlessly could put \"his finger in the wound\" at the opportune moment. Italy is in good hands. May God keep a vigil over its destinies, present and future.",

Between America and Italy there is no room for political dissension; we have the same ideals; we both love our independence and our freedom, and we both wish international intercourse governed by equity and justice toward all the civilized peoples of the world. At the Washington conference we, the Italian delegates, have always been in perfect agreement with the American delegation. America did not intervene at the Genoa Conference. Nevertheless, even the press of the opposition had to admit some good has been achieved there, namely, at Genoa.",

Commerce is made of interchanges, and it seems quite natural that one should buy wheat, oil, coal or leather where the sale of his own products will, to a certain extent, open the credit necessary for his purchases. A few days ago I read in one of your most authoritative newspapers, the Chicago Journal of Commerce, an article in which Europe was described as a beggar; and in which an expert of finances, posing as a new Isaiah prophesies the bankruptcy of Europe in a few years from now. Now, I know the importance of the Chicago Journal of Commerce and of the press in general in forming public opinion.",

Italy does not perform miracles and she does not claim anything of that kind, but Italy is gradually rebuilding the finances of the state and her commercial economy. Don't take a lone instance and draw from it a general conclusion. Don't let yourselves be deceived by mere hearsay. Read instead of the annual financial report of our treasury department, which is a clear and sincere document. If a bank asks for a moratorium, don't draw a general conclusion but look around and you will see that even here, poorly managed banks are sooner or later destined to bankruptcy.",

Well, my Government asked me to thank them for the offer but to refuse it because the national saving furnish to the state, all the money it needs, and flows to the treasury in such amount that the interest on Treasury Bonds had to be reduced a month ago from 6 per cent to 5 1/2 per cent.",

                "Our bankers got their experience - a hard experience if you will, but an instructive one - from their debtors who were the same Englishmen from whom, ethnically are descended many of your best financiers. In fact, it was to be Bardy and Peruzzi of Florence who had loaned, respectively, 180,000, and 135,000 pounds in gold to the Kingdom of England, that King Edward the Third presented an unpleasant surprise with his Decree of May 6, 1309. In this Decree he ordered that the payment of the debt to Italian bankers, should be delayed indefinitely, and the delay has been perpetual. At that time an English king cancelled his debt toward his Italian creditors; but modern Italy never asked any creditor to cancel her debts.",

Well, why don't you act in a businesslike fashion and go to Italy and see for yourselves; but listen, don't waste too much of your time visiting the Coliseum, St. Peter's, Capri and Sarrento.",

Visit our banks, our factories, our power producing plants, visit our shipyards; go and see our fields, our orchard, our vineyards, without including too much where the good wine is stored! Go deep into our financial, commercial and industrial life and form your own personal opinion. I am ready to give you as many introductions as you may want to our leading institutions. But let me say that you will not have any use for them. I tell you it with pride; every American who come to our shores is welcomed, and he will find himself at home as a brother among brothers.",

Although the hall was full of respectable people, particularly Italians, you cannot deny that the dregs of the colonial underworld, were present also, disguised as ladies and gentlemen; such as the self-called doctors, and lawyers, the country upstarts made wealthy in business, and similar vermin - which emerge at every occasion, even at the price of polluting the good reputation of Italo-Americans.",
                "Why all this rumpus made by the wiseacre press, like the Tribuna Transatlantica, against Judge Barasa, because his speech at the banquet was only a few minutes long? Strangely enough, the same press is apt to accuse Barasa of not being able to speak the Italian language well - not realizing that the number of Italians in Chicago who can speak their native tongue is very small.",
                "It is not my intention to defend Judge Barasa. To me they are all alike, and to be frank, I do not give a damm for any judge or consul. But it would not be fair to blame Mr. Barasa for his inability to speak Italian, when one considers that most of those top-hutted and frock-coated guests knew less of the language than Mr. Barasa or myself, a poor manual laborer.",
                "However, the real cause for criticism seems to lie, not in his lack of knowledge of the language, but in his overbearing manner toward the country upstarts, remodeled into \"gentlemen,\" who presume to overlord the colony.",

                "Dear Sir:",
                "We take great pleasure in informing you that at the meeting of the Board of Directors of the Chicago Italian Chamber of Commerce held last Friday, August 11, a resolution was unanimously passed, thanking you for submitting to the Senate the resolution relative to the appeal of the City of Fiume which, we understand, has been referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.",
                "We beg to call your attention to the recent Austrian memorandum to the Peace Conference on the attitude of the different people of former Austria toward this state before and during war, which the Conference kept secret, but which a correspondent of the Chicago Daily News succeeded in obtaining, and an analysis of which was published in the issue of July 9, of the Daily News.",
                "This memorandum states that the Austria-Hungarian monarchy made the war among other reasons, in the interest of the Croats and Slovaks against the Italians; that the war against Italy was popular with Jugo-Slavs then subject to Austria; and that the Jugo-Slav soldiers were among the best and most faithful in the Hapsburg armies. The representative of the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovaks at the Peace Conference, Dr. Ivan Zolger, is a former member of the Austrian war cabinet.",
                "Austria fought, according to the memorandum, so that the Jugo-Slavs might prevail over the Italians, and this combat represented the apotheosis of the historic struggle between the Italians and Jugo-Slavs for the Adriatic coast.",
                "The Austrian memorandum further declares that when the Jugo-Slavs, for whom the war was fought and who today are still fighting for the same ends, designate their comardes in arms of yesterday as the principal criminals in the war, or even as their adversaries in the war, they are flinging a challenge in the very face of truth.",
                "It is therefore quite apparent that the responsibility for the war is shared alike by the Jugo-Slavs, formerly subject to Austria, and by Germany and it is difficult to understand why, while the latter country is to be severely punished, its accomplices, the Croats and Slovaks of Austria are to be glorified and have been made the object of so much tender care and solicitude by the American delegation to the Peace Conference, notwithstanding the fact that in this war they were fighting the United States, as well as Italy and other allied nations. If the Italian population on the eastern shores of the Adriatic is to be delivered into the hands of the most bitter enemies, who are now planning to revive under another name the defunct Austrian power, the 500,000 lives, and the wealth which Italy give to the cause of freedom, will have been sacrificed with the result of perpetuating the very conditions which her glorious victory was forever to end.",
                "Italy is, and has always been, willing to concede to the Jugo-Slavs all that they may be justly entitled to, and to allow and even to help with the full development of their national life, as well as their commercial activities, but she should not be compelled to crucify herself in order to testify to the false claims and exaggerated pretentions of her foes.",
                "As American citizens, for the love that we bear this country of our adoption and for its honor, we sincerely trust that the United States will never consent to be a participant in this injustice, unparalleled in history, or in this crime against humanity.",
                "It will probably be objected that the proposed League of Nations will afford a remedy against the evils Italy fears. We think that it is extremely doubtful whether the League will accomplish all that is expected of it in certain quarters. England and France are evidently of the opinion that it will not, since they are seeking protection against aggression in a special agreement, or alliance, with this country while such protection should be sufficiently furnished by the League. If we are to make an alliance of this kind with those countries, then why not with other powers also for similar or other purposes? We take this opportunity of expressing to you our belief that while it is most likely that the United States will be unable entirely to keep clear of many future European complications, the best interests of this country require that it may be free to meet circumstances as they arise, and that it should not be committed in advance to any alliance with England, France, or any other nation, and particularly to any agreement as one-sided as the proposed one.",
                "The National Council of Fiume, in its proclamation of October 28, 1918, announcing the annexation of that city to Italy, declared that it placed its decision under the protection of \"America, Mother of Liberty.\" We dare say that our feeling or pride in the trust expressed by the people of our blood across the sea in this, our adopted country, was shared by all the several million citizens of Italian birth or descent in the United States. The American delegation to the Peace Conference, unfortunately, did not respond to the appeal of the Italians formerly subjects of Austria, and they now are looking for justice and relief to that august body, the Senate of the United States. We confidently believe that they will not do so in vain. We hope that the Senate will pass the resolution favoring the just claims of the Italian Government, and should the Conference not heed it, that it will refuse to ratify the treaty of peace with Austria, unless it specifically provided for the annexation of Fiume, as well as the rest of Istria, Trieste, the Trentino, and such parts of Dalmatia as Italy is entitled to under the Treaty of London with Italy.",
                "America, we believe, is still the \"Mother of Liberty.\" Using the power of the United States, in clear defiance of the principle of self determination, to crush a population which has announced its will to be a part of the Italian nation, and which is Italian by all historical, geographical and cultural, as well as ethnological, reasons is a proposition which has no place in any vision of the American people.",
                "It has been reported that at some date in the near future you, may come to Chicago to address the people on the vital issues of the day. We wish to assure you that, should you decide to do so, many thousand citizens of our nation will be glad to hear you and cordially welcome you.",

                "The views of the Italian Chamber of Commerce in Chicago on the question of official recognition by the Italian Government of Italian Chambers of Commerce in Foreign Countries, have been clearly stated in the reply of the Chicago Chamber to the report of the Paris Chamber regarding the proposed recognition, and to that reply we add this memorandum.",
                "The Italian Government's decree of October 13, 1918 issued after our reply to the above mentioned report, confirms our opinion that as far as the Italian Chambers of Commerce in America are concerned, and particularly our local organization, any legislative measure that attempts to regulate their functions is not applicable and cannot be approved by us at any cost.",
                "The decision which we have made was based partly, but not entirely, on Article 5 of the Decree, which states that anyone who has lost his Italian citizenship is not entitled to take part in Chamber affairs with any authority whatever. Considering that out of 122 active members, all but two have requested and obtained their American citizenship papers, it is not difficult to understand how that article above might suffice to justify our decision. Nor can we be prevailed upon to change that decision because of the modification offered by the Minister of Commerce, which states that, at least, two-thirds of the active members be Italian by birth or origin.",
                "We believe that any measure that tends to regulate the nationality of our membership might complicate the work of this Chamber, which we hope and desire to see strongly seconded and strengthened by banks, commercial institutions, and others, managed by persons other than Italian, and we take this stand knowing that the element of Italian origin in this Chamber will always predominate.",
                "Article 7 states that Royal diplomatic and consular agents and commercial attaches must be permitted to share in the sessions of the Executive Council. The present Italian Consul for Chicago, Count Bolognesi, has been present at our meetings many times by request, and his views were heard with the dutiful deference owed to one whom we esteem as one of the Honorary Presidents of this organization and for the authority which he represents. But between an invitation which we tender freely, and an obligation imposed by governmental decree runs a vast difference. Our relations with the present Consul are very pleasant and in case of a change in personnel, relations might not be so pleasant with a new incumbent.",
                "Article 8 requests that the Secretary of the Chamber be acceptable to the Minister of Commerce and that he be an Italian citizen, conditions which we cannot consider favorably, and which would be difficult to carry out.",
                "But without going further into the decree or the articles which to us seem unsatisfactory, the fact on which this Chamber bases its opposition, is the principle of a double jurisdiction proposed by the Paris Chamber of Commerce in the report previously mentioned. This principle is absolutely inadmissible as applied to the Chambers of Commerce in America.",
                "It would mean that Italians in foreign countries, in which they reside would also be subject to Italian Legislation.",
                "As we have previously stated the majority of our members have acquired naturalization papers. In stating this fact, we do not feel compelled to make excuses or give reasons for it. Anyone who has not lived in this country might find it difficult to understand them and besides these reasons have been thoroughly explained in two letters, one written by the New York Italian Chamber of Commerce to the Minister of Commerce, and the other written by Chicago Chamber to Geneva.",
                "If American citizenship gives the foreigner certain advantages, it also entails definite responsibilities, which he cannot ignore. The first of these is to renounce allegiance to foreign potentates. To fail in that promise would be to fail in maintaining the franchise of the vote, so generously given by our adopted country. The Chicago Chamber is an organization operating under the laws of Illinois, and to preserve complete autonomy and independence it must continue to do so. For us to be neglectful of our duty to this country by operating under the laws of Italy, as well as the laws of Illinois, would harm the position of this Chamber and of the many Italian communities throughout America.",
                "One of the results of the rebellion of the American mind against the insidious German propaganda that filtered into this country, was to make it overwhelmingly jealous of the freedom of this nation from foreign interference of any kind.",
                "To that sentiment can be attributed the severe laws that have been proposed by many and which in some states have already been adopted. Restrictions on immigration, newspaper printed in foreign languages, teaching of foreign languages in the schools and their use in public assemblies are some of the rigid and unjust measures advocated which we, not collectively, but as individual American citizens propose to fight. Under these circumstances it is easy to understand what impression would be formed of an organization which operated according to laws issued by a foreign government, and the antipathy which would be inspired not only against the members of such an organization, but also those of the same race.",
                "We wish to say, however, that in changing our nationality we have not discarded that affection which we proudly feel for Italy. We can point with pride to the accomplishments of this Chamber, not only in the field of commerce, but also in promoting the sale of Italian bonds in this country.",
                "Our Chamber joined the American Red Cross as a patron member because of the good that that organization has done for Italy, and a Red Cross Committee composed of members chosen from the Executive Council has solicited considerable sums from members of this Chamber and Italians in Chicago.",
                "A number of our members have fought the insidious Jugo-Slavian propaganda against Italian rights on Fiume in the columns of American newspapers, and we for the same reason with funds solicited among our members, have published pamphlets, convoked meetings, formed committees and entertained missions from Italy. We have promoted a petition among all the Italian societies in America and with its one hundred and sixty thousand (160,000) signatures, have had it presented to President Wilson by two delegates, members of this Chamber. It protested against the absurd claims of Jugo-Slavia on the Adriatic. In a word, although a majority of the members have become naturalized, true Italianism, ever trying to be useful to Italy and to render more cordial the relations between these two countries.",

If freedom of action is restrained or reduced, it would easily reduce also the numerical and constructive power of our Chamber and its usefulness.",

                "The mass-meeting called by the Club Giordano Bruno, as a protest against the deed of the Italian Consul in giving the management of the so-called lodging house to the nuns, should have taken place in the Roma Theater.",
                "But at the last moment, the proprietor, influenced by somebody who thought that in the meeting improper facts would be discussed and revealed, refused the use of the theater.",
                "We did not give up. We immediately found another place, the Dante Theater, and the mass-meeting took place just the same, in spite of the supporters of Count Bolognesi and the clericals.",
                "The mass-meeting was presided over by Mr. Eugenio Pecori a member of the Club. First in Italian, and then in English, he explained the noble purpose of the mass-meeting, which was to protest against the Consul for having entrusted the management of that overcrowded \"shanty\" which is called a lodging house, to the nuns-who are using that hypocritical privilege to gain merits and to propagate their abominable Catholic doctrine.",
                "He vindicated the high mission of the Club, [and refuted] the stupid insinuations of hysterical clericals, who had so influenced Hull House against the Club, that the Club was refused the use of Rowen Hall for the commemoration of Giordano Bruno, free thinker martyr.",
                "Then Comrade T. Lucidi, official speaker of the Club, delivered a very interesting speech. He recapitulated the painful history of our immigration to America, and described the efforts exerted by consular officers, priests, and outstanding Italians, for the welfare of the suffering mass, in contract to the efforts of those who are assuming airs of benefactors when they really are mystifiers, liars and leeches of humanity. He praised the high mission of the Club, which mission is that of illuminating the darkness, which has been imposed on humanity by sacred dogma, with the torch of truth. He attacked the Italian Consul, who, availing himself of the fund which the Italian government put at his disposal for the welfare of the needy, used it to make propaganda for the priests and nuns. They-in turn-with the excuse of charity, conspire against the intellectual and economic redemption of the working people, whom they try to hold down as slaves of religious superstitions and the present politico-economic system.",
                "Mr. E. Gradinetti then addressed the meeting, in the name of the Socialists of Chicago. He deplored the acts of Consul Bolognesi and condemned the wretchedness of such acts. Talking about the Consular's office, he described it not as an office for protection and aid, but as an agency of international espionage.",
                "At the end, one of the inmates of the famous lodging house described, in a few words, the place where the indigents are suffering from starvation, cold, and the abuses of the \"good Sisters.\" He said that the ten inmates who came to our office to protest against the treatment received at the lodging house were thrown out of [the shelter] by policemen.",
                "It was resolved to draw up a petition and send it as a protest, with a telegram, to the Secretary of Foreign Affairs in Rome.",
                "As a consequence of the mass-meeting, we were informed that in the lodging house certain acts of coercion were used against the inmates who had the courage to protest; and a few, who refused to submit themselves to shameful impositions, were, as was said at the meeting, thrown out of the lodging house by the police.",
                "\"Worthy of praise\" is the imperative admonition of a well known doctor, a satellite of Consul Bolognesi. He said, to the protesting immates: \"If you do not like to stay here, get out!\" And yet they do not ask for too much, dear doctor. They, in suffering the humiliation of charity, wish, at least, that their stomachs be filled, so that their liberty of conscience should be respected and not be gagged-as in the times of the Holy Inquisition-every time they feel inclined to make a just protest or to reveal the truth.",
                "Go ahead, then, Mr. Consul, priests, nuns, and self styled benefactors! You show that you are afraid of those who have the courage to openly criticize your acts. We take advantage of your fright, and we will continue to reveal to the public your outrages and scandalous acts."

And now, after an accomplished deed, he announces in the newspapers that starving Italians may have, from now on, a bowl of soup-thanks to consular-monastic charity.",
                "How can Mr. Bolognesi say that no other way was open to him? Was it not an insult to the other existing beneficent institutions of our colony that he completely ignored them? But he has clerical sympathies and so he chose the only way possible.",
                "Our clever Consul is perfectly free to be clerical as long as he wishes; but the most independent and intelligent Italians of Chicago will not overlook that provocation, and will oppose such policies with an energetic anti-clerical movement.",

                "We stand for the principle of the thing, but we rightfully maintain that it is time for the representative of Italy to stop using the money of the Italian government to give help to the Catholic Church, the defrauder of our colonies.",
                "The time has arrived for anti-clerical Italians to arouse themselves, organize and fight.",
                "The impurity of the Catholic influx to this country is becoming more insufferable and repugnant. Its everlasting insincerity is that it operates not for the good but for the purpose of extending its pestilential influence.",
                "As an example, consider the activities here in America of the Catholic Church in establishing grammar schools in opposition to the [secular] public schools. It is certainly admirable to teach children; however, the priests perform that task not for the good of it, but as a chance for propaganda. And this our priests, in their Italo-American schools, are anti-Italians for the original sin, and anti-Americans for their daily acts.",

Was that the teaching of Christ?",

                "These events are of such importance that they cannot be overlooked; as you know, the public should know the truth and should not be deceived as was the case when the Italian newspapers of Chicago, without knowledge of the real facts, filled various columns with incorrect statements, foolishness, and lies.",
                "Two or three weeks ago, the American newspapers made much ado over the news that the Italian Government, through its representative, Count G. Bolognesi, had rented a four-story building and furnished it with thirty beds, so that the poor people of our colony who are without any resources, could be sheltered and fed.",
                "We are not interested in the American press, but we would like to talk about the Italian newspapers. Do you think, Mr. Consul, that they are interested in protecting our honor and dignity? Certainly not. If they were, they would not say so much about the Lodging House.",
                "Why don't the newspapermen personally investigate the facts before writing their long articles? In expressing their own opinions to the public it is necessary that they be well informed, and aware of what they want to publish; we are sure that if they had followed our advice, they would not have printed so many lies, lies which are damaging our colony.",
                "Since it appears that we are lacking in honest newspapermen, I will assume the task and will try to do my best. Aroused by the curiosity to see the celebrated Lodging House established by the Italian Government through its representative in this city, last Friday I went in search of that welfare institution; but I could not find it-because it was not located on the street announced by the newspapers. The next day, Saturday, I finally found it-not on Little Street-but at 802 Centre Avenue-now Racine Avenue-.",
                "It is not a four-story but a three-story building, and not all three floors are occupied by our indigent countrymen: the second and third floors are rented to private families. Thus only one floor, the first, is used for lodging. On this floor were crowded about fifty persons. It was about 10 A. M. when I arrived, and soup was being served. Every one was seated. Two or three were acting as waiters.",
                "A gentleman, a representative of Count Bolognesi, maintained order. At his request, I informed him that I was an Italian interested in seeing the place, I remained until the end of the meal. Thus I had the opportunity of seeing the quality of the soup that was served. The soup looked like dish water and it contained only a few pieces of broken macaroni of inferior quality. Four or five (wafer-thin) slices of bread completed the meal. Meals are served twice a day: at 10:30 A. M., and at 4:30 P. M. There is an interval of about nineteen (sic) hours between supper and the morning meal of the next day.",
                "I asked about the beds, and the representative of Count Bolognesi replied that the beds were not ready yet; but he could not tell me the reason. I thought: Perhaps the beds were ordered from a high-grade factory which specializes in high-grade beds, the only kind appropriate for a government shelter.",
                "The space used as a dormitory is not adequate for the needs, unless they consider the floor as a mattress and the roof as a blanket.",
                "Poor unfortunates! For two weeks they have lived this life. And all the newspapers are boasting to the public about the wonderful \"Lodging House.\" And do you know why, most illustrious Count? Because you had the wonderful idea of availing yourself of your contact with the clerical gang.",
                "And before I ask you a few questions I would like to advise the readers and newspapermen of Chicago that they will accomplish a good deed if they will personally investigate [the conditions in the Shelter]. They will verify my contention that it is only a scheme to gain money to fatten those Sisters of the Sacred Heart.",
                "However, the press said that this Lodging House-not yet operating, incidentally-was financed by the Italian Government (with money collected from unfortunate Italian people); but to-day, subscription lists are being circulated among the Italians for that purpose.",
                "Why do they not make themselves clear? Whose is the responsibility of supporting the Shelter, the Government's, or the colony's? If it is the colony's duty, [we ask,] how many welfare institutions must it support? Do you not think it time to stop such schemes? The colony is financially exhausted already. Who must take care of the shelter, the Italian Women's Society, or the Sisters of the Sacred Heart?",
                "We do not understand any thing any more. Too much confusion. And all this makes matters worse for the unfortunates in need, and ignorant people, who bite the bait only because some self-styled \"Big Shot\" makes a financial donation-not for any altruistic sentiment he might have-but only to make himself [favorably] conspicuous.",
                "You ask for proof? You want to know who these patriotic \"Big Shots\" are? Anything they have done or are doing, they do to help the priests and nuns, not to help the poor people.",
                "Ask those \"Big Shots,\" if they ever gave any help to Hull House! And yet this institution has done much more good than all the priests and nuns.",
                "Nine year ago, an Evangelical Mission was on Clark St., and Marquis Petacci was the pastor. During the winter, more than one hundred needy were sheltered and fed there. But the press and the self-styled conspicous people did not pay any attention to that.",
                "At the Evangelic Church on Polk and Sholto Street, I had the opportunity to notice that the pastor, Mr. Petacci, did not forget to help the poor Italians in need with milk, clothing, shoes, etc. But not one of the \"Big-Shots\" paid any tribute to Mr. Petacci. Do you understand, Count Bolognesi?",
                "But when your dear friend Father Gambara is doing a very small deed, you hear much \"toad-croaking,\" and the Royal Consul works hard to bestow upon Father Gambara the Cross of the Crown of Italy.",
                "In concluding, I beg the Italians of Chicago to co-operate with me, financially and morally, in offering a floral tribute of garlic and onions to our illustrious Count, as a token of our gratitude to the \"greatest benefactor\" of the Italians of Chicago.",

To you, therefore, falls the responsibility of reviving this useful organization, not only because it is Italian, but because it was initiated by your superior, our Ambassador to Washington.",
                "As you can see for yourself, the Society is losing ground every day. You are aware of the fiasco which resulted from this year's dance given in the Auditorium Hotel's most aristocratic ballroom. Despite the most extensive newspaper publicity carried on for two months up to the date of the dance; despite the arduous work of the committee, composed of the most prominent women in the colony, it was a veritable fiasco. Of one hundred and twenty-five thousand Italians in Chicago, only two hundred and fifty attended and that number included the members and their families. So, actually, only about one hundred outsiders attended.",
                "Nevertheless, the newspaper L'Italia boldly reported that the attendance reached the five hundred mark and that it was a great success, of which the colony could well be proud.",
                "One should, it is true, encourage beneficent institutions, but they must be institutions with a serious program, and led by capable persons. In our colony, especially among the women, that element is missing. We have good mothers, good housekeepers, but for administering a society, we have no one. The newspaper L'Italia is fully aware of this, but dares not mention it -- for fear, perhaps -- of losing subscribers.",
                "Therefore, Mr. Consul, if you do not wish to see this Society disappear, do as I advise, without considering the fact that the advice comes from the [minority] in our colony. I advise you to enter as a member, to bring in with you others of good will, and to try to persuade the brave women that the best thing for the organization is to ally itself with an American Charitable organization -- for in doing that -- it would be acting for its own good."

Certainly you must have been satisfied, although not as satisfied as you would have been had the results been in accordance with the wishes of the Tribuna Transatlantica. Unfortunately it did not go that way, and even I am content. Nevertheless, I would have liked it otherwise to a certain extent. For instance, I wish that brave exiled rebel, Amilcar Cipriani, had been elected from Pissolati. That would have been a slap in the face to King Victor Emmanuel - who exiled him.",

                "I think I can give a practical example of the benefits which the Italian people have derived from the Savoy Government. On a railroad construction job in Illinois, three hundred Italians were employed. On payday they met at an appointed place and as each received his pay he signed his name on the register. Of the three hundred, only one, to the honor and glory of the Italian Government, could sign his name. Then the paymaster, in admiration of this one phenomenal worker, gave him a cigar. The others filled the register with crosses, until it looked liked a graveyard filled with crosses of the House of Savoy.",
                "Speaking of the civilization of the Arabs, I have this to tell you. A few years ago, 742 Forquer St. was occupied by a saloon, the owner of which was Mr. Barase, a scoundrel with a false reputation for honesty and president of a number of societies. When I had occasion to pass by this place, I saw persons of both sexes enter; the women, for the most part, were old. I could not conceive what business might cause them to frequent such a place. One day my curosity got the best of me. I decided to enter and investigate for myself. I saw that these persons, instead of stopping at the bar, walked to the back - room. I presumed that someone was ill, and considering the reputation of that personage, Mr. Barase, decided that the sick person must be of his family. I asked him who was sick, but he, removing his hat, answered, \"No one is sick, thank God; there is a statue of San Donato there and these people come here to say their prayers before it, since he is one of the most miraculous saints.\" I asked for permission to view the saint, and Mr. Barase graciously consented, so I entered. The room has been transformed into a chapel. A statue, weighing close to a half-ton, was placed on a table. At each side of the statue stood an unlighted candelabra. The only light was from an oil lamp set in a glass. Before the statue stood a spitoon not for the Saint's use, but to receive the alms of the faithful.",
                "For kneeling benches, two old macaroni boxes were being used. But what was more interesting was to see a screen which was set up to cover the statue. This screen or curtain, perhaps to give a sample of Italian and Catholic cleanliness, was a bed sheet, which from all appearances had not been washed for two months preyious to being removed from the bed. It had red and green spots, and had it not been for the grime it could have been used for an Italian flag.",
                "Since then, the location of the statue has been changed. It can now be found in the Bacigalupo Undertaking Parlors, at 753 Forquer St.",

Yet there are three public schools named after three Irish saloon-keepers. Letters of protest sent by Italians to the president of the Board were read by the secretary, but they were not enough to change the attitude of the Board. We are pleased to say that not one Italian wrote protesting against the name of Garibaldi. Therefore, the statement made by Mrs. O'Keefe and the other Irishmen, who are on the school-naming committee, that our countrymen seriously objected to the name of Garibaldi being given to the old school on W. Polk street, is no more than a lie.",

The Reverend Father Dunne, in his letter to the New World, which we translated into Italian, stated, \"We prefer the devil rather than Garibaldi.\"",

Then at the Board meeting, they decided to have the name of President Polk. At first nearly all of the members were duly interviewed, and a memorandum was given everyone present at the meeting, on which was written every reason why the school should be named after Garibaldi.",

Through the efforts of the new members of the Board of Education, who will be appointed within the next fifteen days by Mayor Harrison, the victory can change into defeat.

The mission was moved westward to 1206 W. Taylor Street in 1919, and became the Garibaldi Institute, one of the most well-known neighborhood houses in the city.",
                "A Story of St. John Presbyterian Institutional Church. (Pamphlet).",
                "Here a group of Italian men and women organized the St. John Presbyterian Church, buying the present building in 1930 with the aid of the Church Extension Board of the Chicago Presbytery.",
                "Members of St. John have said of the Rev. Pasquale De Carlo, \"As a man of conviction, sincerity, earnestness and consecration, he is a true friend to his little children; he has saved boys from becoming criminals; he has influenced, encouraged, and aided young people to obtain a better education; he has brought peace to many a father and mother through his counsel; and he strives to interpret Christ continuously to all people of all ages.\"",
                "The growth and service of this church has been a story of the personality and service of its minister, a religious leader of marked practical philosophy and business acumen, a man of literary training and experience who has been editor of two Italian-American newspapers and a magazine.",
                "For twelve years a field representative of the Church Extension Board of the Chicago Presbytery, and now acting as Superintendent of Garibaldi Institute, as well as minister of St. John Church and the director of its manifold program, this elderly man has won the homage of his people and the respect of business men and denominational leaders.",
                "SOME GLIMPSES OF LIFE AND WORK AT ST. JOHN.",
                "Visit with the writer several typical programs at St. John Institutional Church. Throughout the week-day activities, a religious emphasis is the center of all group and personal work of the church staff, and reaches its culmination in the impressive Protestant services in the auditorium, each Sunday morning.",
                "But there is more than a Sunday schedule in this building. Every one present on Sunday is actively engaged in thirty or forty week-day programs.",
                "FOR THE FAMILY",
                "In its Family Department, the church interprets the needs and difficulties of hundreds of families in the community to the various relief organizations, securing contacts with clinics, dispensaries, and hospitals, visiting in countless homes each month, and maintaining friendly contacts throughout the community.",
                "Throughout the week the many organizations meeting in the church include a Junior and Intermediate Choir, a Junior High Choir, a Young People's Choir, as well as music classes and a music library, all provided for Italian young people, who have little opportunity or resources to pursue their musical interests.",
                "Moving from room to room of the church building on any week-day, we see many other practical activities sponsored by this realistic church and its very shrewd Minister, who understands so well the importance of a constructive use of leisure time. It is through these group activities that this church strives to teach the attributes of Christian character and the ways in which boys and girls, men and women, must live and work together.",
                "FOR BOYS AND GIRLS.",
                "There are clubs for boys and girls, sewing classes, Camp Fire Girls Scouts; Boy Scouts, music appreciation classes, home economics, manual training groups, carving classes, and other types of activity included in this church's institutional program for its children.",
                "FOR YOUNG PEOPLE",
                "The nature and quality of many young people's discussion groups, and the significant, serious problems which these Italian young people are considering under the educational leadership of staff members at St. John Church, are revealed in a striking way by a list of topics recently used in a series of discussion meetings of one of these groups:",
                "\"The Advancement of Medicine\"; \"Vocational Guidance - the Choosing of a Profession\"; \"Child Psychology - the Care and Training of Children\"; \"Problems of Youth - Youth Administration Groups\"; \"Music - Its History and Background\"; \"The Care of the Body\"; \"World Peace\"; \"Real Causes of War\"; and many others of a similar scope and importance to young people of today.",
                "FOR THE ITALIAN PARENTS.",
                "Adult men and women have found help at St. John in many ways. For many, life has been difficult in America. The only bright spot in the life of numerous Italian women is the \"Women's League\" meeting, once a week, in the Protestant church, where they make friends, sew, and learn many things by this contact with the outside world.",
                "Still another phase of this institution's program suggests to us that no better opportunity is offered on Chicago's West Side for the development of patriotic and loyal Americans, than through the Christian program and teachings of this church. For the parents there are classes in English and citizenship, helping to bridge language barriers and to foster Christian attitudes. Again, there are classes in Italian for young people, in order that there may be better understanding between the first and second generation of these families.",
                "It is the hope of St. John Church that its activities will facilitate, rather than prevent, the cultural transition of these people by aiding parent and youngster to join in becoming citizens of America.",
                "For, the church must interpret not only one generation to another, but must interpret America to its new citizens,presenting the best of American culture, and, at the same time, interpret the new citizens to America, conserving the finest elements of the alien culture brought to our shores.",
                "As I have come to know these things at St. John, I have begun to see the way in which young and old are welcomed into the friendly atmosphere of this building, so that entire families are served and aided. It is impossible to guess the significance, extent and depth, of such service as this.",
                "PLAY AND STUDY FOR SUMMER DAYS",
                "If our visit to the church of the great, tall spire at Harrison Street and Hoyne Avenue is during the Summer weeks, we will see one of the most impressive manifestations of the program for boys and girls, as we observe sessions of a vacation church school, that draws two hundred and fifty children for a daily program of Summer supervised play and instruction.",
                "This church school has welcomed everybody. It has taught children to adopt responsibilities, it has offered encouragement and opportunity for creative expression when such encouragement means most in the life of a youngster.",
                "It is by such effort as this that young people growing up in areas of undesirable influences, in the great neighborhoods of Chicago that breed criminals, are kept from becoming misfits in the social scheme of things.",
                "CITY.....COUNTRY...FAMILY...AND CHURCH.",
                "With our visit to these manifold activities completed, we return once more to the office of the Rev. De Carlo, who directs this detailed program, and yet finds time for many personal interviews and to advise many individuals in their problems. From our conversation with this seventy-two year old Minister, who still retains the energies and capacities of far younger men, we catch a new conception of the goals of St. John Presbyterian Institutional Church.",
                "Inseparably linked to these goals are the conceptions of the family, the city, the country and the church. Upon the family structure rest the institution of citizenship and the welfare of a nation, this Minister fervently believes it is the Christian church that can do most to preserve families in the midst of distracting and disturbing urban influences.",
                "So it is that at St. John, there is this varied schedule of daily activities designed to enrich the lives of families surrounding the church, making the church building a center for the educational interests of several hundred each week, a center for physical training and development, a center for the building of citizenship, a place for the worship of God and the strengthening of human character. To such a series of activities an attendance of sixty-eight thousand (68,000) persons was recorded last year. Of this figure hundreds were little children, while many others were parents and grandparents.",
                "BUILDING LEADERSHIP",
                "The fostering of family ties, by means of a ministry designed for every member of the family, is but one goal at St. John. Still another envisages the finding and training of individual leaders in this community that is so rich with potential leadership, if these characteristics and abilities are properly directed and guided. Every master criminal of Chicago's history, every sensational figure in its under-world who has come from its foreign speaking neighborhoods, has had the potentialities of a great leader; traits that were twisted until these qualities of leadership were used for law-breaking and destructive purposes.",
                "To build social leaders, Christian leaders, from the youth of a West Side community, is one of the things that St. John Church strives to do. No institution like it has so truly managed and expertly aimed at this goal. Few churches have adapted the philosophy of Jesus Christ to so practical an application in so useful a week-day program."

He has been in Germany at different times and has had the opportunity to excel in German music. After coming to America, he became the director of the Ellery Band, attaining great success. He is only 29 years old, and is the youngest director in America. He loves Italian music, because he is Italian, but he also fervently admires the German music. His band occupies first place among the great bands and, for that reason, will return to Ravinia Park, this year, where he will retake the stand for the New York Symphony orchestra, which takes the place of Thomas' orchestra from Chicago. The band is composed of fifty players elected from among the best in America. In place of the soloists we find last year's orchestra members are the same.",

                "From Greek rule to Bourbon tyranny, Sicily has been an oppressed state. Its richly producing land giving untold wealth in grain, olives and sulphur, has for centuries attracted the ruling monarchs of Europe, and the most powerful came to dictate. Even the Arab had his say and today one finds slight traces of the Arabic language in the dialect spoken on the western coast of Sicily.",
                "While nations amassed power and wealth, the state of Sicily was continually ravaged and sapped of its resources and produce by foreign lords. The people were kept in a state of ignorance and servitude, the higher class forcing them to remain submissive to the dictating governors.",
                "The peasants knew nothing but work and more work, slaving from sunrise to sunset, often working long into the night, so that at the end of the harvest there would be a few bushels of wheat left over for them. The Bourbons could not resist the tempting resources of Sicily, so after conquering the rulers they began their tyrannical reign. At this time the kingdom of the two Sicilys was proclaimed. From Naples to the Strait of Messina was one Sicily, the other was the state itself. What other nations had failed to get from these states the Bourbon did not. The new lords not satisfied with the taxes from the suffering peasants resorted to killing, stealing, and torturing. Their harsh methods becoming violent, the people were reduced to a level lower than that of the English serf. This state of affairs continued until one man, tired of the barbarism of the controlling foreigners, arose in arms with a thousand Garibaldini and began his famous march through Sicily and southern Italy, until the country became free. This man, called Garibaldi, defied everyone, even the most powerful of all rulers, the Pope, seizing the Roman state with the newly baptized platoon of La Marmora, called the Bersaglieri.",
                "Sicily, whose rich soil is bathed by the waters of the historic Mediterranean, whose youth has died gallantly upon many a battlefield at the righteous command of its ruler, is today again oppressed by the so-called writers, who fail to understand the deep thoughts and character of men. Yesterday it was oppression for the amassing of wealth; today, moral oppression by a few.",
                "Within the city there are men who either do not know history or wish to create a history of their own. Throughout their writings they rank Sicily and its inhabitants as a nation, as a people in itself, having no connection whatever with the peninsula. This is not so. Still the assertion has been made many times, and for the sake of a few amateur editors it can be said openly that no part of Italy is more loyal than Sicily.",
                "In the Nov. 22, 1928, issue of the Chicago Tribune there was an editorial entitled \"For an American Policy.\" Within the paragraphs of the editorial, between the hurriedly typed lines, one sees prejudices arising from hatred, inspired generations back, as far as the Roman Empire, when the Britons were slaves to the whips of the Caesars.",
                "The cunningness of the writer is great. First he classes the history and social conditions of Sicily with those of the Orient and southeastern countries of Europe, apologizing to the intelligent Sicilian. He goes on with his weird ideas and states that immigration should be shut down for two generations, but that if there should be any immigration it should be determined strictly by the principles of preparedness for American life; this preparedness being judged by similarity of history, race character, ethical standards, and modes of thought and feeling. In these few lines rests the ignorance of the writer.",
                "The Sicilian is judged as a bad character only by the press of the city. Why is it? Only one answer remains, the paper must fill its columns. In no other city in the country does one find so bitter a hatred against the Sicilian. Well, the papers say they are pagans, they came from the southeastern portion of Europe, and they are cattle, so let it go at that. Probably this great writer does not know that America is cosmopolitan and that it was not the English alone who built this mighty nation.",
                "Should the inhabitants of Europe be permitted to enter this country, Italy should have its quota for the Italians are builders, not destroyers, and that includes Sicilians. Let it also be known to this writer that we would like to know which country is best prepared for American life by his definition of preparedness.",
                "We know America, this great beautiful country in which the Almighty placed his greatest energies, is cosmopolitan. Its ethics, modes of feeling and thought, if torn apart and analyzed would be none other than those of the Roman, seasoned with a dash of the barbaric Teuton, and a taste of the uncouth Anglo-Saxon. Still, the children of the old Empire, the people in whose veins flows the blood of that ancient and noble civilization are classed with the pagan Orientals by this great newspaper man.",
                "It is not a crime to say these things, no, it's just plain ignorance. They know better. However, say what they wish, Italy (which includes Sicily) has never produced a \"yellow\" person, one who wishes to destroy the high morals of another people regardless of its effect upon the man."
