                "Professor Chr. Anderson, son of the Rev. A.W.Andersen, Danish Trinity Lutheran Church of Chicago gave an excellent lecture last Friday night in his father's church. The young professor who holds a high position at Wayne University in Detroit spoke on the subject: \"A Modernization of our Educational System. \"The lecture was accompanied by moving pictures.",
                "Professor Andersen began his lecture with paying a tribute to the Trinity congregation, expressing his thanks and appreciation for the years he has lived among this little group of people, and for the ideals with which they had imbued him while growing up. He admitted that he, like most other young people did not at that time understand or appreciate the idealism which causes Danish emigrants to hold on to their spiritual values. He had learned that later and felt now clearly that this alone was an invaluable inheritance and an asset in his work as an educator.",
                "He informed us that about one third of the teachers at Wayne University were of Scandinavian descent.",
                "The lecture was clear and intelligible to all. The speaker had a pleasing way of expressing himself and met criticism with understanding.",
                "Maybe the Detroit School system is good for Detroit because Detroit is a marked industrial center; yet it must be said that this system is based on the fact that the parents in general do not possess a strong feeling of responsibility and are either too poor or too lazy to concern themselves about the education of their children. The speaker was of the opinion that sooner or later it would prove a necessity to keep the children in school to the age of twenty-one, all on account of the scarcity of jobs. The many years of schooling would not include academic education or any other thorough training, but the time would be spent in a pleasant way, as far as possible, to the individual satisfaction of the students. It seems to me that this system of education puts too much of a burden on parents who are poor. Possibly also that state and county would have to support the young folks while growing up which would be a total surrender of responsibility on the part of the parents, and which in this country would mean surrender of responsibility to the politicians. The Spartans in old Greece had a similar idea 2,600 years ago. It did not work so well. Now the same thing is tried in Italy, Germany, Russia and other places. The result is doubtful.",
                "I believe the best we could do is to take a look at Nature and notice what is going on. Living beings in general have a decided feeling of responsibility towards their offspring and will see to it the young ones are being properly educated so they can stand on their own feet in the world; but of course in the world of nature we do not find any half-baked psychologists.",

                "Forty years ago, in the year of the last World's Fair in Chicago, an extraordinary convention of the Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, assembled in Chicago, directed that its national board consider the erection of a new theological seminary. Undaunted by the panic of that year and the subsequent economic exigencies, the regular conventions of 1893 and 1894 dared to propose a large plan and adopted a resolution to erect a Danish-American university.",
                "Their hopes envisaged a plant built to accomodate two hundred students and so organized as to be able to meet the expanding needs of the synod. Its fruition required the services of three men, wrote R. R. Westergaard; one who could sing, one who could fan the flames, and a daredevil.",
                "F. L. Grundtvig, son of the Danish educator, poet, historian, and bishop, became the poet laureate of the Danish immigrants; Thorvald Helveg, graduate of the University of Copenhagen, fed and fanned the feeble flame; and P. Kjolhede, trained at Askov Folk High School in Denmark, rose as a courageous giant. These three men, endowed with the life and spirit of the three great cultural centers and movements of nineteenth-century Denmark, symbolized the hope that there might arise in America a larger school, dedicated to the task of preserving the cultural values of Danish origin and of seeking the new in their adopted land. The fourth of July, 1895, the building committee secured the title to the property in Des Moines, Iowa, on which the new university was to rise.",
                "The dreams of an imposing university structure were not realized. One section of the present plant was completed and dedicated September 27, 1896; the second was erected in 1898 to meet the needs of an expanding enrollment; and in 1904 the structure was completed. The joy manifested the day the school was dedicated was not dispelled by the fact that no students had as yet enrolled. The first student came that afternoon; he bore the illustrious Danish name, Niels Jul. Since then thousands of young Danish-Americans have attended the college.",
                "In November 1897, the school was named Grand View College. The thought of a university had not disappeared, but the character of the school changed to meet the needs of the synod and of the young people. As it grew, it expanded to include not only a seminary and a normal-training course for Danish-American teachers but also business course, a department of physical education, and a short winter session, patterned after the folk high schools. It incorporated later a High School and eventually a Junior College. Now it offers three years of seminary work, two years of college, Junior College, the last two years of High School, a teachers' training course preparatory for work in the vacation schools in Danish-American communities, a department of physical education, and business and technical courses."

                "Permit me to call your attention to an inaccuracy in A. T. Dorf's article, \"The Tennessee Case,\" which reveals a certain degree of misunderstanding.",
                "It will not do for us to distinguish between the aims and purposes of elementary education and those of higher education, or to question our right to academic freedom. If we did, we should be supporting Bryan's theory, which holds that [proper] education is what the majority says it is, whether or not it is consistent with truth and reality. Our schools and universities should be free to teach the truth, which is discovered and promulgated by scientists and experts better than by a majority of lawmakers.",
                "The Bill of Rights in our Constitution expressly exempts the individual from majority rule in certain respects, as for instance in relgion. No majority can force the individual to join a certain religious denomination. State and church are separate institutions. For that reason the foolish attempt made by the State of Tennessee to force school boards to adopt an orthodox theory of education will be declared unconstitutional when the case reaches the Supreme Court and probably before.",
                "To be sure, while religion is a subject banished from our schools, atheism should not be taught as a substitute; but we cannot keep out the theory of evolution by branding it as atheism. The biblical theory of creation has nothing to do with our educational system. Whatever facts science has discovered about the origin and development of our globe and of the living beings which inhabit it is a separate and distinct matter which should be available for study in educational institutions. The Montrey Act of Tennessee is a plain attempt to subjugate the church to state authority and have it made over according to orthodox Protestant doctrines, and this is against the Constitution of this country.",
                "Enforcement of the law would result in trouble and nonsense anyhow. In geography the children would learn about the four corners of the earth, and the sun and moon hung up to furnish us with light. In zoology they would learn that rabbits and hares belong to the class of cud-chewing animals. Physics would be mostly miracle tales, as for instance the one about cold fire and the iron that could float on water. In astronomy it would not do to tell the pupils that our earth is but an infinitesimal part of the solar system, a fact gradually revealed through the ages.",
                "No; scientific discoveries cannot be abrogated. They constitute a foundation for our civilization, and it is necessary that they shall be subjected to study in our educational institutions so that the younger generation may feel at home in its environment and adjust its attitude toward religion accordingly. The Montrey Act of Tennessee contradicts the religious views of a number of people. What would be the result if the children of liberal-minded, enlightened parents were forced to learn that the earth was created in six days, and that a great flood covered it entirely some five thousand years ago, and to accept this and the rest of the biblical legends as actual facts? Let us pray to be delivered from that evil. Fortunately our Constitution with its Bill of Rights stands as a guardian against such nefarious attempts.",

                "\"Dana College\", Blair, Nebraska, a short time ago invited its students to participate in a competition to write a treatise of or more than 1,000 words on the above question. Of the many excellent answers received, the one reprinted below was awarded first prize. It has been most kindly lent us for publication, as it is a \"Question\" with which our readers are confronted time and again.",
                "Should a Danish-American Learn Danish - and Why? (by Holger Christensen, Dana College.)",
                "There should hardly be any doubt as to whether or not Danish-American should learn Danish; if properly considered most people will agree, that it is of great importance in many fields of endeavor. In short \"that is the answer.\"",
                "Whom shall we include as Danish-Americans? The best answer to this would be: All Danish immigrants, all born of Danish parents or near ancestors.",
                "Many Danish immigrants are possibly of the opinion, that they do not need to learn Danish; that they have learned it already, and now they want to learn as much English as possible. This is altogether natural and proper. The trouble is a foreign born has difficulty in learning English to perfection, particularly so if he throws his mother-tongue overboard. Some people seem to think that it is a waste of time for a native Dane to learn Danish in America; but this is far from being the case. We can assume as a matter of course, that it is well nigh impossible to acquire a good command of another language, if we have difficulty in expressing ourselves in our native tongue, and we must also agree that there is a woeful inexpertness among our immigrants in this respect. Most of these people speak the dialect of their province, which is difficult to understand in other provinces and more so in America.",
                "If every Danish immigrant would polish up on his dialect and acquire an understandable Danish, it would be a whole lot easier to conserve our language down through generations; it would also give the parents more indluence over their children, when they use good Danish without an admixture of anything else; the children will not only lose respect for the \"Old Country\" language, but also for their parents, when these, largely on account of difficulties with the language, are misunderstood. From the above we arrive at the conclusion that the immigrant should learn Danish as well as the American born.",
                "The American born Danish-Americans are having difficulties in grasping the position of their parents, without knowing something about the conditions which have influenced them. This is best overcome by becoming familiar with the language as well as with its literature; unless one has the opportunity to travel and receive first-hand information, here again a command of the language plays an important role.",
                "Many will perhaps say; we can obtain the different country's literature in translations; this is true, but no translation from the Scandinavian or German languages into English, however good, can even approximately compare with the Original language.",
                "Others will claim there are so few opportunities to use Danish as its distribution is somewhat limited. You will find Danes wherever you go in this world and they also retain their language. We go to much trouble and many head-aches to learn the \"dead\" languages, which after our school-days are quickly forgotten.",
                "It should be the ideal of every Danish-American to know the Danish language and its characteristics. The Danish literature is so encompassing and comprehensive that no one wished to become acquainted with foreign conditions needs be without material for study. Many will say, that they are familiar with these conditions, because they have Danish parents, but here they are wrong; the Danish people and the Danish-American are two very different people both socially and in thought.",
                "The two have much to learn from one another, learning their ways of living, their horizon of life, thereby widening ones own. The same applies to the study of languages. Anyone studying a new language considers it a serious and pleasant undertaking and refrains from mixing the different languages like another \"Bable with its Confusion of Tongues.\" He will also realize that his knowledge of his own native language will materially improve as he proceeds in his study."

Immigrants often complain that although the United States is a democracy, a land of the free, and a refuge for oppressed and ill treated, they, nevertheless, have suffered at the hands of some people here, just as they suffered in the old country. There is a good deal of wrong done, and altogether too much law violation, resulting in unnecessary suffering. Why? Because the citizens of this country are not doing their duty towards democracy. There is too much ignorance, too much indifference, and too much pure laziness. Things will not, and can not be made better, until there is an improvement in the citizenship, here and elsewhere.",
                "In the first place, there are too many people here from other countries who do not know the English language. They can not function as citizens, because they do not know how. Too many do not care to take the trouble to learn how, or to make use of their opportunities to influence things for the better. It must be your wish, and the wish of every man and woman who believes in common good, to assist those who do not know the language of the land, or how to perform their duties as citizens. You naturally ask, \"What can I do?\" The answer is simple: \"Learn those duties yourself, and see to it that your nearest neighbor learns them. Unless you do this, you have no right to complain about the government.\"",

They are too blind to see that failing to do their duty well is bound to cause them a great deal of trouble eventually, and that to seek only small favors, instead of honesty and efficiency in public service, is to deprive the people of much good and many greater advantages, which come from efficient and honest administration. Again, you ask, perhaps, \"What shall I do?\" And again the answer is: \"First, do what is right yourself, and then influence others to do the same.\"",
                "Lastly, there are people who use their influence as citizens for their own personal advantage at the expense of all the people. They not only vote, but do everything in their power to make others vote for them and their friends, because they profit by it. These people often do a great harm. They are responsible in a large measure that public welfare is neglected and politics used to help the individuals or cliques who try to grab the power. If the citizens were to do their duty, it would be impossible for these people to get into power. Individuals would be elected who would do right, and whose goal is the public good, your good. Are you asking again, \"what can I do?\" You can use your vote against dishonesty, and vote for the honest, public-spirited man. You can influence others around you to do the same. You can be on guard always. One alert man, who does his duty like this, is worth a hundred of the indifferent. You can realize of what great value you can be to the cause of democracy by acting upon these simple suggestions.",
                "Is it worth the effort? When you consider that your happiness, that of your family and your friends, and what is still more important, the safety and preservation of democracy, depend on your doing this, it is worth your while. Do you realize how much depends on you? Begin Today to Learn to Be An Intelligent Citizen; To Be An Active Citizen, and last, but not least, To Be A Courageous Citizen."

                "My friends and foes in the Danish settlement know I have had many a tussle with old Dr. Max, but we were never bitter enemies; we just could not agree upon the same plan of procedure in the committees where we served.

                "The many movements afoot to induce Congress to amend the Volstead Act in such a way that either beer alone or beer and wine should be allowed as non-intoxicating, will, in my opinion not bring the desired result. Most of the promoters evidently are not in possession of that knowledge which is necessary in submitting propositions for changing the Volstead Act or they have been misinformed when looking for the real facts.",
                "The Eighteenth Amendment states that, from the 16th of January, 1920, \"the manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors within, the importation thereof into, or the exporting thereof from the United States and all territories subject to the jurisdiction thereof for beverage purposes is hereby prohibited.\"",
                "The National Prohibition Act (the Volstead Act), passed to enforce the Eighteenth Amendment, states that all beverages containing one-half of one per cent or more of alcohol by volume are intoxicants.",
                "It is important to note that neither the Eighteenth Amendment nor the Volstead Act defines beer, wine, distilled liquor, etc., hence they should not be mentioned either in any petition to Congress for changing this paragraph.",
                "If Congress should pass an Amendment permitting the legal manufacture of beverages containing up to three per cent of alcohol by weight, then beverages such as beer, wine, etc., can be produced, provided they do not contain more than three per cent of alcohol by weight.",
                "There exists in the United States no official definition of what constitutes an intoxicant or an intoxicating beverage, except the arbitrary statement in the Volstead Act that intoxicating liquor shall be construed to mean beverages which contain one-half of one per cent or more of alcohol by volume.",
                "The figure one-half of one per cent was evidently picked from an early ruling by the Revenue Department, which upon suggestion by American Brewers' chemists in 1906, stated that fermented liquors containing traces of alcohol up to 0.5 per cent by volume shall be considered alcohol-free for taxing purposes. Whether such beverages were intoxicating or not did not come under consideration.",
                "The figure 2.75 per cent, which from time to time has been mentioned as the alcoholic limit for non-intoxicating beers, was very likely taken from Scandinavian revenue regulations. In these countries prior to the war, all beers were tax free if they contained less than 2.75 per cent of alcohol by volume equivalent to 2.18 per cent by weight. Beers with more than that amount of alcohol were taxed.",
                "In this connection I want to mention that the members of the Danish Temperance Society took a pledge not to drink any intoxicating beverages, and an intoxicating beverage is defined as one containing more than 2.18 per cent of alcohol by weight.",
                "Tests made in various countries show that beers with about three per cent of alcohol by weight could not be considered intoxicants, and it is my firm belief that if today a committee consisting of representatives of the American Medical Association and the American Chemical Society should propose a standard, it would set the limit of alcohol by weight at three per cent.",
                "In May, 1919, Mr. William D. Guthrie, in the Federal Court of New York City, proposed the following definition: \"Intoxicating liquors are those which are intended for use or capable of being used as a beverage and which contains alcohol in such proportion or per cent that, when consumed in quantity which will practically be drunk by an ordinary man, or in any quantity which the human stomach will ordinarily hold, will produce a condition known as intoxication or drunkenness. Drunkenness or intoxication is an abnormal mental or physical condition manifesting itself in the loss of ordinary control of the natural faculties or of bodily functions to an appreciable or material extent.\"",
                "Under this very clear definition, a beverage containing about three per cent of alcohol by weight can not be considered intoxicating.",
                "The government has established a difference between a non-intoxicating beverage and non-intoxicating in fact. This is hard to understand for the average mind.",
                "The Volstead Act clearly states that all beverages containing 0.5 per cent of alcohol by volume or more are intoxicating liquors. Section 29 of the Act states that the penalties in this Act shall not apply to a person manufacturing non-intoxicating cider and fruit juices used exclusively for home use.",
                "Mr. Woodcock, the Prohibition Director, tried to give an explanation in this testimony before the Appropriations Committee last December as follows: \"I tried the Hill Case (Congressman Hill permitted nature to produce a twelve per cent wine in his home), and the court decreed that non-intoxicating means 'non-intoxicating in fact.' If a person made wine, cider or other fermented fruit juices for exclusive use in his home, the burden was upon the government to prove that they were intoxicating in fact.\"",
                "On the other hand, the United States Department of Agriculture in its regulatory announcement of August, 1930, gives the following definition:",
                "\"1. Fruit juice is the clean, unfermented liquid obtained from the first pressing of sound, ripe, fresh fruit, or its pulp, and conforms in name to the fruit from which it is obtained.",
                "\"2. Grape juice is the clean, unfermented juice of sound, ripe grapes. It is obtained by a single pressing of the fruit, with or without the aid of heat, and with or without the removal of insoluble matter.\"",
                "Hence, if a fruit juice has undergone the slightest fermentation it is no longer fruit juice.",
                "This shows clearly to what extent the Government has to go in order to explain the inexplicable. To me a non-intoxicant, and a non-intoxicant in fact, are identical.",
                "To every unbiased mind it is clear that Congress made a fatal error in arbitrarily setting the alcohol limit at 0.5 per cent by volume. It should be brought home forcibly at the next session of Congress that it is the duty of Congress to correct this error by changing the figure 0.5 per cent of alcohol by volume to three per cent by weight, which would be in accordance with scientific opinion. This can be done without violating the Eighteenth Amendment or interfering with the balance of the Volstead Act. The American Congress should be anxious to correct a serious mistake, as long as its attention is called to it.",
                "The paragraph which should take the place of the old definition of an intoxicant would read: \"Under this Act all beverages containing three per cent of alcohol by weight or more are intoxicants.\"",
                "If the amendment is carried, it simply means that all beverages containing less than three per cent of alcohol by weight are soft drinks, hence can be sold in all places where soft drinks now are offered for sale, such as restaurants, cafes, grocery stores, drug stores, etc. No saloons will be brought into existence in this way; on the contrary, many speak-easys will close."

This is out of the question. It was decided, however, to buy a bar permit at $2.50 for every evening the bar is open. But liquor is not sold only at the bar; the janitor of Dania also sells liquor in the different club rooms. A committee was formed consisting of: Chas. Ryberg, M. Houlberg and Chas. Wilde. This committee is to see what can be done when the renting of the bar expires on April 1st, 1904. Most of the members are in favor of the idea that Dania take over the bar and get a license for the entire building."

It was the most vicious and tyrannical piece of legislation\n    enacted anywhere in the world.",

                "To every unbiased mind, it is clear that Congress made a fatal error in arbitrarily setting\n    the alcohol limit at 0.5 per cent by volume. It should be brought home forcibly at the next\n    session of Congress, that it is the duty of Congress to\n    correct this error by changing the figure 0.5 per cent of alcohol by volume to three per cent by\n    weight, which would be in accordance with scientific opinion. This can be done without violating\n    the Eighteenth Amendment, or interfering with the balance of the Volstead Act.",

Or what about the opinion of the Sewer Diggers Protective Association? Why should\n    the chemical men be regulated by their ideas of habit and taste as to alcoholic contents of one\n    thing or another?",

Amendment? Or the Volstead Act? Does Dr. Max really believe\n    it is the function of Government to regulate the habits and appetites of the people rather than\n    provide them with jobs, so that they may produce commodities in the form of food, clothing,\n    shelter, etc., and enjoy the use of them? Or is the whole thing a meaningless attempt to keep it\n    before the public's eye?",
                "I know figures are tiresome reading, but it is well to keep in mind that fifteen hundred\n    citizens and snoopers have been killed in the prohibition warfare and a great many more in gang\n    warfare. Thousands of American citizens have been killed by poisonous liquor. Over a million\n    have been indicted for violating the Volstead Act, and\n    hundreds of thousands have been jailed (some for life), and have been made criminals by\n    sumptuary law.",

                "younger generation (after 1880) also has included many citizens who have won distinction as bankers, physicians, teachers, manufacturers, and men of affairs. Three became famous as musicians and composers. At least two were members of the State legislature. Several served in the city and village governments.",
                "The Danes brought to our State an innate honesty and integrity, coupled with a will to work hard for their homes, in accordance with principles which had stood the test of centuries. This tradition showed itself in the fondness of the Danish immigrant for his native ways, foods, speech, and diversions. Some notable choirs, active for a half-century or longer, still cultivate old home songs. For many years, each Danish settlement celebrated June 5, the anniversary of the Danish constitution, as a day of celebration, but in later times the tendency has been to transfer these festivals to July 4.",
                "Like other groups of foreign origin, the Danes in Illinois--as early as the sixties--began developing a literature of their own, founded on American impressions of life and nature, or embodying old memories. Poetry flourished in the earlier Danish-American press and in a number of books. Hymns and their attendant sacred music continued to cheer and animate many men and women. From about 1880 there also developed considerable dramatic activity. The Danes still show an interest in sports dependent on personal initiative.",
                "The Dane is fond of arts and crafts, gymnastics, athletics, folk dances, and other constructive diversion. Danish artisans were much in demand until the advent of the machine age. Much artistic decoration of our older mansions in and about Chicago was done by Danish skill. Danish servants always were, and still are, at a premium.",
                "But the greatest contribution of the Danish immigrants, in Illinois and elsewhere, lies in their genius for homebuilding and the development of sound units of farming. Acting under the time-honored demand that every farm should be left in a better state of cultivation than when it was received, the Danish farmer has set a praiseworthy example for all time. Wherever a large and commodious barn is found in conjunction with a modest dwelling, it is a safe guess that a Dane was responsible.",
                "A grandson of one of the early Danish pastors in Illinois was chosen for the distinguished task of editing the great history of the United States by Henry Adams.",
                "An immigrant of the first generation is largely responsible for the initial development of our park system and many private estates.",
                "Another American of Danish birth, who came to Illinois fifty years ago, founded the only American national park in a foreign country--in Denmark--dedicated to our hospitable country of adoption."

                "The cultural problem confronting American youth of Danish descent is a momentous one. It is none less than the whole problem of developing a characteristic American culture which will be an adequate expression of American life, rooted in the best American soil and corresponding to the peculiar American environment. It must not be regarded as a superficial task, and it cannot be solved according to a general pattern. Consideration must be given to the historical background and the present conditions, and the vision of the future must reach far out beyond immediate problems.",
                "Culture is at the best a slow growth, but it is a growth. It is an expression of the life values developed by a people in its growth from a primitive economic society to a highly complex civilization. Our present American society has created an elaborate technical civilization that permits us to enjoy material life in a fashion undreamed of by our forefathers. But we must learn to distinguish between this more or less mechanical development which forms the framework of our life, and the personal and group values which fill out the framework and give life significance. The group values thus developed we call the culture of a people. Cultures differ according to environment and history. Even as the nature and temperament of a group is shaped by its struggle and development, so the culture developed by this group will be peculiar and characteristic. And if a people rises to the emergency and fills out each technical advance with corresponding life values, then an adequate culture is developed.",
                "Culture is often considered only as the expression in behaviour and accomplishment which is highest and finest. If this be true then we could hardly speak of a culture for the average man in a group. But it is not correct. Art and literature are, of course, the greatest expression of cultural values created by man's spirit and ingenuity, but culture encompasses all the expressions of man's life that rise above the base and the mechanical. Culture is a complete expression and can be found quite as fully in a less educated group as in a more select circle. The fulness of a culture is dependent upon the capacity of the group whose life it expresses.",
                "When a growth takes place in plant life, two processes will be found. Nourishment is drawn from the soil and the air, and the plant is shaped and developed according to the conditions with which it meets. In this fashion we must also regard cultural growth. Nourishment is drawn from the soil of history and tradition and from the air of present life. And the peculiar characteristics are developed in the contact with modern material and spiritual problems. We must not forget, however, that in plant life a seed of definite nature must be placed in the soil. Similarly, unless we go to the first primitive society, we will find individuals and groups with distinct traits at the very outset of cultural development. This is especially true in our American society.",
                "We of Danish origin cannot hope and should not attempt to live and develop as do the Danes in Denmark. We have as individuals and groups definitely given up the Danish environment and have willfully chosen the American. We must, therefore, banish all hope to be identical with our relatives abroad and must choose the path that will give us the best and the richest cultural future. We must plan for a future that is not in isolation from American life and culture but is in direct and intimate contact therewith. We must develop in such a way that we will carry on the heritage we have been given and make the best elements of it a vital factor in our lives. But we must not forget to shape our heritage so that it corresponds to our environment and may have survival value.",
                "My hope is that American youth of Danish descent will be aware of the opportunity it has been given and the responsibility it carries. My hope is that it will realize the importance of contributing not only material values of economic and scientific importance, and that it will live a life filled with spiritual values that may enrich it and contribute to the good of the American people.",
                "In order to do this it is necessary for us to become a vital part of growing America. We must realize the continuity of the spirit possessed by the first builders of our country, and our present life. We cannot give up the ideals for which they strove. We must work to realize the ambition of giving each and every man the opportunity to shape his own destiny and participate in the government of the people. Of course, we realize today that this will have to be done in a different fashion than that employed in the ruthless exploitation of the pre-depression age; but we must, nevertheless, seek the same goal as the men who first set foot on our Eastern shores and those who drew the first furrow in the Middle West. We should be at all times consciously and actively American. We should draw nourishment from the soil of American history and tradition and be firmly rooted in American life.",
                "But we also have to remember that as the seed contains potentially the structure of the plant, so do we inherit from the life of our forefathers our own characteristic structural make-up. Generation after generation of Danish people has struggled to develop good and surviving values that we cannot give up without stunting growth and retarding development. We are as individuals and as a group the result of ages of work and thought, and we must strive to maintain the advantage we thus culturally have given.",
                "There are values here that go even deeper than the expression found in the Danish language, which we can only hope to maintain as a group expression for a few generations. Let us, therefore, not despair that with a disappearing language all cultural values will disappear, but let us also realize that the continued maintenance of that language will enrich our lives and strengthen our culture even as Americans. Those who immediately gave up their mother tongue have betrayed the country they hoped to help.",
                "Danish culture has found expression in many ways. It is expressed in song and literature. It has found outward form in institutions and group characteristics. It has given us an educational ideal and method that is unsurpassed. It has developed an appreciation of physical training and a gymnastic system that we must never forget. It has fostered a spirit of co-operation and an ability to work together that we are sorely in need of in our land of individualism. It has given us a sense of humor and an appreciation of the fullness of human living that we need in the midst of our present life which strikes us on the one hand as being outward and superficial and on the other as being enclosed and puritanical. And finally it has aided in the development of a deep and characteristic church life that belongs to and gives expression to the fundamental attitudes of our lives.",
                "We cannot give this up without giving up all accumulated advantage. We would be reduced to primitive fundamentals and would thus benefit neither ourselves nor our country. And the more strongly Danish-American youth realizes this, the better an opportunity it will have for a contribution to American culture.",
                "Adherence to our Danish culture does not necessarily mean a narrow policy of isolation and should not necessarily imply it. We can live in and develop our special group values and still live fully in American life. In fact, in no other way can we as a group live fully as Americans. But we must not retain our Danish characteristics and our Danish culture undeveloped. If we did we might as well place them in a museum at once. They must be brought constantly into contact with modern American conditions. The elements having surviving value should be strengthened and developed, and the elements not having that value should not be carried as dead-weight.",
                "Therefore, we--the American youth born of Danish parents--should face the future with energy and courage. We should be aware of our opportunity to carry our Danish characteristics into a coming American culture. And we should face with hope the responsibility of carrying on this difficult task. If we give up, the work can never again be taken up. If we are lax and lazy, the future will suffer accordingly. If we have no vision and respect, we shall be limited, and the work will be unfulfilled.",
                "Let us, therefore, with vision, courage, and respect strive to build on American ideals and tradition, to perpetuate Danish survival values into our growing culture, and to have a clear vision of a life as people, culturally strong and firmly rooted in the soil of our country."

Americanization is a patriotic movement that has nothing whatsoever to do with our children learning foreign languages. If this is true, why do we not teach more foreign languages in our schools? Our colleges and universities do not teach the Danish language. It therefore, becomes our duty to teach it in our homes. Our Danish schools are few and far between, and the roads are long, so there are only a few children who reach them. We are the only nation in America which permits our children to have their own free will when it comes to learning their mother tongue. If we do not teach our children the Danish language, we will lose them for the nation and for Danish culture.",
                "It is not the children who should lead their parents away from that culture which their motherland gave them, but the parents should rear their children so that they will defend and extend this culture. This can only be done through the Danish language. Therefore, this should become an issue in every Danish home. Keep the Danish language alive."

Mr. Madsen entered the painting trade, and after three years of work and study in Copenhagen emigrated to Chicago in 1902, where he took up residence at the Danish Young People's Home. There he learned to play chess, and before long created a stir by his ability.",
                "Later he became a member of the Chicago Chess and Checker Club. On several occasions he has represented his club in tournaments and telegraphic matches with clubs in New York, Philadelphia and Boston. About his recent achievement the Chicago Daily News says in part:",
                "\"Madsen is entitled to his victory. He has played careful, steady, consistent chess all through the tournament.\"",
                "Madsen never forsakes his Danish traditions. He is a member of Danish Young Peoples Society, and has also performed as an amateur playwright. He is an admirer of George Brandes, J. P. Jacobsen, Horeys, and other Danish philosophers.",
                "In the last chess tournament he lost 12 lbs.",
                "In the latest tournament there were 16 members of the club's star players participating. Thus each person played fifteen games. Madsen lost but one. His closest follower was M. Lee, an American, who also lost one game but had one remiss in addition which counts for one half lost game.",
                "The result of the tournament has encouraged Danish chess players to make arrangements for several local tournaments.",
                "The establishment of a Danish chess club is also contemplated. Danes in Chicago are said to be better represented among chess players than any other foreign group except Germans."

                "But, in spite of these encouraging newspaper accounts, the truth is that prosperity is on the wane, and that we have not as yet reached rock bottom.",
                "All sorts of excuses are manufactured in order to justify existing conditions. The favorite reasons given are racketeering within the unions, the high cost of raw material, and the sudden reluctance on the part of the public to part with their hard-earned dollars.",
                "A few weeks ago, former President Coolidge, in one of his inspiring (?) articles, suggested, as a panacea, that people buy more freely in order to stimulate big business and thus swing the pendulum back to prosperity. This remedy might be effective in places where money is plentiful, but only a very few individuals have the good fortune to be pushed into an editorial chair and to be presented with a yearly salary running into six figures. But even a former president should know that, with winter staring them in the face, the wage earners cannot afford to part with their last cent merely to help big business prosper even more.",
                "Another suggestion for saving the sinking ship is to refrain from cutting wages. Has this been done? Just ask the employees of our large department stores that are owned by big business about their pay envelopes. Their answers will convince even the most optimistic that \"high\" wages are nothing but editorial hokum.",
                "At the present time, the only people who are considered to receive a decent wage are those engaged in the building trade, and whenever the builders sign a contract they never fail to stress that point. But the contractor always forgets to mention the fact that, as a rule, part of the mechanic's Saturday check finds its way back to the contractor's pocket the following Monday. If not, the worker will find himself minus a job.",
                "An example of the insincerity of this pretense of paying high wages is shown most clearly by the policy of the Southern Power Company, which is typical of many other large industries. \"Come and get our cheap labor\" is their sales cry. Nor do they fail to mention that \"the labor laws of the State of Georgia are very liberal, since they permit sixty hours' work per week and contain no regulations as to the number of hours per day\".",

This sudden migration of our Northern industrial lords to the South, where labor is cheap and submissive, refutes the lies \"dished out\" to the unsuspecting public by all our \"optimistic\" editorial scribes, including Mr. Coolidge. But surely he, at least, should know the truth, since he resides in a state that was hit hardest by the sudden migration of numerous textile factories to the South.",

On the contrary, these industrial vampires, instead of trying to establish a fairly decent standard of living for the American worker, are interested only in the personal profit--and more profit."

But actions always speak louder than words, and the actions of the industrial leaders clearly show they are preparing for battle, to crush the unions wherever there is a weak link.",
                "There are many reasons for the lack of force in our present day labor organizations. For instance, many workers, who really are eager to devote their whole life to the success of Unionism, are kept from helping the cause on account of the exorbitant dues demanded for the privilege of becoming a member.",
                "Since the Union means strength, it is clearly the duty of every organized worker to see that his brother worker gets a fair chance to join the ranks of organized labor. If deprived of this right, who can blame the same brother worker if he turns against his union brother eventually, with as bitter resentment as the industrial masters themselves.",
                "Every worker should be afforded the opportunity to carry a union card. Within a short time, the workers, through their organized strength, will become the main factor in American life. The workers of the world should unite. By so doing, they have nothing to lose, but everything to gain."

The attempt to get some of the $8.63 which now go into the pockets of the non-producing classes, will not succeed as long as the tools for production and the finished products belong to the capitalist class.

The secret, if there is one, would be valuable because it has proved a necessity for people of modern civilization to work in unity if they are to avoid class hatred and serious struggles between classes.",

He had an idea that there was some sort of connection between the Folk High Schools and the co-operative system, but just how it worked he did not know. Naturally he thought that co-operation was taught as a subject in the schools, and he wanted to describe the procedure of such instruction, which supposedly was for the purpose of starting the younger generation on the road to co-operative success.",

They do not do so because the technical part of co-operative organization is comparatively easy to manage. There are always experts who are capable of handling that. The main obstacle to the success of co-operative enterprise is a spiritual obstacle. Co-operation is possible only for these people who feel that they have something in common which they love and want to protect. That feeling of the existence of a common object and of mutual responsibility has been fostered by the Folk High Schools by means of appealing to the pupils' interest in history."

We quote from the article: \"I journeyed to Copenhagen with a professor from the State University, who was delivering extensive lectures throughout the country. I learned that Copenhagen was a socialist city, and had been in the hands of that party for a number of years, and I found that many merchants and professional men were Socialists. But they were not revolutionary Socialists, and they have not transformed Copenhagen into a Socialist commonwealth. They have tried to do for the laboring classes what the farmer has done for himself in the country. Through cooperation, they own their own central bakeries,groceries, and laundries. They, too, buy and sell in a group, and in this way they have cut down the cost of living on the one hand, and increased the wages on the other. Like the farmer, they, too, have been greedy for education.....\"",

                "Can wealth be created by destroying wealth? That, today, is the uppermost question confronting any thinking person caught in the clutches of our economic structure. Those who have been guided by false propaganda, whose brains, from lack of usage have become atrophied, might easily accept the gesture of the great Washington brain-trust as a panacea for our national ills. But those who have not entirely surrendered the individual right to think for themselves, take the food destroying program proposed by the dignitaries at the Capitol, as both contradictory and criminal.",
                "That it should be necessary to destroy two billion pounds of cotton, millions of bushels of corn, as well as similar cuantities of wheat, and other commodities, to create wealth seems incredible as well as inhuman to any person. In fact, if such logic is the result of a highly trained academic mind, then those of us who have not been so exposed should thank our lucky stars for having escaped a college education.",
                "Until now, such destructive measures were interpreted as criminal, and those who perpetrated them were sent to jail or a madhouse. Today, such brilliant actions are rewarded by making the performers the counselors of the nation. As an illustration let us consider a glazier, who, in order to stimulate trade, takes these steps. One day he has suddenly found business dull, and has too much glass on hand. Accordingly, he hires thugs to destroy as many windows as possible. Then orders will begin to roll in, and be can get rid of surplus stock at a profit. In the eyes of the world, not excluding our own government, his destructive tactics are criminal and punishable by law. If caught, he is put behind bars. Now Washington itself wants to fall into the category of racketeers and hoodlums. At least, the guilty glazier has paid his hirelings out of his own pocket, but the government pays for the destruction of crops with the taxpayers' money, the very taxpayer who is sadly in need of the food laid waste.",
                "It has been said that the spirit of today may become the reality of tomorrow. If that be true, then God help us! If it is right to waste and destroy perfectly good food by the billions of pounds today, at a time when it is needed by our own people, to say nothing of wretched people of other countries, then it might be equally right tomorrow, it we start to destroy bridges, buildings, and other property, with a similar purpose. Maybe after we have succeeded in destroying everything, we will finish by destroying even ourselves.",
                "Certainly it would be more humane and reasonable--yet no more expensive, if our government would ship this surplus food to the starving countries of China and India for the cost of transportation. But why go elsewhere when we can do missionary work right at home. While thousands of children and good souls are starving, how can we sit back and firmly destroy food--for any theory whatsoever?",
                "If it be true that wealth can be created by destroying wealth, then how come that the war-ridden nations of Europe, whose structures were demolished, crops destroyed and fields made sterile, and national resources diminished are not flourishing? This historical example, is all the more convincing because it is contemporary, and should suffice to show even a brain-trust the folly of such a course."

The reds' chief opportunity is the confusion and breakdown of capitalism from within which is noticeable in Germany and everywhere else. Only a complete readjustment of human labor values in accordance and co-ordination with wonderfully expanded productive facilities, to be accomplished largely by means of a personal income surtax, property graded up to one hundred per cent, will suffice as the fundamental step toward social and economic rejuvenation upon a basis of individualism and freedom and for taking the ground from under communism."

This time, not to save democracy, but to save our present capitalistic system. Never before, in the annals of man, have the international bankers, hiding behind the smoke-screen of the League of Nations, shown more keenly that their wits are being put to the supreme test.

The international bankers, the League of Nations, if you wish, in order to save crumbling capitalistic Europe from going communistic, had no alternative but to start another war and promptly they engaged the armies of despotic Japan to set the ball rolling.",

That has been done by allowing Japan to occupy the whole of Manchuria, an area of 390,000 square miles. With Manchuria temporarily in the hands of Japan, Russia is now surrounded on all sides by hostile armies and might at the slightest pretense, who knows, be served with an ultimatum.",

This is hypothetical but very logical, judging from facts, that is, reading between the lines and peaking \"behind the scenes.\" And so, our leaders will try to save imperialistic capitalism and in so doing will retard the cause of liberty for at least another hundred years."

Then came the World War, with demand increased to the extent that every available American worker found himself confronted with more than enough work to satisfy him, and with wages unheard of before. In short, the worker was able to enjoy a period of plenty. At the close of the War there came a period of depression, and from 1919 to 1922 the workers again felt a shortage of jobs. The depression of the early twenties was due to the sudden closing of our ammunition plants, which employed a vast number of people, and to the return of our soldiers, who soon joined the ranks of the unemployed.",

                "About 25 years ago I had the pleasure, for the first time of attending a meeting in the well-known Greif's Hall on Lake Street where Mr. Morgan was the principal speaker. To advocate Socialism in those days took men of courage, brains and integrity. Morgan was one of them, small of build, but great of spirit. He attracted thinking people like a magnet. His irony and satirical criticism would make a laughing stock of selfish, ignorant and dishonest persons preying on society. Unfailingly he would emerge as the victor in a debate. No wonder the newspapers called him \"the silver tongued orator\". He was the very soul of the Socialistic movement, its untiring moral and financial supporter.",
                "An army of ambitious persons generally follow important movements, and their motives for support originate in selfishness. As a rule they are watching developements at a distance ready to act when an opportunity appears for them to enrich themselves to the detriment of the movement. Morgan was observing and quick to identify these parasites, and he attacked them mercilessly. He saw clearly that if there was to be hope for the Socialist party to survive and win public approval it was of extreme importance to keep it free of dishonest and corruptive elements.",
                "Instead of covering up corrupt affairs, a practice so commonly used by the old parties, Morgan wanted criticism to sweep through our social structure like a refreshing gale removing old dust and cobwebs. To this principle he adhered faithfully until his death.",
                "The result was of course that Morgan saw his criticism and stern attitude reflect upon himself. He had a host of enemies who spared no efforts to expell him from the party; but his would-be political assassins did not succeed. Morgan's many years of honest work and sacrifice for the benefit of the party had inspired the majority of the members with unshaken faith in his integrity, so he withstood his enemies sinister attacks. Only death could defeat the old champion.",
                "For the sake of our party let us hope that a great number of brother members will take up the fight to uphold the ideals so faithfully pursued by the late Thomas J. Morgan. Then we can look forward to the future with confidence and be sure our goal will be reached.",

                "Be it a fact that industrialism and mass production have practically rendered the old crafts and small scale farming useless. Now we must begin to think, about what is going to replace the capitalistic system. When making a study of how the feudal system was upheld by collecting rent and assessments, how and why it collapsed and was abolished, we may be able to imagine how the state of the future is going to take over the productive machinery of the country now privately owned.",
                "When we study institutions already operated by the state, we may conceive how Socialistic methods are going to be applied universally in the future. When thus having investigated the past and present of human enterprise, we may be able to judge whether or not collective action and a publicly owned productive machinery can become a reality. It is futile to believe that justice is going to be a determining fact in future developments. Developments will be brought about through sheer necessity and as an unavoidable consequence of capitalistic falsehood.",
                "To illustrate his point, the author permits one of his characters tell a story describing the stages of development modern society will have to go through before it can be called a true democracy. As in \"Looking Backward\" by Bellamy, the author's intercessor is a young man who awakens in the midst of a new society and is almost overwhelmed by the change. The story by Anatole France is somewhat shorter, and does not go so much into detail as does Bellamy's; but as a modern supposition, it is as brisk and liberal in its aspects.",
                "Anatole France has written books finer and purer and more sparkling than this one as far as the language is concerned. It is interesting to note, however, how a genius as critical and keen as Anatole France takes the revolutionary problem into consideration and declares himself openly in favor of the labor movement and its goal."

                "One of the darkest chapters in the history of the American labor movement has been written through the unexpected confession by the McNamara brothers of the crimes of which they have been accused. When they were arrested about half a year ago, for having, among other things, occasioned the explosion in the Los Angeles Times building in which half a dozen people were killed, organized labor and the Socialists took their side without hesitation, not only because they were considered entirely innocent, but especially because they were kidnapped illegally by the authorities in one state, and put in jail in another state. The chief attorney of the accused ones, Clarence Darrow, now reveals that from the very first he knew that the brothers were guilty, and that his goal has only been to save them from the gallows. During all this, the labor unions and the socialists have collected a defence fund of about $200,000, the greater part of which has passed through Mr. Darrow's hands or into his pockets. Without scruples he has accepted and used this money although he knew it was obtained under false pretences, and that no considerable part of the amount would have been contributed for the defence of two plain criminals.",
                "Clarence Darrow has, in time past done good service for the labor class without, however, closing his eyes to the amount in it for Mr. Darrow. In the present case, his expensive labor has been of doubtful value because through open confessions at the time of their arrest the accused ones would no doubt have obtained as mild a degree of punishment as under the deal now arranged to the trumpets of capitalism.",
                "The fact that the confessions came just at the present moment is no doubt due to the calculations by the authorities and the capitalists as to the immediate influence thereof on the election in Los Angeles where the Socialists might be considered as practically having the victory in their hands. On this point the calculations proved well considered. But the Socialists do not need to worry over this. The McNamara scandal, of course, did not keep a single Socialist from voting for the party's candidates. If the scandal had not been there and the Socialists had won, it would have been by the aid of non-Socialist votes, and a victory obtained in such manner is of doubtful value. We can afford to wait, and after all, 40,000 Socialists votes is a worth while basis on which to build.",
                "For that matter, the Socialists may well wash their hands of this whole matter. Aside from a handful of revolutionists or anarchists, calling for direct action, the task of the Socialists is to improve the conditions of the workers through political activity and gradual parliamentary reconstruction of the present system. The pure and simple labor union movement on the other hand has no such ideal, or on the whole any other means to use except strikes and boycotts. When these fail, when the capitalists, by means of servile law makers, police officers and other means of action, oppress the workers more and more, while at the same time the leaders of these workers fraternize with the employers, prattling about harmony between labor and capital, then, of course, there may always be found such within the ranks, as will be tempted to use the tactics of despair which so often find expression here in America, and which was employed by the McNamara brothers. There is every reason to believe that the capitalist class prefers these tactics, even coupled with destruction and murder, which at times the class undoubtedly helps to organize, rather than a fully class conscious and Socialist labor movement. The capitalists well know that such a movement is the only one which they need really to fear. This explains why it is that while all honest and sensible workers, and especially the Socialists, have taken a decided stand against the McNamaras, some of the capitalist papers are about to make them heroes acting from noble motives; and it may be taken for granted that while they now will be living at the expense of the state, the state will see to it that they are taken well care of."

P. Morgan. That particular incident now belongs to history, and serves only as an indication of Teddy's dwindling ferocity, in his role of the thundering lion.",
                "Far more significant, painting as it does, towards far reaching social-economical and political changes is the statement by the president of the Steel Trust himself, Judge Gary, before the investigating committee, that, in his opinion, the old era of destructive competition has come to an end, and that the price of all products in interstate commerce, should be fixed by a federal commission, and subject to revision by the Federal courts. A similar opinion was expressed by Attorney General Wickersham before the Minnesota State Bar Association, when he stated as his belief that free competition no longer existed. He went on to say that supply and demand are no longer the price-determining factors, having been superseded by an agreement among the big trusts. Official court action against the latter was always based on the earlier condition, and is, therefore, now ineffective. Not even the tariff can be used to change this situation. The Attorney General stated flatly that competition is dying if it is not already dead, and recommended Federal control and regulation of prices, as already advocated by Judge Gary.",
                "Later, persons close to such business grants as Rockfeller, Morgan and Carnegie, have been talking in the same vein; it is, therefore, evident that this realization of the desirability of Federal control is not simply the idea of a few individual, isolated theorists, but that a complete change of front has taken place by America's business and industrial leaders.",

We have street meetings, and lectures in our auditoriums. The work is progressing, steadily and systematically. We have the most gifted and zealous lecturers in the country, men like Russel, Irvine, Debs and Spargo. The ablest journalists, the most famous authors, and the greatest scientists belong to us. And above all, we have the workers themselves. They are the ones that carry the movement, personifying its strength and vitality.

All party members are therefore requested to desist from any activities, which go contrary to the interests of the organizations of the working class.

Militarism never has and never will be a permanent cure for unemployment. The fact that he knows and admits that the present social order leaves much to be desired is evidence of a deep study of conditions. Such conscientious study by men of Lloyd George's ability and character will finally bring to the notice of the world at large that the only unfailing cure for present social ills is Socialism, pure and simple."

                "However, it is not inconceivable that a reaction in both Europe and America may bring on a war of many nations,welcoming such a war as a remedy for the widespread unemployment throughout the world. The exporting of thousands of workers as cannon fodder and the wholesale destruction of properties will provide capitalists with a wonderful opportunity for double profit. The destruction and following reconstruction periods would be welcome indeed; and workers remaining at home will enjoy the blessings of high wages to be followed by poverty and suffering when the bubble bursts.",

They delivered a clear and concise lecture on socialism, its ideals, and woman's part in the movement, and delivered an urgent appeal to those present to take an active part in promoting the ideals of socialism wherever possible.

                "History reveals that, throughout the world, new social orders are continuously supplanting the old to meet the demands of the everchanging social and economic conditions. In olden times all manual labor was performed by slaves either owned as chattels or bound by claims created by the exhisting conditions. Following slavery came the era of serfdom whereby the worker was enslaved as completely as before. In fact it was probably worse on the laborer because his titled master organized more of the proprietary responsibility of the slave owner.",

The working man is free to sell his services to the best advantage; employer and employee enjoy the privilege of equality in bargaining for service. This is true to outward appearance only. In reality the laborer is still at a disadvantage. The worker of today is as much a distinct class as ever. A few individuals or small groups own all the land, buildings, factories, machinery and raw materials and have a monoply on every item needed on an entire nation, while the working man with empty hands has to beg for an opportunity to earn bare necessities of life.",

                "It would not be fair to blame the socialists for being delighted over the present condition of business. As good citizens, they are anxious to keep the social machinery functioning normally, as long as it cannot be replaced by something new and better. They are the ones who are hit first and hardest when times are bad because they belong to the working class rank and file. On the other hand, they are not at all willing to share the opinion of capitalists who, in spite of a general economic depression and  considerable unemployment, maintain that everything is all right. Please take note that this is the situation under a Republican administration and that in its essence, it does not differ from that which prevailed in 1893 under the Democratic administration.",
                "How long the crisis will last, whether it will go on record as the crisis of 1907, 1908, or 1909, or whether it has reached its peak or will do so in two or three years, no one can tell until it is all over and conditions improve. A crisis is a constitutional disease afflicting the capitalistic social body incurable as long as political quackery, imposition of hands, and closing one's eyes and ears are the only remedies offered.",
                "President Roosevelt may brand the crisis as being foolish, but this will neither shorten nor lengthen the evil. His warning against hoarding money is just as futile, because the scarcity of money is but a result of the industrial crisis, not vice versa. The industrial crisis is a result of maldistribution or disharmony between production and distribution. The productive capacity of American industries is enormous and so is the possibility of a market, if the majority of benefits were not seized by an idle upper class while the workers, the actual producers, are hardly allowed to exist.",
                "Society, as it is now organized, will survive the crisis and work itself towards health and some degree of prosperity again, but only temporarily. Sooner or later the crisis will again repeat itself, and so will go on indefinitely until the actual causes incorporated in the very system are removed."

                "An industrial crisis is a noted phenomenon of modern civilization. Time and time again, every civilized country is hit by a profound disturbance in its industrial, financial, and commercial life, and as a rule the setback occurs at a time when the majority of people, even those directly engaged in business, believe that all is well and there is no threatening danger. Then suddenly, in the midst of bustling activity, with contractors working at full capacity, manufacturing plants loaded with orders, mines and railroads paying handsome dividends and somewhat higher wages than usual, a change for the worse sets in. The commodity price level hitherto high now declines abruptly. The business world is gripped with fear and distrust. There is a race for opportunities to gain possession of liquid capital through the sale of securities, goods, or through bank loans, all of which contribute to a general crisis throughout the nation or, as it now appears, throughout several nations, without anybody knowing definitely how and why it all happened.",
                "If it were at all possible to determine the cause of such repeated financial and industrial disturbances, people would be forced to take precautions and take steps to lessen the damage done when the inevitable happens.",
                "At various times earthquakes, droughts, floods, cyclones, insects, and epidemics have all caused serious disturbances in the business world. Several such disorders have had more than local and immediate effect. As science has progressed and knowledge has become more universal we have succeeded in counteracting some of these evils and preventing some of the damages which might otherwise be the result of these spasmodic acts of nature. However, no one believes that we will ever be able to eliminate the dangers, or that future generations will ever succeed in having the weather at their command, even though it has actually been proved that drought can be treated effectively by using explosives in the upper regions.",
                "Many a business crisis of the middle ages can be directly attributed to drought and floods as certainly as similar phenomena have a depressing effect on business in China, India, Russia and even now to some extent in the United States. It is a recognized fact however that such calamities could be counteracted by transferring the surplus from one district or country to another. In earlier days it was customary to accumulate a surplus in years of prosperity, to be distributed in times of distress. It is more than likely that in our quest for progress and development we have entirely forgotten the importance of saving for a rainy day or perhaps, we are pushing developments in the wrong direction.",
                "At least it is a fact, that previous to the establishment of the capitalistic system of production, under which commodities are produced for speculative purposes by means of \"free\" wage-earning workers, never before did a business crisis occur as a consequence of overproduction of commodities necessary for the salvation of the population.",
                "Of course, periods of distress in earlier days were felt first and foremost by the poor, exactly as is the case now. During the times of ancient civilizations based on the exploitation of slaves, and also during the period of feudalism for that matter, the contrast between the luxury of the rich and the misery of the poor was even more appaling than it is today during periods of depression; but modern crisis differ distinctly in the which they always occur and cause the most suffering among the poor at a time when there is a surplus of the things they need, the themselves produced.",
                "As long as the worker, farmer or mechanic, produces only what he and his family consumes or sells in the local market for immediate consumption; as long as he is the owner of his tools, farm and raw material, and sells his own products directly, he has some degree of control over his own destiny. But technical developments have forced him into a position of wage earner, together with fellow wage earners that produce at the command of an employer who in turn floods the market with the products. When this system became universal, two opposing factions of the wealth-producing machinery of the nation were created. The workers labored no longer as individuals; they worked in cooperation and accelerated specialization placed the individual as a smaller and smaller part of the force called labor which produces goods not for individual consumption, but for purposes and uses foreign to the very producers. Under this system the actual producers have no control over either the tools or the raw materials, no claim to ownership of the products, and no voice in the matter of distribution. They are wage earners, nothing else; working for a salary which is regulated on the basis of an average standard of living maintained by the groups to which they belong, and which is but a fraction of the value of their own production.",
                "Individual ownership of the products has been abolished for the benefit of the capitalist or the employer who is in charge of the distribution. The worker's contribution to human welfare in general is that of producing goods. The employers, as an individual, considers the goods his property to be used or to be disposed of at his will, which means that the products are not going to be used or disposed of unless he can realize a profit. This, in its essence, is the fundamental difference between the individual owner, who is producer and distributor in one, and the individual controller of the specialized mass production.",
                "Orthodox economists, even some of those who pretend to be socialists, overlook the difference between individual and collective production, the latter being subject to capitalistic control. Many insist that there is, in fact, no difference between the worker and the capitalist, which theory contradicts the philosophy of their great teacher, Adam Smith, who discovered that employers were constantly active to prevent a rise in wages.",
                "However, it is this essential difference in methods of production that cause the industrial, commercial, and financial disturbances so frequent in modern civilization.",
                "Instead of acknowledging this cause, economists come forth with the most absurd explanations each time the nation is hit by a crisis of which overproductions, glutted markets, unemployment, and destitution are familiar aspects.",
                "For instance, we have often been told that a crisis comes as a result of overpopulation. Many economists are of that opinion, despite repeated proof to the effect that the ratio between the increase of productive capacity and the increase of population is steadily widening, and is now more distinctly in favor of the former than ever. The fact that the United States was not and could not have been overpopulated prior to the crisis in 1856 and again in 1872, and yet had hundreds of thousands unemployed and perhaps millions working part time during these periods, should be sufficient to prove the fallacy of that theory.",
                "Others hold that overproduction is the real cause of a crisis.",
                "That philosophy is without foundation in so far as there are thousands of people ready to absorb the supposed surplus the moment their labor is accepted in exchange.",
                "Then we have the monetary quacks who attribute all economic disturbances to either a scarcity or an abundance of money in circulation, notwithstanding the fact that crises, identical in aspects and effects, have occured during periods of both.",
                "We have economic experts who seek a solution by explaining that a crisis is a consequence of crop failures. Furthermore, if crop failures are said to be caused by sunspots, economic evils would supposedly be derived more or less directly from solar phenomenon. Unfortunately, a bumper harvest preceded one of the worst crises of this century, thereby questioning the accuracy of the theory of sunspots having any more to do with it than the spots on a leopard.",
                "Except for that of the school of thought represented by Karl Marx, the best explanation of the causes of economic crises ever presented, is a simple analysis of the preceding symptoms, such as wild speculation, a race to establish new business enterprises, the gullibility with which the public invest money in dubious undertakings, a get-rich-quick-and-easy fever, a rising price level, increased luxury, increasing demand for manual labor, and higher wages, etc. These all are symptoms of an impending crisis, but instead of being the actual causes they should be regarded as consequences of maneuvers taking place behind the scene.",
                "Returning to our point of view as expressed previously, on the basis of historical facts we are able to prove the origin of the difference between collective production for individual seizure, and the method of limited individual production prevailing throughout the Middle Ages.",
                "As a consequence of the change in method, technical improvements and scientific developments turned out to be of benefit only to the capitalist and employer who surged ahead, ridding himself of all restrictions, opening and controlling new markets for his products. On account of the rapid technical developments, which began at the close of the nineteenth century and resulted in a universal system of mass production, the monopoly held by the capitalists threatened the welfare of society more and more.",
                "The differences between capital and labor broadened in scope at an accelerated speed. Of course, every manufacturer is eager to make hay while the sun shines. When the market is good he keeps his factory operating at capacity. He either employs more workers, or lets his regular staff work overtime so that they can earn more and keep up with rising prices. Employer as well as employee commit the same blunder by thinking only of personal profit. That is part and parcel of free competition. Every employer is not only forced to preserve his establishment, but to improve and expand it. There are good and bad employers, but they all have to follow the trend in developments or they will lose their standing.",
                "The recent organization of trusts and rings, of course, has had some stabilizing effect on the system of production, but at the same time it has increased the disproportion between production and distribution by removing the worker still farther from ownership of his own products. An industry may organize as a ring and thereby double its production and profit, but it does not double the workers' wages. In other words, increased productive capacity and accelerated speed of production is not counterbalanced by a corresponding increase in purchasing power; again we have the crisis, which often lasts for years, with prices declining, bankruptcies, glutted markets, unemployment, etc.",
                "What happened is simply that the capitalists proved themselves unable to guide a nation's productive forces. Their system of production and method of distribution were off balance.",
                "While we have pointed out the causes of an industrial crisis, at the same time, we have offered a remedy for this evil.",
                "Involuntarily, society has begun to take advantage of this remedy."

However, his statements caused such a shower of protests from members of his own party that he was on the verge of losing his candidacy, so he is now trying to modify his utterances.",

                "John D. Rockefeller reveals a rather pleasant disposition on the occasion of his company's being fined $29,240,000; and why not? The fine, if ever paid, will be paid only by raising the price on Standard Oil products. On the other hand, the legal prosecution means little to Standard Oil. The trust and all the rest of Rockefeller's business enterprises will suffer a loss only in public prestige on account of the adverse publicity. Nevertheless, this annoys the old capitalistic giant. We refer to an article in the Record Herald, with such headlines as the following: \"Hit Me, Hurt All.\" says Rockefeller. \"Attacks on Corporate Wealth Injure Poor More Than Rich, He Argues.\" \"Thinks he is Benefactor.\" \"Makes Works for Thousands and Opens Opportunities for Thousands More.\"",
                "Such headlines indicate clearly Rockefeller's attitude and are absolutely correct. As long as the capitalistic system is to be maintained at all and we are to have economic guardianship, Rockefeller is as good and able as anybody. To kick him out and divide his monopolies among a dozen or more capitalists of smaller calibre wouldn't improve the situation one particle. It would not in any way abolish the system of starvation wages, nor do away with the rich loafers living in luxury. A more determined prosecution of Rockefeller and Company would hardly be advisable either, because the only result would be a disturbance in the business world, and scramble for chances on the part of other capitalists. Determined action on the part of the Government would be the only solution. We need a Government that would have the courage to tell the capitalists: \"Get out of here, we are going to run the country for the benefit of the people.\" Under such a Government, Rockefeller and his henchmen would be helpless and unable to cause a panic, even if they wanted to. Half-baked reforms, as advocated by Roosevelt, would be worse than none at all."

                "\"A Socialist writes that, once socialism is established, class struggle will have come to an end. But don't you think there will be at least two classes under socialist rule as well? There will be the ambitious, who want to work, and the lazy, who do not want to work. How are the former going to make the latter do their duty? I mean, not merely apparently, but in reality. Because you can be reasonably sure there will be smart people under socialist rule also. It has been said that socialism will eliminate the incentive for stealing; but what about the time thieves?\"",
                "A writer who, in efforts to defend the old time let-it-go-as-it-is philosophy, voices that kind of objection, is not far from being unduly comical or, may be rather tragicomical, like children and old women seeing ghost in broad daylight.",
                "The fear of laziness under a socialist system, we suspect, is a result of the acknowledgement that a lot of people are trying to avoid their duties as workers under the old system. The question is therefore: will that tendency be aggravated under socialism or will it be effectively curbed?",
                "The writer himself, we hope, is willing to admit that conditions are far from ideal right now. We have not alone a lot of people who do not want to do any work; we have a number of people who are not allowed to work, people suffering from the effects of seasonal unemployment and having no greater desire than that of being allowed to work. The latter kind would be more than happy for the better paid and less tedious work available under a system of socialism; while a large army of strike-breakers, employed in order to maintain a low wage standard, is a virtual necessity for the preservation of capitalism.",
                "Maybe also the majority of those who are apparently too lazy to work, and therefore try to keep the wolf from the door by turning to crime, would return to honest employment if such was offered them under more humane conditions than those prevailing under the system of exploitation which threw them on the human junk heap. There would be less excuse for their actions and ways, and therefore they would arouse less sympathy. Moreover, a Socialist government is likely to do more in the way of reforming them, if necessary, by means of a reasonable degree of compulsion, in order to make them useful citizens. Most likely there would be but a few recruits to join their ranks, and their \"race\" would therefore vanish from the surface of the earth sooner or later.",
                "Another group, the parasites who live in luxury, avoiding work of any kind from cradle to grave, will be eliminated completely under a socialist system and will have to look for other means of support. Why does not the writer mention these loafers of both sexes, whose luxury and debauchery cost the country more than do all the poor devils and criminals combined?",
                "Together with the capitalist aristocracy goes an army of servants and people who thrive on the falsehood of capitalism and who are, in effect, also loafers and thieves of time. All these would have an opportunity for useful employment under a well organized socialist system.",
                "The final adjustment of these conditions will be made when the time is ripe for socialism's principles of equality and justice to be carried out in practice. It is absurd to believe that a system based on these principles should be more attractive for permanent loafers than the one we have, or that the incentive to work should disappear in the face of a prospect for the full benefit of labor. It is no more likely to happen than it is for one wheel on a two-wheeled wagon in forward motion to turn the other way."

The telegraph companies have even the nerve to insist that the strike is over, despite the fact that 20,000 to 25,000 men, or about 95% of the telegraphists of Western Union, Postal Co., and Associated Press, are out on strike; and there is no immediate danger that amateur scabs are going to take their jobs, because it takes years to acquire the training.",

                "Many of those who read the Chicago Daily Socialist, also read one or more of the capitalistic papers, and, of course, that is the right thing to do. On the other hand, opponents of socialism should read the Daily Socialist; thus all would keep themselves posted on the matter viewed from different angles. As things stand at present, however, many readers of the Daily Socialist are at a loss to understand the attitude capitalistic papers now take towards the Idaho murder case. Whatever course of action these papers have taken before and immediately after commencement of the Court procedure, what they thought of the three suspects being guilty or not guilty, you will hardly be able to find a single editor in the whole country by now who is too blind to realize that the prosecutors have not produced a speck of evidence provind the defendants' guilt. Had this been an ordinary murder case with traditional sensational aspects, comments in favor of the suspects would have been published far and wide; stern demands for freeing the three men, and prosecution of their jailers for conspiracy would have been current subjects throughout the country.",
                "But this is not an ordinary murder case. Its origin and course is a typical by- product of class hatred and class struggle. It was started by a shameless capitalistic organization with the object of putting a strong and courageous labor organization out of existence, and the object has been pursued mercilessly. That is why the capitalistic papers decidedly took sides with the prosecutors and approved their unconstitutional way of arresting the suspects by actually kidnapping them and hauling them across a state line to Idaho. That is why the same papers maintain a strict silence now when it is proper to publish the fact that the case is decidedly in favor of the defense. They can't deny the failure of the prosecutors to prove the men guilty, and they don't want to admit their own folly before they know the decision arrived at by a servile capitalistic judge and a jury, picked as much in favor of the prosecutors as possible. Even a decision contradicting law and justice will be approved by the defenders of capitalism and so their press must refrain from thwarting the case with comments unfavorable to the higher-ups.",
                "The papers are silent--editorially; as far as their less responsible correspondents are concerned, the field is open and extensively used now, as heretofore, to present the case in favor of the prosecutors and to defame the characters of the accused men worse than ever.",
                "Of course this attitude on the part of the capitalistic press reflects itself in various Scandinavian echo-papers, as is always the case on such occasions; and oftentimes the echoes are rather malicious, because the articles written by the irresponsible correspondents of the capitalistic papers are resurrected in the Scandinavian papers as editorials. Thus a Danish paper published in New York brands Mayer and Haywood as \"a pair of criminals,\" which judgment, we maintain, is a limit of frankness yet to be exceeded by any other paper in this country. Here is an example from one of Rasmussen's papers published last week: \"Among other witnesses ex-Governor Peabody of Colorado and his daughter have testified from the stand; but their statements only confirm what Orchard (who turned state evidence) has said, that Haywood, Mayer and Pettibone were responsible for the assassination of Governor Stennenberg.\"",
                "Well what about these \"confirming\" statements? Oh yes! Orchard had \"confessed\" that ex-Governor Peabody was one of the men he was supposed to kill at the order of Mayer, Haywood and Pettibone. As witness appeared the ex-Governor himself to testify to the effect that he had seen Orchard in Canon City at the very time Orchard himself insisted he had been there for the purpose of \"letting him have it.\" A still more marvelous \"evidence\" was furnished by the ex-Governor's daughter, who said that she had seen two suspicious persons in the proximity of her carriage once while her father was Governor!",
                "That was all! but it is an excellent example of the shaky foundation on which the case has been built. Orchard might easily have been in Canon City a hundred times, ignorant of the fact that he was believed to have come there with an intention to kill Governor Peabody. Still less founded is the suggestion, that the labor leaders had hired Orchard to do so. For that matter he could just as well have told he was hired by President Roosevelt to do the job, or by Chr. Rasmussen of Minneapolis, or the editor of this paper. Ex-Governor Peabody's and his daughter's testimonies would have served the purpose just the same. We believe that people who possess the ability to reason and are not willing to lie on their stomachs for the captains of capitalism will protest when such nonsense is admitted as evidence. Such unfair procedure instead of convincing them, will strengthen their belief in the innocence of the three men, an innocence which has been more and more apparent in the course of the court proceedings."

In fact the tremendous progress they have made in Finland was a virtual blow to the triumphants, not to mention what success they have had in Russia and lately in Austria. Whether they like it or not the capitalists have to reckon with such evidence of vitality on the part of the socialistic movement. They cannot deny that it is progressing all over the civilized world. Says the Evening Mail of New York: \"It is the worst of folly for defenders of conservatism and individualism throughout the world to blind themselves to the steady advance of the ever increasing strength of the socialist movement in every country. The Austrian election is merely the latest warning of a peril common to the nations. The assault upon property rights, religion and the family comes earlier in Europe than in America. But sooner or later it will be our turn to face it.\"",
                "Sooner or later also it will be \"our\"job that is: The defenders of capitalism to meet the socialists on the battle-ground of realities. The outworn phrases about annihilation of property rights, religion and the family life will soon cease to have effect. The kind of property rights that permit an upper class to prey on labor is objectionable in the opinion of the socialists and should be abolished for the benefit of the state in order to permit the existence of actual property rights, and to provide an opportunity for everybody to acquire property as long as he is willing and able to work for it. But to proclaim that this will interfere with a man's religious views and family life is plain nonsense.In all fairness we hold that a man shall be entitled to the fruits of his labor instead of being compelled to hand most of it over to a parasitical upper class who produce nothing themselves.",

But this very attitude on the part of the ent did also serve to open the eyes of the workers. The case, originally scheduled for the purpose of crushing the Western Federation of Miners,  served to raise and strengthen the brotherly feeling among the workers of the nation in a most excellent way, and might turn out to be a bad boomerang for the capitalistic bosses and their hirelings throughout the country."

Lost of people do willingly admit that the Philippine Islands are the world's most expensive islands. Of course, the working population must pay the expenses, but this is not the cause for concern; the thing is that the plutocrats have begun to realize that instead of using all that money without getting satisfactory returns they could just as well use it like the rest of the wealth we produce for the benefit of the plutocrats.",

In fact robbery whether domestic or foreign, is considered a legitimate and patriotic enterprise in our days as long as it serves to promote the interests of the upper class. But a lot of money is being handled and spent without a reasonable make-off for the plutocrats. They think, of course, that this should be stopped."

                "However, President Roosevelt accidently revealed once more to which camp he actually belongs. Infuriated by his opponent's accusations and embarrassing evidence, Roosevelt compares him with the three suspected criminals Debs, Mayer and Haywood, classifying them all as \"undesirable citizens.\" In his last \"message,\" he used the selfsame expression about the socialists.",
                "Now as before, the socialists will, under ordinary circumstances, find the President's attitude amusing, or they may even feel pleased on account of the particular attention he devotes to them. Mr. Debs is not particularly worried because the capitalists' foremost representative wishes he were at Jericho, or in a place still hotter, but the President's attacks on Mayer and Haywood are extremely unfair and mean and have been a source of regret and condemnation in wide circles, even in the more liberal capitalistic press.",
                "As we all know, Mayer and Haywood are two of the three mine-workers' trusted agents who were virtually kidnaped from their homes and families in Colorado and transported to Idaho, where they have been held as prisoners now for over a year, all on account of a bum's \"confession\" to the effect that he had been hired by the two men to slay Governor Stennenberg of Idaho. Any real foundation for the charge has not been found, which probably accounts for the fact that they have been held prisoners for so long before being tried and thus be able to prove their innocence. Their arrest, which was unconstitutional, has been argued before the Supreme Court, which as expected, decided against the three men. There was however one of the Supreme Court Justices who had the courage to describe the case against the three men as grossly unfair and against the law, a result of a conspiracy between the authorities of the two states, who in turn are backed by the mine-owners and the powerful interests of the standard Oil Company.",
                "When even criminals whose guilt is unquestionable are considered innocent until proved guilty, it is the more inappropriate for the President of the country to condemn these men in advance when the charge against them is very doubtful; because he thereby endangers their lives, guilty or not guilty, that is, presuming the President speaks with authority. If it is true that once Roosevelt, as a Roughrider, shot a Spanish soldier in the back, the incident would be more forgivable than his attacks on the imprisoned labor leaders, which have caused much indignation not only among the hundreds of thousands who stubbornly believe the three men are innocent, but also on the part of every man whose sense of justice is not completely missing."

The cost of it all would be negligible compared with the vast sums of money squandered by the privileged class on comfort and pleasure."

                "Now and then the American press whose daily insults to our intelligence and integrity surely are hard enough pills for civilized people to swallow is indulging in a propaganda that appears wore like a paroxysm of insanity than journalism. Typical is its attitude towards the spoiled millionaire boy, Thaw, who on account of too easy access to money lost the bit of ability to reason he had and degenerated into a two-logged animal and ended as a murderer. A boy of that sort should be of interest to the public only as a product of the absurdity characterizing our social conditions. Had these been organized according to principles of decency such as advocated by the socialists a boy of his kind would either have been educated and trained to be a useful citizen or, if he had proved incurable, placed in an institution where he would be properly taken care of. He is a type and an example of the demoralizing effect of Capitalistic principles and deserves no more attention than any ordinary \"nut.\"",

Even the more decent and conservative papers are going the limit although they cannot measure up with the Hearst papers which consider it their duty to bring at least one new photo of the murderer and two and three of his wife every day. They have about a dozen male and female correspondents competing in writing the most hysterical stories.",

Fortunately therefore that there is at least one paper a person can read without being overwhelmed with murderous literature. This paper is the Chicago Socialist which brings a few short votes about the Thaw affair now and then and for the rest deals with more important matters."

What if the German Kaiser, for a while, is acting up in Venezuela; we do not have to see red and arm to the teeth. As to Germany, the German social democracy will probably in the near future take care of both the Kaiser and his war craze, and as far as our own country is concerned, we should certainly serve its interests, and further the well being of our people better, by spending millions of dollars, not on Men-of-War, but on useful public improvements, or for the betterment of living conditions of our old people, for our sick and poor, and the children of the poor.

At present these wards are to elect delegates to the four conventions (senate, congress, county, and state). Between ten and twenty-five delegates and alternates are to be elected from each ward. More than 1,000 jobs are available and the candidates are to be appointed for these jobs at these conventions. The final decision will be at the general election November 8."

He started out on a first-class Scandinavian oration, but proved to be too heretical in his views, and the president began to knock the table with his knuckles in order to call the gentlemen to order. But Mr. Allstross would not be put down so easily. He insisted on saying what he had to say, then and there. Then the crowd began to take sides with one party and the other, and there seemed to be a right lively chance for a gentle row. The bar-tender came to the rescue, and after bouncing one or two of the more noisy ones, order was restored again. Mr. Allstross subsided.",

He assured those present that he had been a Democrat until after the Republican Party came into power, and then be became a Republican. He now honestly hated the Democratic Party. It had no bottom to it."

Assuming that the mayor will be called upon to fill at least one vacancy by the appointment of a Democrat, the name of Peter J. Thornum [Dane] has been suggested as a fitting choice. Mr. Thornum is a West Sider, which certainly under the circumstances ought to be a strong point in his favor. He is a sturdy Democrat who has ever been ready to fight the battles of his party, never yielding or compromising, always striking straight from the shoulder. He is fearless and aggressively honest at all times, a man of sturdy backbone of the very kind that a civil service commissioner needs. He is the unanimous choice of the Scandinavian Democratic Central Club of Chicago for the position, and it may be added that the Scandinavians in general, without regard to party affiliations, would approve of his appointment as a civil service commissioner.",

But the Skandinaven takes pleasure in testifying to the worth of a fellow citizen than whom no better Democrat is to be found in these parts, and whose character and honesty are valued most highly by those who know him best. Mayor Harrison would make no mistake by appointing Peter Thornum as Robert Lindblom's successor."

                "The House in Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union had under consideration the bill (H. R. 9054) making appropriations for the Department of Agriculture for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1919.",
                "Mr. Juul: \"Mr. Chairman, some years ago as a member of a senatorial committee in my state, I visited the State University at Champaign and Urbana. Among the interesting things shown to the senators were certain machines for testing the resisting powers of wood and metal.",
                "\"I remember certain machines for testing timber: an upright piece of wood several feet long and probably six inches square was placed in this machine and pressure was applied. Over the machine was an indicator like a steam gauge, that recorded hundreds and thousands of pounds of pressure applied to the wood by the machine. I believe that finally, under ever so many thousand pounds of pressure, the fiber in the wood gave way and, technically speaking, it failed. The test had shown the number of thousands of pounds that that particular kind of wood could stand.",
                "\"Under the Constitution and laws of the United States it was contemplated that the enormous pressure that this World War is forcing upon the Congress was to be divided in approximately 434 parts, each part or unit of the House to stand at least a share of it, so that no single man should go to pieces or fail, either physically or mentally, trying to stand up under the strain all alone or by himself. (Laughter.)",
                "\"But by virtue of some system probably vogue for many years, before I and many of the gentlemen came here, it seems that the burden of the Government unjustly rests upon a very few gentlemen. I am now judging the situation by reading the Congressional Record, where I find that one gentleman addressed the House and had his name printed in the Record 118 times on a single day.\" (Laughter.)",
                "Mr. Garret of Tennessee: \"Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield?\"",
                "Mr. Juul: \"Oh, I will be through in half a minute.\"",
                "Mr. Garrett of Tennessee: \"Does the gentleman think it is entirely fair to make these remarks in the absence of the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Stafford)?\"",
                "Mr. Juul: \"I have mentioned no names. I want to say to the gentleman that once we had a police official out in Chicago who called the policemen together one morning in the squad room and said, 'I am not going to mention any names, but if Sorenson don't stop drinking, some policeman is going to lose his star.' (Laughter.)",
                "\"The question that is naturally agitating my mind is whether the one man, or the few men, having to stand the enormous strain has railed under it, or whether the four hundred and thirty-odd gentlemen have failed under the strain of watching the few gentlemen fail under the system of placing this enormous burden upon the shoulders of a dozen men. As a failure, it is best illustrated by the fact that the great number of men in the House have become so tenderhearted that the moment the grind starts and a few gentlemen start in addressing the House, thereby assuming all the burdens, all the rest of the members desert the hall and walk out or the building. (Laughter.) Did I say walk? No, I was mistaken; they do not walk out, they run out; and it is necessary to ring a bell three times to bring them back. And when they do come back and find that the same four or five gentlemen are still under pressure trying to carry the burden that 433 men should divide and carry, these four hundred-odd men immediately, when they have responded to their names, feel so badly that as soon as they have answered 'Here' to the call of their names, they again run out, feeling that things are being attended to so much better than they could possibly attend to them. (Laughter.)",
                "\"If one of the gentlemen who has come over to respond to his name should for a moment forget himself and ask for permission to help carry the burden and watch the indicator, helping the few gentlemen to stand the strain, he is immediately jumped on, sat on, and squelched, and in unmistakable manner informed that the proper place for the four hundred-odd gentlemen is over in the House office building addressing envelopes and mailing seeds to their constituents in the rural districts. (Laughter.)",
                "\"It is the hopeless situation created which compels the four hundred-odd gentlemen to come over and watch the indicator over the machine that is squeezing both the physical and mental life out of the half-dozen gentlemen that have succeeded in emptying the Hall of Congress so the average business is being transacted with about thirty gentlemen present. Count them now!",
                "\"And to my mind the indicator is pointing out that one hundred times a day for one gentleman, no matter what his attainments, is too much of a physical or mental strain, both for the gentleman who is to be under the terrific pressure and also for the four hundred-odd gentlemen who have to watch him to the point of breaking of failure. And let us be fair with one another. What would happen to a manager if he was running the biggest and best show on earth if he would send his star performer out to address the audience 118 times in a single evening? His show would 'bust,' that is all. (Laughter)",
                "\"When all other means have failed to drive the members away from the debates and back to the House office building, the following may be tried succesfully, and was tried the other day: A gentleman, not of the select few, had the audacity to attempt to participate in the debate and he was squelched by one of the select gentlemen in this manner: 'Has not the gentleman illustrated the fact that a little learning is sometimes a very dangerous thing?'",
                "\"In other words, a colleague on the floor is willing to hold up a brother member as ignorant in order to take the pep and grit out of him and thus prevent him from ever coming back; and the gentleman who used the floor over a hundred times in a single day rises and objects to another member having a few minutes of the House's time.",
                "\"Verily, advertising is a good thing; and verily, verily, I say unto you that he who bloweth not his own horn, his horn, it shall be bloweth. But is there not such a thing as blowing a horn a little too often? (Laughter.)",
                "\"Gentlemen, I want to say this: I have come on this floor and I have meant to participate. I have meant to work, I never was a shirker. I was the chairman on the judiciary in the senate of my state for a number of years, and I worked night and day; but I tell you it is mighty humiliating and awfully hard for all the new people to come in and be sat on and made to feel they are not wanted. I do not mean to say that is the intention of anybody to make any gentleman walk out of the hall with that feeling in his heart; but I want to tell you that I have done it time and time again when I have seen the younger members stand up here only to have somebody sit on them because the older members knew the ins and outs of business and the younger ones did not. I want to conclude by saying that you gentlemen who sit here and transact business every day are putting an entirely wrong gauge on the other fellows by thinking they are ignorant because they are silent.\" (Applause.)",
                "Mr. Leva: \"Mr. Chairman, I regret very much that the gentlemen to whom the speech seems to appeal are not present, but I hope they will read it in the Record tomorrow.\"",
                "Mr. Juul: \"I want to say to the gentleman that I have not mentioned any names. I wanted particularly to refrain from doing so.\""

P. Morgan and Co., and also in view of his record during two previous terms as President.",

In spite of the fact that we are his political opponents, we have the highest regard for Mr. Juul, due to his outstanding ability, absolute honesty and genuine Danish spirit and sentiment. To quote the Inter Ocean:",

Probably no man has made himself a more prominent figure in Illinois legislation in the last decade than this Chicago attorney. Along with the anti-children's crime law and the woman's guardianship law the Juul measure has done much to place Illinois on a favorable basis as compared with other progressive states.",
                "Mr. Juul came to Chicago thirty-one years ago, while not in his teens, from Denmark,where he was born. He at once took up the study of law, and was admitted to the bar in 1898. The caliber of his legal mind was soon shown, and he was made assistant attorney for the Sanitary Board, which position he still holds. In 1899 he went in for politics, and was elected to the State Senate on the Republican ticket. He was reelected in 1902, 1904 and again in 1910."

May I ask: what does this mean? Our State's Attorney claims to have sufficient evidence on hand to convict the men. But suppose the four lawyers by their shrewdness and talent succeed in juggling to such an extent that the jury will render a verdict of not guilty. Does that mean that a man at any time can commit murder and go free providing he has the price to buy the talent, or does it mean that justice has been reduced to a piece of merchandise sold to anybody who wants to buy? Does it not tend to encourage lawlessness? If these lawyers succeed in freeing the accused men, our daily press will offer columns of praise and eulogy to the already well-known and honored barristers. The public in general will admire their wonderful achievements, while they themselves way down in their hearts (perhaps) feel that they have helped to defeat justice, but probably the profession makes allowance for all that.",
                "Dear readers, if such things can happen in our courts, what can possibly happen in our legislative bodies where I understand about three hundred lawyers are representing the majority of the American people? Is there not cause for us to stop and think, cause to fill the mind and heart of every justice and liberty-loving true American with fear for the future? Would it not be high time for every loyal American to replace these gentlemen of lesiure with real men; men who would contribute to the maintainance of society, men engaged in constructive work, both mental and material. It would not be necessary for them to know their Wester, or to use more than ordinary words which the common people would understand, as long as they are true representatives of the welfare of the country and the people, men who would interpret the true spirit of our laws and constitution, and not try to buy it in honey combed amendments, but hold the grand old document aloft and let its shining ideal be burned into the heart of every man, woman, and child. Perhaps it would help to settle the unrest and discontent in our land. Perhaps it would drive away the red spectre that is raising its head everywhere, if the causes are removed. Then we could proudly tell the world: \"This is God's country, and fit for industrious, law-abiding, justice and liberty-living people to live in."

For instance, we find that our inventive genius, today far more occupied with life destroying than lifesaving devices.

If no occasion arises, we create an imaginary foe, usually a nation too weak to defend itself. Even worse than the battleship is the dreaded submarine.",

This is not the case, but instead, a few well-directed bombs soon dispel such illusions, and we realize that the plane is used mainly for destruction. Man is indeed smart, so much so that he eventually outwits himself. Not content with building, we destroy, and naturally civilization suffers, and is going on the downgrade. In fact the \"Zeitgeist,\" seems to indicate that our appetite for destruction will cease only after God himself has been dethroned by the ingenuity of man."

It is more difficult to awake the interest of university students. Therefore the special favors.",

There was a time when a person had to defend his home and family arms in hand; but that is not even permissible now.

                "Germany's thinly veiled conquest of Finland, coupled with her apparent designs upon the Scandinavian countries, is a matter of serious concern to the United States and our allies of war. The Aaland Islands, a neutral outpost of Sweden in the northern Baltic, have been occupied by the Germans, and German military forces have been stationed at Aabo, on the coast of southern Finland. No serious resistance was offered to the invaders, who appeared in the garb of helmeted angels of Finland, and the Finnish \"White Guards,\" working hand in glove with them, lost no time in signing a peace agreements as drawn by the Germans and providing for the customary commercial privilege for the benefit of Germany.",
                "Whether the country was seized by force or agreement, whether it is to remain nominally a Republic, or to be blessed with a German made king, is, of course, immaterial. What matters is that Finland, with its coasts and islands and resources, has come under complete German control. The Baltic, including the Gulf of Finland, and the Gulf of Bothnia, is now a German lake. The only Baltic egress to the sea left to Russia under the Bolshevik peace treaty is the channel leading to Kronstadt and Petrograd. This is commanded by guards in German service, and firmly intrenched in the Aaland Islands, in person, or by proxy. Germany controls the commerce of Northern Sweden, with its large exports of lumber and iron ore, which are of pre-eminent importance at this time and in the next War, which, in Germany, is regarded as a matter of course.",
                "Apart from these advantages, Germany will be aided materially in other ways in her conduct of the War by her control of Finland and her resources.",
                "Finnish dairy products will be extremely welcomed in the empire, where butter, cream, and milk have been and still are very scarce. Of much greater importance is the forest wealth of Finland. Vast stores of timber and lumber, which have been accumulating in various parts of the country during the War will now be available, and the German commanders will know how to make effective use of them for trench building and other war purposes.",
                "Another immediate military advantage which Germany will reap as a fruit of her hold upon Russia and Finland is submarine bases on the Artic seas. We do not know the full terms of the peace concluded between Germany and her friends, the Bolsheviki. But from what has leaked out, it appears that the Germans have stipulated for restrictions upon the commerce of Archangel, the Russian port on the White Sea, until general peace is restored. That the Bolsheviki, under the leadership of Lenin, will concede all that the Germans see fit to demand or suggest goes without saying. That means, among other things, that Archangel is to be made a German port and submarine base. The repeated explosions and destruction of war supplies which have occurred at Archangel show that German spies are strongly intrenched there, German U-boats may expect to sneak out from a new base or building here, as soon as the ice in the White Sea hall breaks.",
                "A landing of Allied troops has already been made to prevent the establishment of a more dangerous base for U-boats at Katharine Bay, at the mouth of the Kola River, on the Kola Peninsula. While Archangel is icebound the greater part of the year, Katharine Harbor is open all the year around. It is located at the head of a fine winding fiord some thirty miles long, that cuts into the western part of the Kola Peninsula, about two hundred miles west of its northern point on the white Sea, and twenty-five miles east of the boundary line between Russian Lapland and Norway.",
                "After abandoning or postponing her way to the open Atlantic across Sweden and Norway, Russia, some years ago, set about to build a great ice free harbor and port on territory already hers, at the mouth of the Kola River. The place was distant and almost inaccessible by land, but railroads could be built to it, and plans were made for the construction of a double track road across the peninsula to connect the Kola fiord with the Finnish and Russian railroads.",
                "Katherine Harbor, the name selected for the new city and port, soon became a beehive of activity. Plans were perfected for a great naval establishment, and a commercial city and port along thoroughly modern lines. Real-estate values began to rise and kept advancing to the satisfaction of the most enthusiastic boomers, though comparatively few people in this country were aware of the future possibilities of this new center of sea power and trade on the Arctic.",
                "A great deal of construction work had been done when the war cloud burst upon the world. Work had to be slowed down in consequence of the War, but it did not cease. At least, as late as a couple of years ago, Katharine Harbor was a place of busy bustle, and a short time before the Russian revolution, investments on a large scale were under consideration by well-known American capitalists.",
                "A third base might be rigged up at Bear Island, located about midway between North Cape and Spitzbergen and claimed by Germany. She also claims a slice of the great Arctic \"No Man's Land,\" Spitzbergen, which is not subject to any recognized lawful authority, except such steps as the government of Norway has taken in recent years for the protection and convenience of tourists and other visitors. Russian writers have from time to time been insisting that the whole Spitzbergen Archipelago is a rightful Russian possession by virtue of alleged occupation, but the claim has never been recognized by any power.",
                "An obscure and ambiguous clause of the German-Bolsheviki treaty appears to cede Russia's shadowy rights to Germany, thus providing the Kaiser with some sort of pretext for grabbing all of Spitzbergen, which is known to be rich in coal of fine quality, iron ore, and other minerals. One or more submarine bases in Spitzbergen would complete Germany's chain of Arctic U-boat stations, and enable her to assert her pretended rights to the Archipelago with greater force.",
                "German preparations for a submarine establishment at Archangel cannot be prevented while the Bolsheviki are in power in Russia. All the Allies can do here is to watch for the U-boats when they come out, on their way to the sea, which is likely to be attempted from time to time, before the White Sea is free from ice.",
                "Should Germany succeed in establishing a chain of submarine bases in the Arctic, she would have the Scandinavian countries encircled on three sides: from the south, east, and north. Her army is on their southern flank; by her control of the Baltic Sea and Gulf of Finland, she threatens the entire eastern front of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, and her Arctic naval bases would command their northern flank. Will she attempt to complete the circle at this time? Is she planning to strike at the Scandinavian countries to envelop them in the folds of the empire by conquest, or by a systematic campaign of threats, starvation, and other forms of German ruthlessness?",
                "That Scandinavia ultimately must become German is a fixed article of faith in the Pan-German mind, as much so as has been the idea of a Central Europe ruled by Germany. As a matter of fact, German Scandinavia forms a part of \"Mitteleuropa,\" as it has been conceived by Pan-German writers. Every author of this school who writes in the spirit of the full sweep of \"Weltmacht\" and \"Kultur,\" includes the northern countries in the world empire to be created. A few quotations from well-known writers will serve as typical illustrations of the Pan-German designs upon their neighbors to the North.",
                "Albert Gottlieb, writing in 1914, says in an article discussing Germany's opportunities for conquest: \"Our gaze sweeps wider from the North Cape to the Indian Ocean, embracing an empire that from the geographical, economic, and political points of view, possesses boundless possibilities.\"",
                "It is unnecessary to lengthen the string of quotations. Battalions of Pan-German writers preach the same gospel of grab with persistent monotony. The rights and wishes of the states to be absorbed are not considered in the least. In German national philosophy, small states have no right to exist; nay, a small state affronts a stronger neighbor by the mere fact of existing, at least, if this neighbor happens to be Prussia or Germany. To the Pan-German, it is even the high duty of Germany to absorb neighboring communities in order to bless them with German \"Kultur\".",
                "if a campaign for the absorption of Scandinavia is deemed expedient at this time, it will be undertaken: no restraints of a moral character exist to prevent it. Whether it is advisable or expedient from a German point of view will be determined by the same powers that forced the War upon the world, and have been conducting it so far and will continue to run it: \"Headquarters,\" the great general staff, the essence and directing force of Pan-Germanism in arms. As the world knows, it is the policy of \"Headquarters\" to do a thorough job of it now so as to leave everything in the best possible shape for the next war.",
                "To Germany, control of Scandinavia would offer military advantages of no mean order. To begin with, the Baltic would become permanently a German body of water; with her control of the Baltic provinces of Russia, Finland, and Scandinavia, Germany would own the entire shore line of the Baltic, and command all inlets to it. The mineral resources of Sweden and Norway, including rich iron beds, copper, and other useful minerals, the wealth of their extensive forests, the inexhaustible stores of sea food represented by the fisheries of Norway, the vast water power of Norway and Sweden, with its industrial possibilities, all this would be at the command of Germany."

He points out the accusation of all pro-Germans that Wilson is of English descent, and that at the beginning of the War he declared himself neutral, but did nothing to prevent the states from becoming the main source of ammunition for only one side of the conflict."

They are proud of having contributed in a considerable measure to the agricultural, industrial, and commercial greatness of the United States, the benefits of whose prosperity they have shared. They are anxious to show their gratitude to the land of their adoption, and their complete loyalty to its government by making such sacrifices as may be properly expected at this time from all true patriots. They are willing and eager to offer themselves, according to their qualifications, for military duty, or employment in field and factory, or for other service, with the object of helping as far as they can to uphold your hands in the present crisis. They will cheerfully contribute from their resources in the fullest possible manner to meet the extraordinary financial needs of the government, and in all other ways will earnestly cooperate to maintain the country's honor, and to insure triumph of a cause that is destined to bring about a lasting international peace."

To give the President or Congress such a power may be a necessity, but it is a crime, nevertheless, to commandeer young men into the army, and send them to the front without first giving them a thorough military training.",

It is natural that he should want to show his prowess, and his life and all his life's work seem wasted to him if he has no opportunity of doing some practical service. So there will be a party in the country which wishes for war from noble, unselfish motives. Then there will be another group which wishes the same from sordidly selfish motives, and this group will be very rich, very influential."

Having once fulfilled these conditions, they are eligible at any subsequent date to become \"active\" members, irrespective of their age or state of health at the time of the transfer. It was thought advisable to impose this minimum of general compulsory sickness insurance because experience had proved that in a great many instances people regretted their failure to join a club in time, thereby debarring themselves from the benefits administered by these associations. The new law, therefore, calls for general participation at a low rate of contribution; namely, two crowns per annum for persons up to twenty-five years of age, and thereafter, two and one-half crowns per annum. These small contributions compensate the sick clubs for undertaking the risk of having to accept such persons as \"active\" members at a higher age.",
                "The Danish Crown is currently quoted around twenty-one and one-half cents. Under the provisions of the new law, all active or inactive members of sick benefit clubs are automatically insured against invalidity. The premium collected annually for invalid insurance amounts to six crowns for those who became members of sick benefit clubs before their twenty-first year, and seven crowns for those who became members after their twenty-first year.",
                "The law also provides that the invalid pension, which becomes effective when the total earning capacity for a person is reduced to two-thirds, as well as the Old Age pension, which is granted from the sixty-fifth year, shall be founded upon a basic rate of pensions according to sex, residence, income, and capital.",
                "The following table shows the annual benefit in the form of invalid pensions or Old Age pensions which can be granted under the new law to various categories of persons residing in various localities where the cost of living differs:",
                "The Normal rates are (crowns):",
                "Persons with private incomes exceeding two hundred crowns per annum for married couples, and those with one hundred crowns per annum for single persons, are not entitled to full Old Age pensions. If the income is larger, corresponding deductions are made in the Old Age pension in such a manner that the income plus the reduced amount of Old Age pension never exceeds the maximum Old Age pension.",
                "The number of persons pensioned in the five year period, 1928-1932, averages ninty-nine thousand, and the amount expended amounts to sixty million crowns per annum."

It does not matter, of course, that presumably each and everyone of these were unable to earn much more than one-tenth of the salary Dr. Wirt receives and earns. Naturally, when marshalled into the administration for the purpose of devising new deal ways and means, their recompense underwent a magic rise, but even then it is no more than a fraction of what the lowly Gary pedagogue collects in a free market.",

S. Chamber of Commerce as in all respects a harmful and useless piece of legislation? What about the Wagner bill that would strait jacket employers and create untouchable nonunion labor caste? What about unemployment insurance by was of a new heavy tax upon already overtaxed business? What about the officially endorsed regimentation and socialization of agriculture, industry and finance in general, and particularly in the communication and utility field? And what about the tragic air mail mess, the initial stages of which under ordinary parlimentary rules, would have called for a quick change of administration, but here is stubbornly adhered to and augmented at irreparable loss of life and business?",
                "Mr. Mallon doubts if Dr. Wirt could get any two brain trusters to agree on any method of procedure about anything. Perhaps so just as to methods of procedure, but so far, all the administration brain trusters seem as one in aiming to curb and destroy individual initiative, thrift and the profit motive, in fact everything incompatible with the soc-mill (sic) theory of society, the fulfillment of which means coercive communism."

It is still more so today. To the contrary, although basically in line with the viewpoint of Henry George, a quite different mode of \"single\" taxation is available by way of a uniformly and properly graded surtax on individual income. Referring to the very example presented by N.H. against the sales tax, a surtax applied at say, one per cent on in come between one thousand and two thousand dollars, and one per cent more on each additional thousand dollars income, would answer as follows:",

Prisoners were thrown to the lions (political preferred); it was a heyday, with excitement, interesting spectacles, entertainment. As a result, the people forgot for the time being, anyway, their own troubles. Their attention was distracted from the main issue. Human nature proves true to form. And our leaders, knowing this trick, resort to the same thing. They distract the attention of the people from the vital issue of the day. Our twenty-four million souls reduced to poverty and starvation by the careless mistakes made by the Trinity--Hoover, Wall Street, and our Administration--have their minds taken off their troubles by being given tales of the evils of communism.

For instance, in one case the Court had to decide that the right thing to do was to take three small children, all under school age, away from their parents and home. It is hard to think that a home could be so filthy, so lacking in the neccesary willingness for the raising and care of children, so lacking in affection and responsible feeling for the family, as to force the Court to take these babies away and put them in an institution that they might be provided with the necessities of life. In our everyday life we meet, more or less often, the case of a child who is not coming up to the standard set by his parents. Have you ever thought about how often the parents fall below the standard the child might have made, unconsciously, in his own way? Take for instance the case of a lad of thirteen years of age who is brought to the Court because he runs away from home. The case presents interest immediately because the boy is old enough to reason things out by himself. As the case develops, we find his record at school is of the best and his attendance regular. He sleeps in hallways at night or any other available place and appears at school the following day at the regular time, usually without breakfast. When questioned, he stands up for himself with amazing militancy.",
                "The family consists of his mother, sister, stepfather, and himself. The stepfather's frequent beatings, which made life unbearable to the child, were the cause of his leaving home. The boy revealed his character and his personality so effectively as to sway the judge to his side. He was told to return home to his mother, with the admonition that if he was punished again he could come directly to the court and his stepfather would be sentenced to jail.",

In our different minds, this vision will differ according to the class of people we have at some time or other been in contact with, usually the middle class or the proletarians. A visit to the courts will, I am sure, change this picture in the minds of most of you. When people come to this country, assume its citizenship, customs, and laws, they become part of this country and cease to be considered \"foreigners.\" It is the people who refuse to do without the language, customs, and laws of their homeland and who live as though they were still there, that truly deserve the title of \"foreigners.\"",

Miss Ransdall spent considerable time in Alabama interviewing the girls involved in the case, Judge Hawkins, and other officials and citizens in Scottsboro.",
                "The report is a merciless indictment of justice as meted out to Negroes by the white ruling class in the South, condemning the Scottsboro case as a farce. The report states: \"They all wanted the Negroes put to death as quickly as possible in a way that would bring disrepute upon the town. They therefore preferred a sentence of death by a judge to a sentence by the mob, but they desired the same result, and were impatient with anything that slowed up the conviction and death sentence which they all knew was coming regardless of any testimony.\"",
                "The report in its detailed analysis of the facts involved in the case, and the economic status of the hegro in the South, continues; as one Southerner in Scottsboro put it, \"We white people just couldn't afford to let these 'niggers' go free because of the effect it would have on other 'niggers.'\"",
                "The report concludes: \"The trial, such as it was, is over. Interest and passion in the case have cooled. Examining the present status of the accusers and the accused, to see what horrible things have been brought about by this crime, heralded in the Alabama papers as the most heinous ever committed in the state, or the whole country, as a matter of fact, this is what one finds:",

They both told me with great satisfaction that their pictures had been taken and put in the papers, that writers have been after their stories, that they had received money from various sources because of the case.",

                "A wide divergence between the old school of Marxism and contemporary socialism is strikingly illuminated by comparing the two outstanding leaders; the venerable departed fundamentalist, Eugene U. Debs, who proudly went to jail for a visionary cause, and his successor, the party's standard bearer, Norman Thomas, who typifies a bewildered mixture of professedly individualistic yearnings and efforts to destroy or at least impair the economic social structure shaped by individualism.",

Wars and preparations, armaments, and tariffs, displaced gold reserves, and other frequently cited causes are in no more than minor ways contributary to the paralysis created by accumulated and inherited wealth, the most definite manifestation of which are an imposing leisure and luxury class sponging upon other people's labor.",

The communistic level of existance, which may suffice for simpletons never used to anything better, looms rather repellent to people of more advanced views and requirements; both material and spiritual, and so it is up to the rest of the world to mend its way and demonstrate that freedom, opportunity and economic justice are realizable under a true and healthy consistent individualism, a system free from all species of unfair privileges, subsidies, bounties and artificial inequalities. It is almost certain that the alternative is moral and economic bankruptcy, the process of decay from within the system itself being accelerated by an eager army of socialists, radicals, liberals, progressives, and other confused but well-meaning propagandists and reformers with an abundance of experimental socialization, paternalism, bureaucracy, government subsidization or restriction of business, the pouring out of doles and soaring taxes which contribute to the creation of the vicious circle of distress and distemper wherein bolshevism may thrive.",

Why not try this simple and straight way to safer and saner human relations."

At the recent conference of state executives, Governor Franklin Roosevelt of New York came out in favor of unemployment insurance to be provided through contributions from employers, employees, and the public treasury.",
                "A few years ago, this would have been considered a radical idea in the United States. Such suggestions were termed socialistic. Just why that term was employed is not precisely clear since unemployment insurance was first developed in Germany during the days of Bismarck, and in Great Britain in the days of Lloyd George, both arch enemies of organized socialism. A sound movement cannot, however, be stopped by an epithet, and it is fairly certain that at no very distant day unemployment insurance will be firmly established in this country. Already, pioneer experiments have been made in a few industries and by a few far sighted corporations\".",

State socialism was exactly what Bismarck propagated in Germany with unemployment insurance and other measures intended to parry the offerings of Bebel and company, and what Lloyd George (for the present, by the way, succoring the so-called arch enemy) has helped along in Britain. This ought to make it precisely clear why unemployment insurance in the United States, if partly or wholly financed by the public treasury, is rightfully termed \"socialistic\", as are other paternalistic blessings which we have already or may expect to have if the liberals who are most liberal with the taxpayer's money shall have their way.",
                "That already pioneer experiments have been made in a few industries and a few farsighted corporations, is fully true, and commendable, but such steps have been accomplished without raids on the public treasury, and so has every other kind of insurance enumerated by our national weekly as arguments for unemployment dole!"

                "\"It has been the practice of governments to graduate the income tax: the federal government does; all the states imposing such a tax do; this state does in its inheritance tax. The graduation here is very conservative. It is justified by the principle that such a tax may be imposed in such a way and at such varied rates as, within reason, to cause the least amount of hardship. One who has an income of ten thousand dollars can pay a tax of three hundred dollars more easily than can one who has an income of one thousand dollars pay a tax of ten dollars. Usually the former would simply have the amount of his surplus reduced, while the latter may be deprived of the necessities of life.\"",

The former would still have ninety-one thousand dollars for living expenses and investment, while the latter will have only nine thousand seven hundred dollars.",
                "However, such a progressive tax, when carried out to the extreme, would, at times, reach one hundred per cent of a persons income, and would thus become so manifestly absurd and unjust to persons with large incomes that its adoption would be out of the question.",
                "But the problem could be justly and equitably solved with a surtax of a fraction of one per cent on each one thousand dollars of an income over a certain tax-exempt limit. If this limit is set at three thousand dollars, and the surtax on each additional thousand is fixed at one-fourth of one per cent, according to simple differential calculus, it would be as follows: $4,000, at \u00bc%, $2.50; $5,000, at \u00bd%, $7.50; $6,000 at 3/4%, $15; $7,000, at 1%, $25; $8,000, at 1\u00bc%, $37.50; and $403,000, at 100%, $200,500.",
                "If the tax on an income of $403,000 was $200,500, this would leave the taxpayer $202,500 net, and since the surtax had reached 100%, no larger amount could be retained by any taxpayer.",
                "If found reasonable, the surtax might be reduced to, say, one-eighth of one per-cent, in which case the 100% tax would be reached on an income of $803,000, making the tax-total $400,500, and leaving the taxpayer $402,500. Of course, all tax-exempt securities should be taxed in order to allow such a tax measure to work equitably.",

In the first place, this tax would check the accumulation of enormous fortunes and the growth of the leisure class, now sponging upon, and always craving a huge tribute from, the workers and producers in the city and country. Not handicapping an individual's initiative or enterprise--at least not up to the point now reached by only very few people--such a tax would save the best features of the present system, and might be destined to establish the golden rule between rampant capitalism and visionary schemes of socialism and communism now nursed by many people having but little understanding of either economics or human nature.",
                "By adopting the one hundred per cent surtax, as would be proper, the national government might distribute part of the proceeds, proportionately, to the respective states and municipalities, so that very few, if any, local taxes would be necessary.",

To be sure, not every dollar is properly invested and many fortunes are squandered, but, in the main, the system tends to create enormous fortunes and a class of people who, as bond holders and shareholders, exact a certain evergrowing tribute from the real workers and producers in city and country.",
                "The farmer not only pays interest on the actual mortgage on his farm, but also, indirectly, pays part of the dividends to holders of securities in transportation companies, mills, warehouses, and industries that supply all his necessities. The workingman pays interest on his mortgaged house, or if a tenant, pays rent to the landlord, besides helping to pay interest on dividends on capital invested in his employer's business, as well as in commerce generally; so does every other home-owner and consumer. In other words, capital exacts a certain return from all useful activity and production, and part of this tribute is reinvested and exacts new tribute.",
                "In this manner the civilized world is gradually becoming so encumbered with debt to capital internationally, nationally, and individually that finally a situation will be reached, as we are now witnessing in Europe, where the apparent economic breakdown is considered the underlying cause the late War, rather than its consequence. If this were not so, the War's economic damage could have been repaired in less time than the Peace Conference lasted. Young America, with its still enormous natural resources, may be a long way from the European abyss, but it is undoubtedly traveling in that direction and will travel faster, the worse conditions become in Europe, even if we do have spasmodic periods of relative prosperity.",
                "The one reform needed is a measure that will benefit all workers and every useful effort by restricting the tribute to capital, without, however, abolishing capital's fundamental position or hindering private initiative or enterprise. Such a measure is the surtax graduate to one hundred per cent, which would prevent the accumulation of colossal fortunes and check the growth of the non-producing leisure class by returning part of capital's present huge income to the public treasuries for the benefit of society in general.",
                "As capitalism obviously has become top-heavy, every country shows a more or less clearly defined tendency, which the great War has prevented, to enforce a wider distribution of wealth through, either a limited graduated income tax, or the still more efficient surtax."

He has recently discovered in a Paris library a book by a French traveler who visited the colonies in 1765. By quoting from this book, Dr. Jameson endeavors to destroy the historical fact that Patrick Henry delivered a patriotic speech in the Virginia House of Burgesses in 1765, which was the real beginning of the American opposition against George III, at least in a public way.",

Henry faltered not an instant, but rising to a loftier attitude and fixing on the Speaker an eye of the most determined fire, he finished his sentence with the firmest emphasis, 'may profit by their example. If this be treason, make the most of it.' \"",
                "What the French traveler, whose name does not appear in his book, and whom nobody knows, says, we shall not quote in extenso, but the gist of it is that Henry almost went down on his knees and begged the Speaker and the House to forgive him for the unwarranted expression, and that he vehemently affirmed his allegiance to George III. It is more important to quote The Advocate of Peace, a Washington paper, which is endowed with funds from the Carnegie Institution. In bringing the discovery before its readers, it writes the following introduction:",

If this be treason, make the most of it,' but something quite to the contrary. Indeed, he is now pictured as asking pardon on that occasion for mentioning Caesar and Charles I in connection with George III. The document just brought to light, which reveals Henry as most loyal to His Majesty George III, has all the appearance of a discovery of real importance.",
                "\"It will be something of a sad blow for the many who have been brought up under the glow of that alleged defiance, but the new evidence is very convincing. It now looks as if we must expunge that oft-quoted speech from our history, and eliminate at least the climax of it from our erstwhile patriotic prepossessions.\"",

Every nation has its lore, if its ancestry reaches back into the gray mist of antiquity. But we are a young nation, and history on American soil only dates back to the beginning of the seventeenth century. Our history is, therefore, clear to everybody except propagandists.",
                "The travelers of the eighteenth century were, as a rule, very inaccurate in their statements. And there is no sound reason why an anonymous French writer should be accorded the preference to William Wirt, who was an American historian of repute and trustworthiness. Even in our day, European travelers race through our country and divert their own countrymen with narratives that teem with falsehoods. And probably that French writer did not even know English enough to understand intelligently what he heard.",
                "It is true William Wirt was not present in the House of Burgesses when Henry delivered his ever-memorable speech, but he names sources, such as the eminent John Tyler, Thomas Jefferson, and Paul Carrington. We know nothing about the unnamed French author, but we do know the three great patriots who were all present.",
                "And other good evidence is Henry himself. The whole speech is in most intimate accord with his fiery nature. But it is not only Patrick Henry, but every patriot of the American Revolution and the Revolution itself, that some Americans wish to discredit in order to exonerate English from all wrongdoing.",
                "It is disgusting to see native Americans enlisted in such an unworthy cause. We Americans of foreign birth, however, will always be ready to support the United States, the American nation, the American Constitution, and our sacred traditions, regardless of what others may do, but there is sufficient reason to ask: Whither are we drifting?"

Rodriguez of the strongly Scandinavian 15th ward, where, at the last election, William E. Cunnea received twice as many votes as any of the opposing candidates.

                "The hog raisers of Middlesex County, who last year were paid three hundred and sixty-five dollars [each] for cutting hog production, have voted unanimously to accept the government bounty in 1956.",
                "Naturally they would. Many of them in this way have received small fortunes in the past two years, besides profiting immensely from the great rise in hog prices. The public is paying high taxes to make these men comparatively rich.",
                "The Massachusetts hog farmers get the cream from this hog-control scheme. The hogs they raise are small but they get as much money for not raising an eighty-pound hog as western hog farmers get for a two-hundred-and-fifty or three-hundred-pound hog.",
                "Western farmers raise corn-fed hogs. The higher the price of corn, the more it costs them to raise a hog. But our local hogs are garbage-fed hogs. Few of them see any corn. The stuff fed to them costs the hog farmer no more than the cost of transportation. Yet, the raiser of garbage-fed hogs gets as much for his hogs in the market as the raiser of corn-fed hogs.",
                "This year the price of hogs soared to three times the price the hog farmer received in 1934. So did the bounties he received, for he got three times as much for every hog not raised in 1935 as he did in 1934.",
                "We are facing the greatest hog scarcity in fifty years. As all housewives know, the price of park products is rising tremendously. It will be impossible for the hog raiser here to supply the demand in the coming year, and the supply must be augmented by importations from abroad. The Bureau of Agricultural Economics, in Washington, declares that prices for pork products are likely to go very much higher this winter.",
                "In view of all this, the idea of continuing to force production cuts for 1936, and paying out huge sums to hog farmers, who will probably make twice as much money next year as this year, seems fantastic.",
                "When one hog farmer, here, who is an alien, can get a twenty-thousand-dollar bonus in 1934, a nine-thousand-dollar bonus in 1935, and a probable nine-thousand-dollar one in 1956 for a farm worth not more than seven thousand dollars--and in addition make the biggest profit in all his farming history--the ordinary farmer here who gets no bonuses, and sometimes is forced to sell produce at a loss, must be amazed at such windfalls for hog farmers.",
                "And the housewife is paying for all this. Could there be a more absurd situation than housewives paying processing taxes in order to increase the cost of the food they buy? Even when costs rise so high that consumers are protesting forcibly the order goes forth from Washington to jack them up a good deal higher.",

                "Sign up with the government not to raise, say, five hundred hogs. It will pay you one thousand dollars. That will pay for the farm and you will still have some money left.\""

                "\"Parley Parker Christensen, of the Farmer-Labor Party, agrees with Mr. Brookhart. So do many others who write articles for magazines. If these persons are right, if the habits and success of Danish farmers really could be transplanted and made universal in America, one of the-greatest problems of this nation's business would be solved offhand. Are these things possible?",
                "The question is worth-while, because Denmark in her way has done wonders in farming, and this country's agricultural wonders are still to come. It is worth-while also because, if we cannot do what Denmark has done, it is important to know the fact at once. Then we shall not waste valuable time on hopeless experiments.",
                "What Has Denmark Done",
                "Denmark has done wonders, that is true. Sixty years ago she was a conquered, little country with poor land and an unprosperous population. She had bog and sand in abundance; she had big estates only half cultivated; she had a fierce and half-sunless climate. Much of her soil had been cultivated for a thousand years. She had apparently a worn-out proposition in her agriculture. Yet by the co-operation of her farmers among themselves, by the division of her big estates up to the point where thirty acres are today the average sized farm, and by the combined efforts of government, bankers, and farmers she has become more or less of a marvel in farm prosperity to the larger countries of the worlds. She even supplies great quantities of food to Great Britain, a country eight times her size and fourteen times her population.",
                "If the United States, in proportion to its size and population, could do what Denmark has done, we would soon be feeding the world. But it is probably because of its size and population that the United States never will be able to use the Brookhart remedy.",
                "The Population of Chicago",
                "All Denmark has just about the population of Chicago. All Denmark is just about one-quarter the size of Illinois, one-third the size of New York, one-tenth the size of California. The vast variety of farms, farm produce, and farmers that extend from the granite hills of New Hampshire to the tropical fields of the Imperial Valley are unknown to the tiny kingdom of the Danes.",
                "If a man wishes to realize the difference in the problems of the two countries, he has only to imagine the ranches of the Great West cut up into thirty, forty, or fifty acre farms of clustering co-operatives, and try to visualize the plight of the new-era farmers. Want and hardships would be the common lot. The desert hermits would be no more unfortunate. In fact, upon hundreds of thousands of acres the farmers would no longer be farmers, but they themselves would be desert hermits.",
                "If the United States could be drained wherever it is wet and be irrigated wherever it is dry; if its one hundred and seven million people could be governed from one city hall as are the three million (?) in Chicago; if their climate, products, and habits could be made uniform as are those of Long Island, or Cook, or Ventura County; if figuratively, they all could be fitted with the Game clothes at the same season of the year and be content, then the thingswould be possible in this country that are possible in little Denmark. Otherwise not.",
                "Limits of Co-operation",
                "That in lands like England, Italy, and France the Danish example has not been followed is fair evidence that it cannot be applied to other countries of their sizes. If these countries could do on a large scale, what Denmark has done on her small scale, they would make the effort soon enough for they all are keen for their own prosperity.",
                "Yet even in England, where the distress of the farmers is much worse than in our own Northwest, it is agreed that the Danish example can be followed to only a limited extent. The orange growers of one state or two may cooperate, as well as the cheesemakers and dairymen of others, the wheat growers or tobacco growers of still others, but to spread a uniform network of general co-operation and state supervision over all food production from Maine to Southern California, in Danish style, would be the colossal experiment of all ages and peoples, outside Russia.",
                "If such an experiment were to be tried, its success would be a matter of decades. Even in tiny Denmark, the present success is the achievement of nearly two generations. Therefore, as a means of relieving the American farmers, it would be no remedy at all in this year 1923, or in any of the ten years to come.",
                "The day of miracles is not at hand for the farmers, any more than for the rest of us in business.\"",
                "So Mr. Hinman seems to come to the conclusion that it would not work. And yet, trying surely could not do much harm, if any.",
                "The secrets of success for the agriculture of Denmark are:",
                "1) Cooperation-unity. The farmers help themselves by helping one another. They have carried that idea out in all their agricultural unions. Furthermore, the movement has spread to the towns, where almost everywhere you find co-operative stores. When the Danish farmers buy foreign materials for their farms, for the benefit of their cattle or their fields, they get their goods at home through the purchases of their co-operative unions.",
                "Of course, the wares can be procured cheaper that way than if each farmer had to buy just for his own use.",
                "2) Knowledge of agricultural theory. Farming in Denmark is not considered a job for those who are good for nothing else. Instruction is given in several agricultural schools scattered throughout the country. For many years there has been a special royal academy of agriculture in Copenhagen, whose teachers are the leading scientists in their line.",
                "3) Energy. Energy is necessary for the Danish farmer. Money has never been easily earned by the one who must depend upon the weather as much as upon the quality of his soil and his machinery. His personal efforts mean the most. But energy at least should not be considered any obstacle in the United States.",
                "The main objection of Mr. Hinman is that co-operation would necessarily be limited if the Danish system was tried in the States. Evidently he is of the opinion that the necessary unity in aim could not be accomplished here. Yet the entire world is the same in this respect. If a man is unwilling to join a new scheme to help his fellow beings, generally he will join, when he is convinced that he can profit by it. Would the Danish system work in the States? Yes, it would work anywhere when done right, but of course it would not improve matters at once. Little Denmark, small as she is, possesses a few good things which she can teach the rest of the world. More and more, countries are realizing this and are asking Denmark for advice. Many Danish dairy people have gone to New Zealand and Australia. And this very summer, on the request of the Japanese government, some of the best Danish farmers have been chosen by the Danish government and have been sent to Japan to establish and supervise Danish model farms in that country."

                "Max Henius had the good fortune of being well-born. His parents came from Northern Germany, that part of the world where agriculture and industry flourished in the beginning of the nineteenth century, where modern chemistry was born, and the life of the people followed happy and constructive historical lines. His parents settled in Denmark, in the town of Aalborg. They worked hard to achieve great success. An old town sheltered the childhood of Jacob Riis; so did another old town surround the growth of Max Henius. An old town, a small town, where life is a unit, based on fine traditions and old ideals, which is a blessing to a child and youth. Our friend, Dr. Henius, absorbed these traditions and ideals. He was well named--a brief, open, and clear name, easy to call. He grew up close to the sea, on one side, and to ancient moorlands on the other. There was heatherbloom in his mind and ancient hills in his fancies,--that was the land of the valient Kimbrie tribes; and its saga became part of Max Henius' life, the background of his poetry, his vision.",
                "He left this homeland in his fiery youth, and we may emphasize the fact that the was indeed well-born. According to Danish views, that is a consolation, but still secondary to being well reared. Reared as he was in the free life at two German universities, just about the time when bacteriology began, chemistry took shape, and a realistic philosophy developed. Some view the world through poetry and history, others through science and philosophy. Max Henius had both views. Nowadays you call that humanism. He had a happy youth. He practised its lessons as a man. This is the reason why he never grew old in mind or spirit.",
                "I met him in May, 1892, when he had only recently emigrated, and had begun his work in practical chemistry here in Chicago. Then, as ever, there was about his person an air of energy and speed. There was fire and will power in his eye. He was a handsome man, quick and ready, and devoted to the biological teachings of Emil Christian Hansen, who had been my own teacher. Those were the early summer days of a life in which he met with success and gained the courage that upheld him ever.",
                "He had married well, which, according to Danish views, is the third greatest necessity in life. He had married a bright blond daughter of the Heiberg family, and thus became brother-in-law of one of the most famous scientists of the past generation. We both lived to help in raising a monument in honor of Hansen in the old town of Ribe, Denmark.",
                "Henius was not a man that would shake hands, and say he was glad to meet you, then go on and forget all about it. He had finely developed sympathies, and he valued and grasped the subtle and seemingly small things in life. He was mentally incorruptible, as much an analyst in his sympathies as he was in his science. He might be--and was-- fond of his friends, but he loved truth still better. They found him so in Denmark when he began his forty years of continuous voyaging across the Ocean.",
                "It is considered dangerous to lead a double life. Yet, in a sense, this must be the fate of all emigrants. Their memories point one way, their work another. But to Henius the world did not revolve about Chicago, on one side, and about Denmark on the other. There always was a bridge across the Atlantic.",
                "His mind was singularly creative. In a few minutes he could analyze a plan and indicate a course of action, but when this had been done, he wanted action--and was, himself, ready for action. As time passed, and he gained experience, he became a capable administrator on generous lines. And yet he wanted to see both ideals, the method and the detail,--and to have a hand in all.",
                "His voyages and travels, his many occupations and the public matters that enlisted his activities, made of the scientist a grand seigneur, who seemed to dictate and domineer. But Henius was dominant rather than domineering. He preferred to plan and work rather than dictate. Still, you had to know him at close range to comprehend the modesty he possessed. Among us who are have today, there are some whom he put ahead of himself on many occasions.",
                "His talents were varied, and they often made him the center of a circle where he would have preferred to step aside. In his summer home up in the heatherclad hills of Jutland, he Droved himself a wise manager and a generous host. On one occasion, he would entertain the King or the Prime Minister, and their suites in his four little rooms, and the next day, he might put on wooden shoes, take a cane in his hand, and walk about the country, talking with the peasants, the housemen, the woodcutters. His sense of humanity was remarkable, his reaction to persons and ideas quick and most winning. President of the Public Library Board in Chicago, Honorary President of Rebild Park and of the American Library in Denmark--I still am with him on our walks in the heather, in wooden shoes and old hats, talking in the Jutlandish dialect. \"No skal a bigot sej Oe hwa a tinkt oi awtes.\"--(Now I will tell you what I thought about last evening).--No wonder that Mr. Gladstone liked to fell trees and doted on his old hats. He and Henius had much in common. The secret of their lives is partly that they had great ideals, had learned a method of doing things, and chose enlightenment rather than knowledge.",
                "It would be a Danish discovery if one ever knew what he did not first love. Dr. Henius may not have been a giant among chemists, but he loved to be the head of a model and incorruptible chemical laboratory,--and knew how. Nor did he know botanical geography, but he loved and preserved the heather country, and was one of its population. Nor did he know many books, but he sensed the idea of a well-conducted public library for the enlightenment of the people.",
                "Modest and generous, he accomplished great things through the help of others. There was about him a singular old-fashioned courtliness and festivity. Of course, he grew wise as he grew older, but at heart he remained a big child, and like all children, he accepted mankind for what it could contribute. Alone, he was very good company for himself--always dreaming, restlessly forecasting, and sometimes very impatient about sloth, slowness and indifference.",
                "His energy, his sustained friendliness, his memory of kindness, his will-power, his persuasive and sustained idealism, his respect for persons, and yet his independence of them,--all this was part of his portrait as it stands before me. And so, having mentioned birth, upbringing, and marriage, we come to the last step in the four stages of life. \"Well dead is all that matters.\" This is the last line of Ambrosius Stub's verse on the cycle of life.",
                "It is not his death, however, that brings us together here. It is the fact that he lived in such a way when he reached old age, the love, which he gave so generously by work, speech, and example, comes back abundantly from the many friends he served. Happily, he felt its return while still with us. He did not mind being alone, but he never liked loneliness. No bright child can endure it. It was not fear. Nobody was more fearless than Max Henius. He hated to see fear in others. He resented it wherever he saw it, in home or office. Nor need anybody fear him, unless they had been up to some knavery.",
                "I think Henius was a happy man, because he made others happy. He was bouyant and cheerful, always original, always himself. Dull moments he did not know. We all, or most of us, remember him with deep affection in many moods and states of mind, earnest, joyful, impatient, or angry. If he could speak now, he would ask me to mention some instance in which he failed. I would be glad to accommodate him. He failed completely when he tried to be sly or hide his feelings. Then he was funny.",
                "I wish to point out that he took life as he found it. In many ways he won his point over fate. We were together when my dear friend, Young E. Allison's death was announced by telegram. I mentioned one of Allison's sayings: \"Life is great--all of it.\" It was early morning, and the skylarks warbled above us. \"No,\" said Henius, \"to me, not all of it. It ought not come to an end.\"",
                "Let us take leave of him at this point. He regarded the Church as the greatest cultural factor among us, and this remains true. There is no more we can say except that Max Henius forms a separate chapter in the life of every person who had his friendship and was his friend. Thus far, there is no end, memory and love endure. God bless Max Henius, his name, his memory, his work,--his children!"

To it is largely due the phenomenal development of industry, which in turn demands an expansion of scientific research. In this pursuit, science also recognizes those who pursue what is called pure science.",
                "While fully appreciating the mind devoted to research for the sake of knowledge only, and indeed with proper reverence for that kind of work, it was left to him to take the findings of scientific research and apply them to the practical problem of the Brewing industry, thereby leading pure science to the forefront.",
                "Through years of labor in helping the brewers to understand the why and wherefore of manufacturing operations, and placing prevailing operations on a firm scientific foundation, his inquiring mind saw many ways in which the prevailing practices, largely derived from centuries of rule-of-thumb operations, could be simplified and improved so as to lead to greater efficiency of operation, richer yields, better quality of the products, or the industry, and heightened stability of such products. He advised new methods of manufacturing beer whereby the materials at hand were more thoroughly exhausted and waste was curtailed, uniformity of the product assured, quality raised to that pitch which would give beer those properties which would entitle it to the position of the most popular beverage, at the same time guarding the health of the public. The methods he devised would shorten the time required for production--to prevent spoilage with its losses to the manufacturer and the potential injury to the consumer.",
                "One of the conspicuous qualities of Dr. Henius was his gracious personality. He carried this quality not only into his intercourse with the brewery owners and the operators, whose technical advisor he became, but also, and perhaps to a more effective degree, into his teaching of those who attended the Brewing Institute of which he was one of the founders. His students admired his brilliant mind, the clarity of his teaching, and the personal interest he showed in their advancement. The many graduates of the Institute, scattered as they are in all parts of the United States, cherish the memory of their school days not only with admiration, but with pride and affection.",
                "Dr. Henius was a leading figure in the rational movement for temperance. He believed with the backing of eminent men in science and sociology that the best way to promote habits of temperance in the use of alcoholic beverages was to promote the use of beer as against the strong spirituous liquors. On this subjects, he delivered addresses, and published several pamphlets which I believe, had much to do with bringing about the recognition by Congress and State legislative bodies of legal alcoholic beer as a non-intoxicating beverage, and giving it a preferred place in legislation for the taxation and regulation of the business for the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages."

He introduced scientifically conducted autopsies in Chicago, where a bronze tablet in the County Hospital commemorates his fifteen years as chief pathologist there. Not a fluent speaker, nor a brilliant surgeon, yet because of his knowledge, his clinic was the mecca of all aspiring surgeons; a teacher for the love of teaching; free from envy or jealousy, so honest that he reported his first six hysterectomies for cancer of the uterus as dying from the operation; one of the first in America to remove gravel from the common bile duct; perfected operations for tuberculosis of the joints and glands and for cancer of the stomach and uterus. His contribution to surgery of the kidney was presented at the International Congress in Paris in 1900. Decorated by the King of Denmark. The profession of the West demonstrated their love and admiration by a testimonial banquet attended by hundreds of the leading surgeons of America."

                "\"All's well that ends well\" is an old phrase applicable to humans and human destinies also. It expresses a summing up of changeable circumstances and obstacles that have been conquered for the benefit of harmony and contentment. We are thinking of Chief Librarian J. Charles Bay, who recently has been appointed knight of the Danish Flag which appointment has been received with approval by the public over here as well as in Denmark. His official distinction, of course, is only a part of the visible evidence of achievements by a man of sincere purpose, achievements which are significant also to the Danes.",
                "Mr. Bay is a man of wide experience. His fields of activity varied before he found his right place as a librarian, first in the Library of Congress, later as Chief Librarian of the John Crerar Library of Chicago where he has made extensive use of his wide scientific knowledge.",
                "Coinciding with the Danes' conception of titular councillors and \"real\" titular councillors, we have in America librarians and \"real\" librarians, the former knowing the mechanical part of library science, the letter possessing, in addition, a deep understanding of books and their present and future values.",
                "They possess a keen sense of judgment and know instantly what a book contains when scanning over its pages. Bay is of the \"real\" kind. He has a biblophilist's ability to make books serve him as though they were human beings.",
                "The John Crerar Library has a great collection of Danish scientific literature. To be sure this library would have had a great number of Danish works whether or not Mr. Bay had been there, but the fact that Denmark is so well represented must be ascribed to the efforts he has made to that effect. In addition it is due to Charles Bay's efforts that original volumes of Saxo, Flora Danica and other famous Danish works are to be found in other libraries in this country.",
                "He is a man who never forgets to call your attention to the great works produced by Danish authors. Neither does he ever forget that he is Danish and hails from Rudkobing. He is ever true to his origin and cherishes the memory of the little house on the side-street where he was born. Its inhabitants were common, ordinary people, who nevertheless possessed a high degree of culture - only it was minus the academic varnish. No wonder J. Charles Bay is a great friend of Evald Fang Christensen famous for his collection of Danish folk lore, and the author Jeppe Aakjeer as well as of Mr. Feilberg, with whom he corresponds regularly.",
                "If we consider \"the experience of being conscious of one's self on the basis of historical assumptions,\" as being a correct definition of culture, Charles Bay is a man of culture. I remember how impressed I was when he told me of his visit to Denmark last summer, how he had been standing in the portal of the Ribe Cathedral re-living the arrival of Queen Dagmar, how he saw, as in a vision, the golden masted ship unfold its silky sails while slowly proceeding up the Ribe River, and how he heard Valdemar the Victorious and his young bride pass through the self-same portal on their way to the high altar.",
                "An experience of that sort is possible only for a genuine Dane and a man of culture. Mr. Bay speaks Danish with preference and does it with a remarkable degree of perfection.",
                "Mr. Bay's intellectual contribution to the bridge building between Danish and American culture is unquestionable. His many translations of Scandinavian literature to English and as many visa versa are sufficient evidence; particularly his translations of Danish hymns and poetry are made with great skill and understanding. The University of Copenhagen and the Royal Library both have received a great deal of additional literature, American and Danish, through the efforts of Charles Bay. He is widely known in Danish library circles.",
                "His historical interests have led him to intensive study of the history of the Middle West, the Mississippi and Ohio Valleys in particular. He is regarded as an authority on this subject, known and appreciated among Americans, and numerous are the works to which Charles Bay has furnished the introductory chapter; he himself is the author of many historical works. As the years go by, Charles Bay seems to work harder and harder. Far into the night you'll see the light in his study where a valuable collection of literary gems is housed, and where the picture of his mother has its place on the among the pictures of famous personalities.",
                "A few words do often express a world of truth. For instance, when Charles Bay told me of the honorary decoration he had received he added: \"I would rather give it to my wife.\" Such a statement reveals as in a flash what sort of character you are dealing with. Charles Bay could hardly have paid a finer compliment to his wife, and it reflects instantly on himself.",
                "Faithful to his origin, to his adopted country, and his home, are fundamental aspects of Librarian J. Charles Bay's character. When, in addition, he has preserved his genuine Danish view of life, the honor conferred on him must be said to be well deserved. Of those who left Denmark and never returned, J. Charles Bay is a worthy representative.",

Because of this unwelcome fact, the Scandinavian Medical Society of Chicago, finds itself in duty bound once more publicly to express the appreciation, on the part of its members, of those newspapers that keep their columns free from fraudulent medical advertisements and endeavor conscientiously, as best they can, to lessen the evil effects of humbug and quackery in every form.",
                "The Society also takes this occasion again to inform the public of the fact that advertised medicines do not possess the wonderful virtues claimed for them. Deception and fraud are their special characteristics and their main sources of existence. Many of the most widely advertised preparations have been found to contain alcohol and other habit-forming drugs, in spite of claims to the contrary.",
                "It is, however, upon a solemn warning directed to parents and the friends of youth and innocence against the so-called \"advertisement for men\" that particular stress is put at this time for the reason given below. The chief subject of this, the blackest of all frauds, is not to cure a disease but for the purposes of systematic and relentless extortion to create, and maintain a condition of morbid fearfulness, amounting often to actual disease, the unfortunate and pitiful victims of which we physicians know only too well, because we see them so frequently. Newspapers carrying advertisements of the \"for men\" class should be excluded from the home, and prevented from contaminating our youth conscientiously as if they carried contagious diseases.",
                "As stated, advertisements of this kind at present appear in many Scanding vian-American newspapers the publishers of which, contrary to the dictates of conscience, thereby, voluntarily promote the sacrifice of human health in the interest of a traffic so low and so degarding that, lock at it as we may, to be associated therewith now means loss of respect and good opinion among fellow men.",
                "The war upon the harmful medical advertisements must be continued with sustained and increasing vigor. Recognizing fully the peculiar responsibility of physicians in the matter, the Scandinavian-American Medical Society calls on its members as individuals to consider the important question, how each within his own sphere may render the most effective service in this cause; and as an organized body the Society will maintain a permanent committee on \"Fraudulent Medical Advertisements\" whose duty it shall be to collect and disseminate material for the information and instruction of the public; to cooperate and advise with others and to use all legitimate and proper means within its power to stop the humbug and quackery that prey upon the people.",

                "\"The Scandinavian Medical Society has repeatedly discussed at its meetings the possibility of how to stop a disgraceful practice of which, we regretfully admit, nearly all Scandinavian papers over here have taken advantage - namely that of inserting misleading advertisements paid for by quacks and crooks thus spreading false propaganda among an unsuspecting public by promising to restore health, though these charlatans know in advance that they are unable to do so. As a rule the quack will appeal very strongly to sick persons coming to him in response to the ad, urging them to use this or that particular remedy which he sells and which, so he maintains will not fail to have the desired effect. He will extend his appeal to the friends of the unfortunate patient to take up a collection for his benefit. They will contribute in good faith and with confidence in the integrity of their paper. The whole scheme is sheer humbug, sponsored not alone through advertising, but through recommendations with more or less editorial backing. The papers think they can afford such practice because these advertisements pay much higher rates than others. It is therefore extremely difficult to stop this illegal traffic. Through all these years there has been in existence a virtual conspiracy between these swindlers and the papers, a deliberate attempt to exploit an unsuspecting public through false and misleading advertising. Partly as an organization and also through its individual members the Scandinavian Medical Society has approached several papers in order to try to induce them to put an end to this nuisance; but it has been all in rain because in many instances the papers actually depend upon these swindlers for existence. Editors claim they are not responsible for what is being advertised, which attitude leaves the public exposed to a well organized system of exploitation. The whole matter is a black mark against the Scandinavian press and against the integrity of people who lay claim to the honor of being regarded as respectable citizens of our community.\"",
                "Continues Dr. Hektoen: \"Ever since that time nothing has happened that can serve to change my opinion as to the damaging effect of such advertising. At that time we were not aware of how great an amount of alcohol these \"famous remedies\" contained; otherwise we would have called attention to that danger also. In my opinion the most important point in the resolution should have been to condemn one particular type of these advertisements, namely those that appeal especially to men and have caused young men unnesessary suffering and loss of money. It would be a blessing for the young generation if parents would prevent papers carrying that kind of advertisements from entering their homes. For one thing they deal with abhorrent subjects which respectable people do not want their children to be interested in, furthermore, these subjects are presented in such debauching language as is commonly used by \"specialists for men.\" And yet it is the \"family paper,\" which oftentimes brings that kind of literature into the homes. When young men read the deliberately misleading ads edited by the infamous specialists for men they begin to brood over imaginary diseases and, on order to get relief, they will sooner or later consult the \"specialist\" whose object is to lead his patients from bad to worse. When I think of this aspect of the problem, and of the fact that this damnable traffic is objectionable to all decent citizens, I feel we are justified in saying that quack advertising is a stain on the Scandinavian press.\"",
                "\"Recently we have made progress in our fight against this illegitimate practice and various forces have been coordinated to that effect; nevertheless, the evil is far from having been rooted out. In certain places it is flourishing worse than ever. I am informed that such advertising has long been prohibited in Norway.\"",
                "Parents, teachers and ministers are jointly responsible for the protection of the young generation; they should be aware of the demoralizing effect of such advertising and should exclude from their houses papers which are carrying it.\"",
                "Commenting on Dr. Hektoen's article Lutheraneren writes in an editorial;",
                "\"The subject Dr. Hektoen deals with this time is the worse kind of swindle from the point of view of honest advertising. It is the kind that is aimed at young men. Fortunately there are but a few Norwegian papers carrying such advertising. There are some, however, and we agree with Dr. Hektoen that the matter is a stain on the Scandinavian press of America. A more abominable traffic than that of destroying the morals and character of youth can hardly be imagined. The papers guilty of such crime should be banned from the homes.\"",
                "\"Speaking on the subject of advertising, we think that the kind of advertising which promises gold and green pastures to those investing money in mining enterprises should also be put on the black list. Such enterprises are often organized for speculative purposes with a tendency to end in sheer humbug, not differing much from the other kind in character.\"",
                "During its meeting of June 13, the Scandinavian Medical Society adopted a new resolution concerning the above subject and announced its determination to continue the fight against illegitimate, false and misleading advertising carried on by the Scandinavian American press, The Danish Pioneer in particular."

Mr. Larsen has only a grammar school education acquired in a country school in Denmark and later supplemented by evening school in Chicago.",
                "He has however, been studying physics and chemistry privately for a long time; particularly these last three years since discovering the possibility of photographing a lightning flash simply by moving the camera in the opposite direction of it and crosswise. The negative thus obtained appeared so interesting to him that he decided to send it to the Smithsonian Institute in Washington. From that Organization he modestly inquired whether or not scientists there would consider it of any value. As a reply Mr. Larsen received almost immediately a scholarship from the Institute which enabled him to continue his experiments and to get expert assistants who were well able to help him in the construction of a camera suitable for that particular purpose. Recently the Smithsonian Institute, under auspices of the government, has issued a publication containing information about Mr. Larsen's experiments. The publication is edited by Mr. Larsen himself. In it he states that a lightning flash is not a single unit as has been thought hitherto and as it also appears to the onlooker. It consists of a number of more or less parallel flashes. A number of new and interesting facts about lightning phenomena are accounted for in this publication. Mr. Larsen's discoveries are of importance only from the standpoint of science, of course, and are measured in so infinitesimal terms as a two-thousandth of a second. Besides his experiments with lightning photographing Mr. Larsen has among other things in physics also invented a primitive barometer which is well known in the world of science and called the Larsen Barometer.",
                "Backed by the Smithsonian Instituted and the United States National Museum, he has studied the contents of the atmosphere and made interesting discoveries pertaining to air substances (gas) and light-waves radiating from certain mineral and chemical matters. At present he is occupied with the idea of photographing electric sparks and X-Rays etc. according to principles established by himself.",
                "Mr. Axel Larsen is a brother to our well-known society leader, Mr. L. Bendix Larsen, president of the Singing Society Magneten (The Magnet). Mr. Larsen went to Denmark a couple of weeks ago where he will enjoy a vacation."

It was a dreadful fracture, I must say, and I have never seen so many precautions taken in an operation. Dr. Dahl made me wash and scrub my hands twice and sterilize myself before going near the patient. All science knows about asepsis was used, and I do not think that any surgeon in Chicago could do better, I don't care who he may be. I am an old practitioner, having been a surgeon for twenty-four years, and I have had quite a lot of experience; so I ought to know something about it.\"",

                "About two years ago, Revyen mentioned that the well-known Danish chemist, A. Franch Philipson, had discovered a disinfectant he named \"Tarx.\" Tarx is produced from coal tar, and appears in a solid form. It can be dissolved in either hot or cold water. The advantage is that this product can be shipped through the mail because of its solid form, which is quite a saving.",
                "The company which manufactures Tarx has its own factory here in Chicago, and is sold throughout the country, mostly to the farmers. It is used as a Tick eradicator. It is also used as a disinfectant in hospitals, camps, stock yards, railroad cars, etc.",
                "The company recently made a yearly contract with the Canadian Government to supply them with Tarx, where it will be used in all government institutions.",
                "Mr. Philipson has patented his discovery in several European countries, also in South America, where it will be used as a stock disinfectant. He has already received quite a number of large orders.",
                "In order to avoid misunderstanding, it is understood that Tarx is in no way similar to the discovery Philipson made during the War. This was a liquid gas that could kill the population of an entire city in a few minutes. Philipson gave this discovery to the American Government without cost."

The fresh air goes into the wall space of the stove through a pipe from beneath the floor; the hot air goes out at the top of the stove and circles around the room. The used air is heavier than the hot air; hence it goes to the floor and slips out at an opening in the floor which is connected with the chimney. The draft in the chimney works like a pump and drains the foul air out."

                "It was a little valley in the sand dunes of Indiana, as untamed a spot as can be found in this part of the world. The flickering, crackling campfire of resinous branches lighted up the surrounding jack pines and scrub vales. Outside and above was pitch blackness, such as you only see in the wilderness. A few score men and women were gathering about the fire, waiting expectantly for something - they knew what. Presently their leader, the man whose spirit and enthusiasm had infected them all and brought them there together, rose to his feet. He was bareheaded and the fitful gusts from the gathering storm toyed with his shaggy, gray locks.",
                "He asked that they sing \"America, the Beautiful.\" It was like a hymn. Then he spoke. The occasion was a memorial to Enos Mills, the Colorado Naturalist, whose career had come to an end but a short time ago. The speaker was eloquent, but his emotion, the affection he had for the deceased interpreter of nature overcame him. He was forced to cease and he stepped back into the fringe of darkness.",
                "This man was Jens Jensen. The others about the campfire were the members of the Friends of Our Native Landscape. No one there that night will forget the incident. It showed powerfully the genuineness and deepness of feeling that possess this simple, unspoiled Chicagoan, who was grieved by the death of his dear friend Mills and at the same time was depressed by the imminent fate that hangs over the dunes, our mountains, the only mountains that we of Chicago have. The sorrow in his voice was unmistakably real.",
                "This Jens Jensen, this Chicago man from the sand dune country of Denmark, this simple-hearted citizen, who has taught Chicagoans to understand the beauty that lies in this flat country of ours, has several distinctions.",
                "In the first place, he is rightly called the man who loves the soul of the landscape. He has a sympathetic understanding of what the dune, the moraine, the flood plain, and the spreading prairie are trying to say. And as a landscape architect he has been able to disclose nature's varying motifs probably with more success than any other person. He develops the spirit of the concept that is native to the soil and the waters. This can be seen in many places in the great west parks, especially in the prairie river of Humboldt Park. It can be seen over and again in the county forest preserves. It is developed in every bit of landscape upon which Jens Jensen puts his hand and the mark of his genius. There is nothing exotic, nothing foreign, not a pagoda or a garden brought in for mere ornament, but the thing that is indigenous to the location. If there were fairies and dryads in the woods and wilderness of Illinois, they would all be calling Mr. Jensen by his first name.",
                "His story is easily told. He was born in 1860 and studied in Denmark and Germany. Marrying in 1884 and coming to America in that year, he began work in the parks of Chicago as a laborer and in a short time became superintendent of the small units of the west park system. He was superintendent of Humboldt Park from 1894 to 1900; landscape architect and general superintendent of the west parks from 1906 to 1909. In all this there is nothing about the Cook County forest preserves, yet the magnificent stretches of prairie and forest owe much to Jens Jensen's labor, enthusiasm, and understanding.",
                "Early in the 1900's the idea of the forest preserve was forming in the minds of a small group of thoughtful Chicagoans, most of whom were associated with George Hooker, George Sikes, and others in the Municipal Science Club. The idea of a forest preserve took root and grew. Its plan was municipal at first and presently it expanded into the huge thing it now is. When Dwight H. Perkins was made secretary of the forest preserve organization he became associated with Jensen who was invaluable for the technical side especially in the choice of sites. This was because Jens Jensen, accompanied by Mrs. Jensen, and frequently carrying the Jensen babies, had been studying the land about Chicago for many years. They roamed the country about Pullman and as the town spread into the places they loved, they went further. They traveled through the dunes and all the other outlying wild stretches about the city. Thus it happened that when it came time to make these bits of country over into playgrounds for the people, Jens Jensen was pre-eminently the man who knew the way.",
                "It is interesting to note how Jensen has affected the minds of Chicago people. Carl Sandburg, radical and poet, says: \"If I were asked to name the ten most useful men in Chicago, I would put Jensen down as one. Have you seen his work in Garfield Park? I used to pass there every day, and I loved it.\"",
                "George E. Hooker, the gentlest of reformers says: \"From a somewhat wide observation of outdoor public art in America and Europe, I should say that the work of no one in that line in our day has surpassed, if indeed it has equaled in interest, creative spirit, and orginality, that which Jens Jensen has done in Chicago and vicinity. His outdoor pictures have a uniqueness and a reference back to nature herself that show the elusive secret of his genius.\"",
                "\"In South Jutland there is a small peninsula where Jens Jensen's father had a farm,\" says J. Christian Bay of the Crerar Library,\" and I believe it was on that very farm that the first red monastic bricks were made. The landscape is of broad fertile fields with the sea beyond. I am quite certain that for a time he walked about in wooden shoes - a kind of closeness to the soil.",
                "\"The South Jutlanders were freeborn men, but they were forbidden to speak their native language: they were fined and imprisoned for singing their native songs.",
                "In this way they developed a fine sense of responsibility upon which freedom will grow like a beautiful flower. This flower grew for Jens Jensen under the sky of Chicago. In a very short time he acquired an appreciation for our natural landscape, which is that of the prairie. As a landscape gardener he refused to combine any foreign elements with this, and it is magnificent to see what this man can create out of the prairie: the naked plain with a background of white pine whose architecture is almost beyond human comprehension of beauty, and a tiny river.",
                "\"But this man's freedom extends far beyond this. The life in the open holds possibilities which you cannot even divine behind the walls of skyscrapers. Within the skyscraper idea in life, in politics, in social affairs will not prevail. He is absolutely devoid of fear, especially fear of the mighty.\"",
                "Jens Jensen is now recognized as a great landscape architect. He won his first fame in the west parks, taking hold there when they were at the lowest level of political exploitation. President B. A. Eckhardt stood behind him and great things were done. The west parks still feel the momentum that Jens Jensen gave them. He does not care for such positions at this time.",
                "He has worked for Chicago's small parks, big parks, and the forest preserves. Today he has a still greater vision of a system of forest preserves for the whole state.",
                "This man has studied and discovered the beauty that is our natural heritage. He has expressed it in parks and forest preserves and private domains. He has communicated this loving sympathy to others, which is an even greater feat. Altogether Jens Jensen's career is an integral part of the development of western democratic art that the west needs to appreciate for its own good.",

They appeal to the fine feelings of mankind, and elevate the depressed in soul and mind to a higher place in the human family, and to a greater appreciation of the responsibilities of free born men and women. When the psychological conditions of a race, through the influence of environment, reach a point where this influence develops into consciousness and thus can be understood by the human mind, new and different thoughts and ideas are born, and the race, as a whole, raises its standards of civilization accordingly.\""

                "Many changes have taken place within the Trinity congregation during that period. Ministers have come and gone, old members have passed away, and new one have taken their places, but Dupont-Hansen has remained on his job at the organ.",
                "Some persons may say that the organ player himself is not important; rather that the music is the important issue; but this attitude should not be taken toward church music, and it is particularly unfair to Dupont-Hansen. It is a well-recognized fact that the musical aspect of the services in Danish churches has been greatly neglected until recently. In the old country the presence of an organ in the church was a rarity. Usually the local school-master led the singing, and in many instances his knowledge of music was rather incomplete. But this was not true of the Church of England, for there the musical portion of the church service has been upheld as a fundamental tradition since time immemorial. Recently, churchgoers in Denmark have come to realize the importance of music, with the result that a number of churches have been equipped with organs.",
                "Over here, of course, we had to begin in a very modest way. It was not always within the means of a small congregation to purchase an organ, and we accepted this state of affairs philosophically, because we were accustomed to doing so. Of the many Danish churches in America now equipped with organs, Trinity Lutheran Church is recognized as outstanding for its excellent music--thanks to the efforts and performances of Georg Dupont-Hansen. It was he who awakened our appreciation of music, and it is he who deserves credit for the installation of Trinity Church's beautiful organ.",
                "The influence which Dupont-Hensen's music has had on Danish congregations elsewhere in the United States is far from negligible.",
                "Georg Dupont-Hansen was born in Chicago, and is a member of a musical family. He is, as we all know, totally blind, having lost his sight in an accident during his early youth. After regaining his health, except for his eyesight, Dupont-Hansen went to Denmark, where he received an excellent musical training. He studied under such masters as August Winding, piano; G. Attrup, organ; and Osea Rosenhoff, musical theory and composition.",
                "Properly trained, and possessing great musical knowledge, Dupont-Hansen returned to Chicago ready for work. He has displayed considerable ability as a composer, although he has had little time to develop this talent. He has dedicated himself almost exclusively to playing the organ and directing choirs in Danish churches. This work is and always has been poorly paid, which is the price one must pay when one limits himself to employment by people of his own nationality in this country. This is the destiny of our church workers, many whom possess outstanding ability; they must remain amateurs because we do not appreciate their work, and because our contributions are not sufficient to support them financially. Be they authors, musicians, or artists they are always willing to give their best for our benefit, and yet must earn their living by hard work during their spare time. Such is the tradition of a generation of immigrants--apparently it is unchangeable. Georg Dupont-Hansen earned his living mainly by working as a music teacher.",
                "Despite physical and economic handicaps, Dupont-Hansen succeeded in completing a great work in 1917, consisting of an edition of melodies for the Dansk Folkesamfunds Songbook (Book of Danish Folk Songs). It has been called the best edition of Danish folk melodies ever published in America, and is appreciated in Denmark too.",
                "As a composer Dupont-Hansen has produced three cantatas--a Christmas cantata, a church cantata, and one composed for the dedication of the Danish Children's Home in Chicago. Dupont-Hansen is the author of three compositions for the piano, published in Copenhagen, and \"Theme with Variations,\" published in Leipzig, Germany. Other compositions of his which should be mentioned are \"Moonshine on the Ocean,\" which is very popular on both sides of the Atlantic, and \"Nirvanna,\" very popular in America.",
                "During all these years, Dupont-Hansen has been working patiently as a music teacher, and his pupils can be counted by the thousands. His taste for good music has been of great help to many who have thereby learned appreciation of music. He has a very pleasing personality and is intensely interested in what is going on around him, though deprived of the all-important use of his eyes. Consequently he has been able to gather young and old people to sing in choirs, etc. Despite the fact that the crowds have never been large in our small churches, if we were to consider the time which he has spent in this work, the number of persons who have responded to Dupont-Hansen's musical influence would be great.",
                "Even though these choirs are not well known outside of Danish circles they must be regarded as among the best Danish choirs in Chicago, because they are composed of young voices which respond more readily to good instruction.",
                "We can safely predict that Danish music and songs will live longer in this country than any of the other folklore and tradition brought with us from our native land. This is true not only because they are genuine cultural aspects, but also because a few energetic musicians like Georg Dupont-Hansen have dedicated themselves to the work of preserving that inheritance and conveying it to the younger generations.",
                "No doubt Dupont-Hansen could have become better known and had a much greater field of activity had he gone outside Danish circles, but he preferred to stay among the Danes. As a result, his work is valued and respected in every part of the United States where Danish music and songs are popular."

Mr. Dupont-Hansen has given quite a few concerts around Chicago, and his selections have always been well chosen. He has been a conductor of Danish church choirs in Chicago for many years, and thanks to his ability, these comparatively small groups have been able to organize choirs whose performances must be classified among the best in Chicago.",
                "George Dupont-Hansen's choir consists of one hundred and fifty young voices whose songs will please your ear. This will be a jubilee concert, inasmuch as Dupont-Hansen has been an organist for Trinity Lutheran Church the past thirty years, as well as conductor of Danish choirs. His many friends, members of the church or not, surely will fill the church in appreciation of Dupont-Hansen's many years of tireless, unselfish work for the promotion of Scandinavian music.",

The Singing societies have been considering raising a monument on his grave for a long time, and because many of the younger singers have not known Elberg and of his importance to Danish songs, we reprint an article by Fred Oppenhagen which appeared in this paper:",
                "Mr. Elberg was born in Copenhagen in 1840. He became a student at the Metropolitan school in 1859. He was a musical genius, having been trained by three of Denmark's foremost musicians: Rung, Gade, and Hartman. He became a member of well-known triple quartet of the student's society, afterwards he was librarian for the society. We quickly advanced from a member of the Academic Sharpshooters to Adjutant, Major, and at last, Chief of Garrison school. Then he passed his examinations in Liberal Arts, majoring in Greek and Hebrew, and prepared for two of the best schools in Copenhagen: Borgerdyden and Mariboes.",
                "Elberg came to America in the eighties, and he soon became active in the musical field. He became director of several singing societies. Among them were: Freja, Valhalla, Harmonien, and the Norwegian society, \"Bjorgvin,\" in Chicago; Hamlet Society in Racine, and several German societies. Wherever he was active, we noticed progress in a musical sense. It was the hands of a master that held the reins.",
                "The long and beneficial activity of Elberg in this particular period was one of the luminous points in his existence, after he lost his sight, he went to live at the Old Peoples' Home, and whenever a singer visited him there, the discussion usually was music. The erect figure became more erect. His cheeks would flush, a warm, friendly smile would wreath his lips as he would begin to tell of his experiences. It was a pleasure to see how bright a bind he still had, even to the end. He was a human lexicon, who could remember and explain everything. As we sat and listened to him, we saw the ardent expression on his face, we saw him in our mind as the student, the intelligent journalist, the happy, dynamic, conversationalist, and the excellent speaker. We then understood why he could train a chorus so harmoniously.",
                "The Danish Singing Societies met in hurmony at Elberg's bier with lowered banners, and now they put all their efforts to the task of raising a monument as a tribute to the man that was faithful to his art to the very end."

The text is spirited and in harmony with the buoyant Danish air that will lighten the weary marches for our boys in blue as it has ever quickened the steps of the Danish soldiers since 1848, when it burst upon the Danish army as a sudden revelation of the reawakened enthusiasm and rising national spirit of the people. The tune is a favorite, not only with the Danes, but also with Norwegians and Swedes, and as our Scandinavian citizens are well represented in most of our camps the familiar refrain will be take up by them and thus catch the ear of the army. That is all that is necessary to insure its popularity. The quick-step stanzas of the text compare favorably with other war songs of the day, and the striking air is in keeping with our national temperament and high-spirited and optimistic character of the present war.",

                "As we gaze upon these noble masterpieces of sculpture on such a gigantic scale, a feeling of awe comes over us and catches the inspiration of the permanent and enduring nature of brave and noble deeds of statesmanship.",
                "It seems here that Mother Nature has spread before us an appropriate background and setting for the work of the sculptor which must follow. Far away from cities and buildings, far away from studio and chisel, far away from the maddening crowd, one can look upon the lofty mountain top and catch, as it were, a glimpse into the great Infinite, and feel his kinship with Mother Nature.",
                "At the instance of President Coolidge, our Congress wisely left the selection of location and details of construction, as well as the design and general idea, to Gutzon Borglum, who is of Danish descent, bold and aggressive in thought, fearless and free, well equipped to carve the heroic likenesses of our patriots.",
                "His studies and concepts of historical faces and figures in many branches of art have long since been recognized by our government and have placed him in the front rank as a sculptor and artist and have endeared him especially in the minds of those who are familiar with the history of our country and government. It is interesting to note that Borglum's creations possess some of the characteristics of Thorvaldsen's, and yet Borglum's creations stand strictly in a class by themselves.",
                "Gutzon Borglum is the son of Doctor James De La Mothe Borglum and Ida Michelson, and was born in 1872 in Idaho. His parents came West over the Oregon Trail and settled in Idaho as frontiers-men.",
                "He began his education in the public schools in the cities of Freemont and Omaha, Nebraska. Later he began to pursue art as a study in San Francisco. His originality began to assert itself, and he went abroad to continue his studies. In Paris he studied at the Julian Academy Elode des Beaux, where he obtained the degrees of Master of Arts and Doctor of Law. He is very versatile and among other things shows an unusual talent for aero-dynamics. He exhibited his paintings and sculptures in a salon, of which he later was made an associate.",
                "Subsequently, he divided his time among European cities and capitals, still pursuing his art, especially sculpture.",
                "Among his various attainments are the following:",
                "Sheridan equestrian statues in Washington, D. C., and Chicago; Colossal bust of Lincoln in the rotunda of the Capital at Washington; heroic group of statuary in bronze in Newark, entitled \"Wars of America;\" designer of confederate memorial on the face of Stone Mountain in Georgia; designer of confederate memorial coin struck in honor of confederate soldier, and many others.",
                "Mr. Borglum has never been continuously active as a member of any one political party since the nature of his work requires him to mingle with many organizations in this country.",
                "Mr. Borglum is very happily married to Mary Montgomery, who has been of great assistance to him in arranging the details of his business matters. They have two children, Mary Ellis, fourteen, and Lincoln, eighteen.",
                "He is now planning a visit to Poland, and during this visit he will unveil his bronze statue of our late President Wilson. He has stated that he is proud of his Danish ancestry and has acquired a very fluent knowledge of Danish, and takes great pride in discussing Danish matters in the mother tongue. He has also expressed his intention of visiting his ancestral castle in Jutland during the coming year.",
                "The main dedication took place at Mount Rushmore, August 10, 1927. President Coolidge was present and delivered a memorial address.",
                "The dedication ceremonies of the completed face of Washington took place on July 4, 1930, with appropriate historical addresses and a program."

Nielsen, was well read by Carl Antonsen. Miss Harriet Hertz sang a couple of songs. The best actor was Carl Antonsen as Friherre Claes. Among the other players were: Mrs. Carl Antonsen, who was very nervous at the start; Miss Magna Petersen, Tom Andersen, Alb. Kear, A. M. Petersen, Edw. Petersen, Thv. Sommer, Mr. Didrichsen, Emanuel Johansen, and Miss Gerda Henius. The play was well done and the result was that Chicago saw the greatest theatre crowd of Chicago-Danes that has been seen since the visit of Mrs. Oda Nielsen, a famous Danish actress from Copenhagen.",

                "A concert given by Trinity's Young People's Orchestra last Friday night turned out to be a success. The basement hall was packed to capacity, and the programme was excellently arranged, with Opera Singer Paul Bai and little Phyllis Dahue as soloists. The latter revealed unquestionable dramatic talent, and was irresistible in her elocution. Of Paul Bai's presentations \"The Three Comrades\" was received with actual enthusiasm. In this song his artistry came to its full expression, and the audience called for several da capo numbers. Young Mr. Glen Holtan played several rather difficult arrangements on the piano. But the crowning hit of the evening was \"Desert Caravan\" played by the orchestra with astonishing skill. With the various instruments clearly distinguishable the musicians managed to convey an actual oriental atmosphere to the audience. As a closing number the orchestra played a selection of patriotic melodies.",
                "Mr. John Andersen, young energetic leader and conductor of the orchestra, deserves appreciation for his work of promoting good music."

In this united chorus, which had been in existence since August, 1909, Harmonien had twenty singers.

It was a very festive and solemn moment when the delightful tunes by organist Geo. Dupont-Hansen thundered out under the lofty and beautiful arches in Consistory Hall to an audience of 1200 people, who had arrived on time. There seemed to be a devout feeling when Ivar Kirkegaard's poetic and musically inspired prologue was recited by Carl Antonsen with a skill and warmth that only he can master. The soft accompaniment of the organ was played by Geo. Dupont-Hansen with themes from Gades' music.",

But this honor he divided with his orchestra.",
                "Even though he is just recuperating from an operation, and probably has not regained his old force, Holger Pedersen sang Spillemanden's \"Vise\" (the Musician's Song), beautifully and touching in his soft, genuine Danish tenor. At first, we noticed nervousness, and a few frozen notes in the chorus, but it was not many seconds before a melodious and harmonious chorus sang the well-known tunes right from the heart. The Nordic national spirit was well expressed, and in some places exceptionally so. It gave promise to the concert's star number, \"Elverskud,\" and the promise was well kept, as far as the chorus was concerned. There was a buoyancy, impetus, and force in the songs as they were started with precision and stopped with an exactness that brought out the strong dramatic effect of \"Elverskud.\" It was to Emil Biorn's credit that he had brought so many batons and voices under his own baton, and created one grand chorus out of a multitude of male and female voices. It was a pleasant surprise to hear this splendid chorus, at the same time it was a surprise of another kind that the soloists did not stand on a par with the chorus. The well developed voice of Mrs. Frandsen was by far the best, but cracked in the high notes. The other soloists were very bad, as they did not know their task, to say it mildly. In defense, we know that they had undertaken their work with very short notice, because the previously engaged artist had declined at the last moment.",
                "Even though the concert was not what it should have been, it was in many ways an interesting presentation of Danish music and songs that brought a tribute to the memory of Niels Wilhelm Gades which would have made the master very happy if he had lived to hear it."

The artists, Mr. and Mrs. Hammer, as professionals, were the only ones able to show any artistisc ability. It must be said that the rest of the cast is without mention, though everyone did his best to make the play a success.",
                "Rolf Hammer played the part of \"Bygmnester Solness\" with great force, and true understanding of his part.",

                "At the Same time, we had the opportunity to see Lido Lossuius as \"Mrs. Aline Solness,\" Jacob T. Reynertson as \"Doctor Herdal,\" Joseph Sorensen as Knut Brovik,\" Bie Markussen as \"Ragnar Brovik,\" and Helga Blichfeldt as \"Kaja Fosli.\" When we cleared Ibsen's usual mysticism away, we understood that he wanted to show \"Bygmester Solness\" valuing the importance of keeping one's youth.",
                "Man must have the courage to rise as he aims, and as high as he builds. This can only be done in the flower of his youth, or if we have been able to guard our youth, beneath our gray hair.",
                "\"Bygmester Solness\" could do this when he saw \"Hilde Wangel\" for the first time. He could then rise to highest heights, because he was young. He could descend again, unhurt, because he did not become dizzy. Ten years later, he could not, because trying to become great, the greatest of all, he had lost his youth. So he had really become small, without courage or strength to ascend to higher heights. He believes he has won back his youth. He does not know it is lost, and lost youth can never be regained. When he tries to rise as high as he has built, he falls and is destroyed. This is what Mr. Harmer portrayed in his role.",
                "\"Hilde Wangel\" is the personification of \"Bygmester Solness'\" youth. In the years that had passed, \"Solness\" had forgotten the embraces and kisses. When they met again, they both wanted a reunion, but they only built castles in the air, and, therefore, they tumbled down. Mrs. Hammer not only portrayed \"Solness'\" youth, but she was youth. Therefore, she could rise as high as she had aimed and built. That was why her portrayed was rapturous. It was admirable to note the sincerity with which she portrayed the many different sentiments of her role. And her last lines, \"I will never see him again,\" brought out such heart felt pain over the loss of \"Solness,\" when he went into the world where nothing more can be done because youth is gone.",

The crowd began coming during the afternoon and enjoyed a preliminary program of music and recitations by Mr. and Mrs. Frandeen and Hans Didrichsen.",

His audience was brought to both tears and laughter by his charaterization of the simple, lovable old farmer with his trials and tribulation. Mrs. Julie Boas as Mille and Mr. P. Boas as old shoemaker Jacob were somewhat weak in their portrayal of these characters while \"Baron\" and \"Judge\" by Andreas Frandsen could not have been more realisticaly portrayed. The Doctor, the Attorney, the Baliff and Magnus were played by Hans Didrichsen, Alf. Rasmussen, Hugo Meyer and Herman Olsen were pleasing in a natural manner leaving no sense of unreality of exaggeration of character.",

A short time ago there was an announcement regarding A.B.C. Scandinaven made it a farce by saying how deep and clever the author of the A.B.C. was to write such a wonderful book. But before Christmas a stage show was played. It's name was Newlywed, by \"Bjornson\"; Scandinavian critics stated that he saw the same show at the Royal Theatre in Copenhagen, but that there was no comparison; the Chicago amateurs were far above the Royal theatre. Chicago actors played in a much more refined and delicate style, etc. That is the kind of criticism Scandinaven dares print when it is well-known, too, that the Chicago actors are only amateurs, trying to bring a little joy to their countrymen in Chicago, That is the thanks Scandinaven is giving them, comparing them with star professional actors."

These old folk dances show typical temperaments of the various nations.",
                "The Danish folk dances differ from most others in their soft and carefree movements and are symbolical of Denmark, its people and nature. There are, however, dances that are typical of other nations as well.",
                "When the common people gathered in the olden days, it was through dancing they expressed their feelings--it was the spiritual language, understood and loved by all, through which the moods and strifes of their daily lives found experssion. Typical are the Shoemakers' Dance and the Weavers (Weaving Wadmel). The dance that occurs most frequently in all folk dancing is the waltz, which took form in the 16th century in France.",
                "The Polka, a Bohemian national dance, was first danced by the peasants, but during the 18th century it gained popularity in many other countries. The Gallop which is a Hungarian dance is also very old. The Quadrille was danced all over Europe in the 16th century. The Polonaise and Mazurka are Polish and Russian dances. From these, many other dances, have been created.",
                "In Denmark, the old folk dances have relinquished their popularity in favor of the more modern ballroom dancing, a mixture of everything and not much of anything with the exception of such specialty dances as the tango and, of course, the waltz. The \"Society for Promotion of Folk Dances in Denmark\" has successfully undertaken to gather up the old Danish folk dances and melodies in order to preserve the culture, they represent. In every hamlet in Denmark these dances still hold sway both for their wholesome fun and their cultural value, and is considered by the people as a precious possesion to be handed down to future generations.",
                "Also in America have we folk dances. This country has come to value and appreciate their cultural influence. Many minor schools as well as universities practice folk dancing. Among the Danes in America, folk dancing is a natural feature at gatherings and festivities. There are at least fifty different groups throughout the states who enthusiastically strive to promote folk dancing.",
                "Our dances are, no doubt, best suited for the American schools because they are easy to learn and understand and are as light and carefree as the typical American."

The most prevailant excuse for the lack of this seems to be that the Danes are divided into so many groups, lodges, clubs, choruses, etc., that it is difficult to bring about an agreement to any degree.",

But he suggests that every Danish-American organization in Chicago send a delegate to a convention so that a league of Danish-American organizations may be formed that can and will show Chicago and the world that there are Danes that are capable of working together to preserve their adopted country, as well as to further the culture and traditions of the country of their birth or ancestry. A league of that type can do much to bring about a better understanding between groups in all parts of Chicago, and to get them together for the celebration of a common Danish holiday to say nothing of putting the Danish-American people on the map of Chicago in the celebration of our own U.S. holidays. Our fellowcitizens will wake up to the fact that there is a country by the name of Denmark that has thousands of her children and grand children, who are becoming good citizens of Chicago and the U.S.A.",

                "The latter was the world's greatest gathering of Danes outside of Denmark. We demonstrated conclusively that Danes could celebrate the Drachman Festival and the 100th anniversary of the birth of H. C. Anderson, which resulted further in the initiative of Danish-American organizations and also resulted in the establishment of the beautiful Danish Children's Home. This built, in no small part, by contributions collected by the H.C.Anderson committee.",
                "We Danes have ably demonstrated the possibility of uniting for a common cause. Let us now concentrate upon forming a committee to bring about a Danish Day in common, without religious or political barriers, where old organizations can be renewed, new friendships established and a combined support from Danish-American institutions can be brought about.",
                "We especially appeal for united efforts on behalf of our Old Peoples Home in Norwood Park and the Orphanage on Evergreen Avenue. Let us, for example, make June 6, a prominent annual event in Danish-American History and show Chicago and the country at large that our people here are more than an insignificant group, and are to be highly respected.",
                "Every Dane in Chicago and vicinity is urged to attend the 60th anniversary of Constitution Day. We urge you to come with the firm conviction that in showing an interest in the old land you are better citizens of the land of your adoption."

During the nineties he started the Aid Society and arranged the big concert in Central Hall which gave the same society $800.

Even Saeby is happy because Harold Bergstedt lives there despite his battles with the local police and liquor dealers which, however, have resulted in his books finding their way into every home of the town as do Aakjaer's and Skjoldberg's books in their respective home towns and surrounding territories. And do you remember how beloved Holger Drachman was in his native Skagen?",

Also in America it has been a great pleasure for me to sing this song the beautiful words of which should appeal to every Danish born American. I hope that this song will be sung, not alone by all your professionals(here I think particularly of one who is gifted with real talent, namely,Laurids Christensen), but also by all Danes in their homes. I hope it will be reserved a permanent place on the piano in every home for mama and the children to play and sing when papa comes home from work tired and exhausted.",

It was written by a well-known and respected Danish-American, who for many years had charge of the Chicago marriage License Bureau. Mr. M. Salmonsen has published some of his most interesting experiences as a marriage clerk in from the Marriage License Window, which book was a sellout. Recently, Mr. Salmonsen wrote a new book, Among Jews. It is a collection of short stories and sketches about the life, trend of thought, customs and traditions peculiar to the Jewish race, which race, despite persecution and dispersion over a long period of time, has preserved its distinctive features and developed into a powerful factor in modern civilization. In one of the stories, \"A Fervent Zionist,\" a character, named Dr. Frank, gives a synopsis of the rather new feature of Jewry called Zionism, the aims and purposes of which are to unite all Jews and incorporate a Jewish State either in old Palestine or in Argentina.",
                "Most of the stories concern Jews who for some reason or other have left the Old World and established themselves over here. Mr. Salmonsen's presentations bear a stamp of sympathy and deep understanding, coupled with a keen sense of humor, all of which enables him to give the human frailties and shortcomings, peculiar to the Jews, the once over. The closing chapter, \"Thirteen at a Dinner Party,\" is almost classical in its touching simplicity.",
                "Carl Block's famous etching, \"A Jew,\" adorns the front cover, and no lesser personality than Dr. Emil G. Hirsh has furnished the preface in which he says:",
                "\"The author has looked at Jewish life from within. His own temperament has felt something of the pathos of the life about which he brings us an account. May his narrative help to spread the more profound sympathies which, responding to the unities of human love and labor, are potent factors in cementing the bonds of respect and understanding between the various components of the human family.\"",

                "The Danish author, Carl Ewald, is beginning to be appreciated on the American book markets, in which the above three books appear, excellently translated and nicely bound with original green covers. The press and the public have welcomed Carl Ewald's books in a way so encouraging, that we have reason to expect more of his works, translated and published in the near future.",
                "My Little Boy contains a collection of sound, delightful sketches of children in daily life; Two Legs is a fairy tale, depicting the creation of man and his victory over the animals. The Spider and Other Tales is a dozen of Ewald's best fairy tales about animals, plants and other nature's phenomena. Any of the three books will be appreciated by little boys or girls probably by the boys in particular, because of the author's daring style, which is high above silly sentimentality. Grown-ups will receive as much pleasure from reading these books as children. Carl Ewald's vivid description of nature is healthy and refreshing reading for anyone."

The moth-eaten Danish-American was thoroughly dead and stagnant until Danish Times showed itself above the horizon. Then a few papers and periodicals slowly awakened, while others still slept on, peacefully. We have never thought that we could get all the Danish readers in America, but we do believe by giving our readers a clean, well edited, and interesting paper, it will be possible to improve other Danish papers. This has been proven in a few cases, while it is apparent that some papers will fall by the wayside.",

They used their scissors a lot, cutting most of their material out of Denmark's papers, reprinted old novels, without receiving a penny for space, and called it a paper. Original material, good or bad, was seldom seen. Illustrations belonging to modern journalism were few and far between, and the few that appeared were very bad.",

Another paper has uncovered a number of old cuts, with which they try to please their readers, in order to show that the paper is not asleep well, they do the best they can in the face of new competition. Very commendable, but a few new cuts would serve the purpose much better.",
                "A third paper, which can not produce much on account of old age, has increased its sentimental stories. This is a very bad policy, because the duty of a paper is to give clear, honest, and interesting news, in order to improve the contents of the reading matter, whether it is metropolitan or rural. Probably there may be a few readers that could be satisfied with material of this kind, but the taste for good reading is in danger of being spoiled, so our press should try to do their best, even though it may be difficult. We hope that this particular paper will change its tactics so that they may become our competitor. It will make us very happy if all our competitors would try to give their readers better and better papers. It is our goal to give our Danish-American readers just as good a press here as they have in Denmark."

The press of Chicago, and particularly that element of it which, with broad vision, studies the evolution, is slowly creating an American people out of seeds from the ends of the world and will welcome the advent of this newspaper. It will not only keep the Danish born of the middle west in touch with events and problems of peculiar interest to themselves, but through them it will go far to enrich American civilization with the culture, art, sentiment, and aspirations, which may be borrowed from Danish history and Danish life.",
                "I believe there are more than twenty or perhaps thirty foreign language papers in Chicago. Each of them is a force in the rapid development of Americanism, each is a chemical in the great melting pot.

The Chefoo Daily News was a four page paper, but it had cable dispatches, which kept us in touch with our own people and at the same time served to encourage and solidify the handful of us who were so far adrift.",

This publication ran afoul of the Japanese government. The editor rather favored the Russian side of the argument and was a person who spoke and wrote his mind. Therefore, he was in jail for a while. I mention this only because in this free country your paper may voice the opinion of its readers, and remain at large under a constitution which guarantees the freedom of the press.",

It is well that he should have a newspaper which will preserve and renew these views for the benefit of the great democracy in which he now finds himself.",
                "The importance of his attitude may best be gleaned, perhaps, from the fact that it is the custom of the President of the United States to keep in touch with the editorial sentiment of the foreign language papers. Secretaries read these papers, and a digest is prepared for the President. Occasionally an entire editorial, or a news article, if unusual, or of great importance, is presented to him. This is only natural. To be President of all the people, it is necessary to keep in touch with the sentiment of all the people.",

On this date, thirty years ago, Andersen was elected a member of Social-Demokraten's Committee of control, and Hordum as representative for the same paper, later advancing to the position of business manager.",
                "At the time these two men took hold of the reins the paper was about to sink into oblivion. A few thousand faithful subscribers clung to it, however, but the situation was so bad that a leading conservative paper, Dagstelgrafen (Daily Telegraph) declared Socialism \"an artificial movement\" that was doomed to fail in Denmark. But Andersen and Hordum went to work with an enthusiam that is still a worthy example for others to follow, and soon they were effectively assisted by two other good workers, Messrs. P. Knudsen and E. Wynblad. At an important meeting, shortly after the departure of Pio and Geleff, Hordum made the statement that the paper should be kept going \"cost what it may. Without a press we are helpless in our efforts to keep the party intact.\"",
                "The paper was saved, and turned out to be the very soul of a movement of which workers of Denmark have reason to be proud.",
                "We have a particular reason to recall this incident because the Socialist Party in Chicago is going through a critical period similar to the one prevailing in Denmark thirty years ago. The Socialist Party of Chicago has at last succeeded in establishing a daily paper which naturally experiences difficulties, but it must and shall be maintained if for no other reason than for the good start. The paper was virtually created out of nothing and without extensive preliminary arrangements, and yet it is now, after but a few months, adequately and modernly equipped. It is rapidly approaching the point at which the publishers will be able to declare that it pays for itself. Cessation of its publication at this moment would therefore be a shame and an irreparable damage to the socialist movement in this country, especially if it occurs only on account of an unforgivable indifference and lack of understanding on the part of those whose interests the Daily Socialist seeks to protect.",
                "Should the paper fail to weather the storm, we can say as Hordum said thirty years ago, that our most important channel of propaganda for our principles is lost and our strength as a unit is broken.",
                "It must not happen, and this is Revyen's exhortation to its thousands of subscribers: Do what you can to make this incident which occurred in little Denmark thirty years ago an example to be followed in this great country. Buy and read the Daily Socialist; advertise in it!"

In his responding speech, Dr. Brandes thanked the city for the fine reception which it had given him, and in expressing his admiration for America, revealed a sincere appreciation of this country's ranking place in world affairs materially as well as spiritually.",
                "Thus ended his two-day visit, and the memory of it will stay with us for a long time."

The ideals of the Socialist Party were presented in opposition and in a manner so convincing that it is to be regretted that the whole world could not have been gathered to hear this gifted speaker.",

Madsen delivered a very able and forcible address wherein he urged that every effort be made to learn the language of the new country so as to obtain an understanding of its ideals,and so as to become an active participant in community efforts. He pointed out the mistake many had made in isolating themselves by continuing exclusively in the traditions and language of Denmark. He stated that one might still love and respect the old country while striving in every way to become better acquainted with the new. He especially urged an early acquisition of naturalization papers.",

Those opposing Mr. Madsen urged the new arrivals, first of all, to join their respective trade unions and the Socialist Party. So intense did the discussion become that when the president announced 10:00 o'clock and closing time, it was unanimously decided to continue for another hour. Due to the interest shown in their first open forum, the new Y. P. Organization plan to have such meetings frequently."

Petersen, who is now a druggist on Fullerton Avenue, was his assistant, and they sold many of these irons. Later Riis went to New York, where he started out as a newspaperman on a paper in Brooklyn. He then worked on the New York Tribune, and finally was police reporter on the New York Sun. Soon he started to help the poor in the great slums of New York.

The \"Turk\" had engaged to pin Petersen twice in thirty minutes of wrestling and won the first fall in thirteen minutes. He had learned, during these minutes that he had a worthy opponent and this seemed to anger him to such an extent that he forgot the better in his makeup and started a lot of dirty work that brought a volume of boo's, hisses and catcalls from the entire audience of lovers of clean sport. The disapproval of the crowd did not make him feel any better nor did it call forth an exhibition of reserve, strength or skill and the alloted thirty minutes came and went; Petersen was still unthrown for the second time and he was declared winner of the match. As victor he was given the purse of $100.00 plus about twice that amount as the winners share of the gate. Petersen was given a rousing cheer and was carried to the dressing room on the shoulders of his admirers.",

Riis, after whom one of our Chicago parks has been named. Many gifts came in and for the money collected a bronze-plaque with inscription was bought and inserted in a granite rock which was placed in the park. Unfortunately, during a period of extensive alterations the bronze plaque has been stolen or mislaid, and researches which have been carried on by both the Danish National Committee and the Park Commission have failed to locate the plaque.",

Plans have been drawn for a new building which is to be several times larger than the present one. The officers of the home and the Building Committee hope to raise money enough in the near future to erect this proposed building."

Groups of Danes settled in the vicinity of Wicker Park and Humboldt Park, and in 1910 Dania's building already stood lonely and deserted in the old neighborhood. The wise men in the Society understood at once that Dania also must move, and on March 5, 1910, they were successful in selling the old building for the sum of $20,500. The Society's cash fund amounted at that time to some $8,000, but in spite of all efforts it was not possible to find a suitable building in the new vicinity: For a while Dania rented space in \"Steensland's,\" at that time an elegant villa on Evergreen Avenue; the quarters there being small, they had to hold their large affairs in other more suitable places. The forty-ninth anniversary of the Society was celebrated in Old Style Inn, at the corner of Division Street and California Avenue, a celebration that will be remembered by many of Dania's members today.",

Houlberg, and others, an attempt was made to find lots where a suitable building might be erected, and on November 19, 1911, the committee reported that the Dania Society was the proud owner of two lots, numbers 1651 and 1653 North Kedzie Avenue, which had cost $3,500. On November 24, 1912, the new building was officially dedicated, and that event was followed by a fiftieth anniversary celebration, which occurred on December 29 of the same year.",
                "Dania's elegant hall and the comfortable rooms for social affairs were admired, and soon the hall was used by nearly all Chicago's Danish societies. Great festivities and important events took place, in which Dania displayed its ability to solve problems of a Danish-American nature. As Dania at various times had honored Hans Christian Andersen, Holger Prachmann, and other great Danish names, it now paid homage to Georg Brandes, the Student Singers, Dr. Christian Fenger, and many others.",

He contended that this was strictly an D.B.S. affair in which the public was not concerned. The argument was quietly ruled 'out of order', on the grounds that the open forum made it impossible for a majority to force a new ruling without giving every interested member of the order an opportunity to consider the idea and express an opinion. So long as the D.B.S. does not have its own, but is using \"Revyen\"as its organ of publicity and interlodge communication there could, no just criticism be directed in this case.",

(A) claims that the D.B.S. is strong enough, numerically and financially, to establish such a fund and offers as proof that to data the D.B.S. has met all obligations (nearly a million dollars) promptly and in full and still has a large treasury balance. (B) says D.B.S. should absolutely have such a fund. The old age benefit is preferable to entry into an old peoples home. Old people prefer it to being \"put on the shelf\" in an institution and financially the benefit plan would bring about a saving in actual funds. Comparison of the outlay of the two plans are convincing. On the home plan side $500,00 or $1,000.00 paid the home at time of death vs old age benefit paid monthly to the aged member who gets the benefit of every dollar paid out, as against splitting the amount to cover running expenses of the institution. In addition - a person entering the \"Home\" at the age of sixty-five carrying a$1,000.00 policy obligates the lodge to pay to the institution the amount named in the policy even though the policy holder died within a year or two; under the benefit plan the member would have more freedom and live his normal life and at death the expense to the ledge would end; a saving well worth considering as a means of greater benefits to the aged still living.",

Nearly three hundred lodges, distributed over twenty-six of the northern states, now belong to the organization, which is steadily penetrating into new Danish settlements, extending to the Danish population the advantages of mutual support in case of illness and death. There are many cases where suffering would have been the lot of survivors in families bereft of the provider except for the support extended the family by the Danish Brotherhood.",
                "This organization, the twenty-fifth anniversary of which was celebrated on January 2, 1907, has twenty-seven lodges in Chicago. The oldest of these, Chicago Lodge No. 17, today is celebrating its twenty-fifth anniversary with a banquet and dance at the hall of the Lodge, 315-317 Hirsch Street.",
                "History of Lodge No. 17",
                "After the Danish Brotherhood had made several vain attempts at organizing a lodge in Chicago, Mr. C. F. Hansen, of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, undertook the task of making a new effort. The systematic endeavors he initiated met, however, with stern opposition from many sides. Nonetheless, he did not lose courage, and on March 28, 1884, the first Chicago lodge of the Brotherhood held its installation at a meeting in Dania Hall, under the name \"Chicago Lodge No. 17\". Twenty-three members were inducted at this meeting, and at the following meeting three new members were accepted, so that the Lodge started with twenty-six charter members.",
                "The new Lodge made steady though somewhat slow progress for a while, but when assessments became necessary, and sick benefits were provided, several members left. In addition, several of the original members subsequently withdrew to join the new Lodge No. 18, which had been organized about a month afterwards. Still others, anxious to have a more convenient meeting place, organized Lodge No. 58.",
                "Thus, for a while, Lodge No. 17 had somewhat tough sledding. Quite frequently, it happened that the amounts to be paid as sick aid exceeded the amount in the treasury, and it was not an unusual occurrence for the treasurer to have to advance money from his own funds in order to meet required expenses. In the meantime, the members remaining in the Lodge stuck together; through great sacrifices they aided one another as the need arose, and time has shown that the faith of these men in the future of the Lodge was not misplaced.",
                "Several charter members of Lodge No. 17 have died, and some have moved away from the city, so that today there are merely three of the \"Old Guard\" remaining.",
                "On November 14, 1889, a group of women presented the Lodge with a beautiful silk banner, and in 1893 the Lodge secured, through freewill contributions, two fine flags, which were dedicated at a social of the Lodge on May 25, 1893. In 1903, the ladies once more showed their interest in the Lodge by presenting it with two large flags of silk (the older ones were of wool), which were dedicated by the Supreme Vice-president of the Brotherhood on May 1, 1903.",
                "On many occasions at the conventions of the Danish Brotherhood, Lodge No. 17 has exerted considerable influence through its delegates for the furtherance of objectives of benefit to the organization. Mr. Edward Holm, the first president of the Lodge, was for several years the Supreme Auditor, and at the convention in Racine, Wisconsin in 1902 the delegate of the Lodge, Mr. Vald Kikkebusch, was elected Supreme Vice-president of the Brotherhood.",
                "Lodge No. 17 is also well represented in the central committee chosen by the Chicago lodges. The president of this committee is a member of Lodge No. 17, and one of the Lodge's most popular members is secretary of the united committee of the lodges, in charge of arrangements for the national festival in Riverview Park to be held on June 6. Lodge No. 17 has invariably occupied a prominent place among all the Danish societies, whenever the more important Danish undertakings were to be launched. It is unnecessary to go into details regarding this point.",
                "At various times, Danish societies have made efforts to secure their own halls. Lodge No. 17 was the first that succeeded in such an effort. On January 4, 1907, a committee was appointed to investigate the possibilities of a building for the Lodge. The committee....agreed to recommend the purchase of the building at 315-317 Hirsch Street. The price of the property was $3,500. The Lodge subsequently authorized the committee to negotiate the purchase, and the price was paid during the same year. ....During the summer the necessary alterations on the property were made, and on Sunday, October 27, 1907, the Lodge met in the new building for the first time, and the property was dedicated as the future home of the Lodge. The property cost the Lodge $8,000, including fixtures, etc., and it contains a large lodge hall with a number of smaller rooms for use by committees.",
                "The building is paying for itself through the renting of halls and rooms for various meetings, and will undoubtedly prove a good investment. The amount needed for the purchase was provided in part by the Lodge itself, and in part through the buying of shares by the members of the Lodge.",
                "Throughout its existence the Lodge has had many energetic members who have, in many ways, contributed to the growth of the organization."

The initiation fee is two dollars, which may be paid at the rate of twenty-five cents on admission and fifty cents for the following four months. These two dollars are paid back whenever a member moves from Chicago or wants to leave the society. If he becomes sick his benefit is five dollars a week for twenty-six weeks during the year. The aim of Enigheden is to lower the initiation fees which, in many other sick benefit societies are as high as eight or ten dollars, and this sum is never paid back. At the same time the society wants to have so low a weekly fee that even the poorest can afford to belong. None of the officers is paid.

                "The Danish Lutheran Children's Home in Chicago is a child of Trinity Church. At a church convention held in Chicago 1883 a discussion was brought up about the urgency and possibility of a Danish home for orphans and neglected children of Danish parentage. Though much interest was manifested, nothing was done until, as it seemed, the Lord himself laid the children at the door of the church. A mother of four children was dying. Rev. A. S. Nielsen, Pastor of Trinity Danish Lutheran Church had been called and was standing at her bedside with her poor husband. She turned to the pastor and said: \"I am ready to die, but, my poor children!\"--The pastor replied: \"If your hour of departure has come, that you may go home to be with the Lord, then, my dear, go with peace, your children shall be provided for with God's help.",
                "Thus it came to pass, that the thought of a Danish Children's Home was materialized. When the mother died, Rev. Nielsen went to some of his parishioners and collected $15.00, rented a small apartment and engaged a former Diaconess from Copenhagen, Elisabeth Nyrup, as matron. August 12th, 1884 the four children were admitted and the Danish Lutheran Children's Home started, Trinity congregation was the main support of the Home; the following year at the synodical meeting at Clinton, Iowa, the Home was accepted by the Synod of the Danish Ev. Lutheran Church in America. A frame house on Maplewood Avenue, near Milwaukee Avenue, was bought and dedicated as Danish Children's Home. 1905 a new substantial building was erected on Evergreen Avenue. 1915 an addition was built to make room for more children. The pastor of Trinity Church has already been, the director and superintendent of the Home and managed its affairs together with two laymen, elected by the congregation. An Auxiliary Board of ladies have for twenty years taken care of \"Tag Day\" collections. The first matrons: Magdalene Sorensen, Mrs. Martha Olsen, Mrs. Ane Hansen and the present, Miss Cristense Holm, had all been selected from Trinity Church. Several legacies have been received from former members of the congregation $14,000.00 were left to the Home by bookkeeper Jens Nielsen 1914 and $14,000.00 by H. P. Larsen 1924 and $10,000.00 by Walter Mathiesen 1932 and several smaller.",
                "Several hundred children have benefited of the hospitality of the Home during the past 49 years, some have stayed there from 10-12 years and many now spread all over the country and have their own good homes and families, off and on they visit the Home, and it is a pleasure to hear how thankful they are for the good time they spent in the Home and for the good influence and kindness they received.",
                "A summer camp is now contemplated near Greenville, Michigan for the children for many years they were placed with farmers in the adjacent states during summer vacation, but of late it has been difficult to place them. The Children's Home has been recipient of many gifts during past years from its many friends all over the country and has been a blessing for many children and we hope it may continue its good work for many years to come.",
                "The Danish Lutheran Church in America has for 20 years supported two other Danish Children's Home, one in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, which was closed a few years ago and one at Tyler, Minnesota.",
                "The United Danish Lutheran Church maintains two Children's Homes, one in Elkhorn, Iowa, and the other Waupeca, Wisconsin: may these also become a blessing to many who are in need of such good Christian Homes!"

At the close of 1935, there were 52 residents; thirty-three women and nineteen men. This included three married couples.",

In connection with the care and service rendered to these residents, we wish to express our deep appreciation to the nurse and matron for their vigilance and faithful discharge of their duties.",

Our monthly birthday parties continue to be well attended, and with the improved transportation facilities to Norwood Park, we feel assured of a steady increase of visitors at these parties, appreciated by all concerned, and may we extend our appreciation to each participant and contributor towards its success.",

                "On Wednesday, August 21, most of our old folks attended the annual picnic of the American Automobile Association, which was held at Lincoln Park, where a most pleasant day was enjoyed, and refreshments were served. A fine program of all kinds of entertainment was also given. Eleven automobiles were placed at our disposal for transportation of our residents.",

Mr. O. W. Kollner is also entitled to thanks and appreciation for service rendered in the line of electrical work.",
                "To Mr. Ove Knudsen and his fine staff of players, who staged the play of \"Noddebo Praestegaard\" at our Home on Sunday, March 3, we are greatly indebted. This play was enjoyed immensely. Pastor Videbeck and his fine mixed chorus from Ebenezer Church have also visited the Home. Pastor Enok Mortensen showed pictures from Denmark, and Reverend A. Freeman Kunz is conducting regular religious service at the Home. To these ladies and gentlemen we express our appreciation and thanks for their various contributions to the welfare and enjoyment of our residents.",
                "Our new dishwashing machine, donated by Mr. J. C. Nielsen, is undoubtedly the most valuable improvement made this year, and aside from sanitation, has placed our kitchen on a higher degree of efficiency to the benefit of all concerned.",
                "We have received a number of plants from Mr. Schousboe, florist. From the Danish-American Athletic Club we have received a bust of Hans Christian Andersen, which adorns a corner of our parlor.",
                "Due to the fact that the date of our Christmas party fell on a Monday, the attendance was not so great this year, as the previous year; however, we feel it was a great success. Pastor Andersen conducted the service prior to the serving of the Christmas dinner and subsequent party.",
                "The fine condition in which we find our Home is a credit to Mr. and Mrs. Arent Nielsen, and their devoted interest and care for our old folks is commendable. During the past year Mr. Arent Nielsen has washed and painted many of the rooms, and thus has effected a great saving. To our nurses and girls we extend our appreciation for faithful service, and to our residents we likewise extend appreciation for their willingness to assist in the work in and outside the Home.",

                "Our receipts for Tag Day held May 5, 1935, amounted to $840.82. We would like to take this opportunity to thank our workers for their untiring efforts and co-operation last year, and we hope our Committee will receive the same support for our next Tag Day, to be held May 4, 1936.",

                "The strength of any organization is dependent upon the moral and financial support given by its membership, and the very same statement applies to our Home. For the past six years our membership has declined to a point where we feel it a matter of duty to call your attention to the fact. As our Home is not self-sustaining, we must depend on the moral and financial support of our membership, and we feel confident that you fully realize the value and benefit of numerical strength and we therefore appeal to you as a member to do your share towards increasing our membership and adopt the slogan, \"Every member get a member\", We shall be glad to furnish you with application blanks upon request. The membership dues are $3 and up, per year. We feel confident that there are many charitable-minded Danes in Chicago that would be more than willing to join our society, if only approached.",

                "As a historical record I should like to mention here the names of these ladies who did the pioneer work for the Danish Old People's home in Chicago of which we are justly proud. They were: Mrs. Emma Thorsen, Mrs. C. Hanson, Mrs. C. Pfeiffer, Mrs. Alf. Rose, Mrs. Chr. Alstrup, Mrs. John P. Hansen, Mrs. George Sandier, Mrs. H. Skov, Mrs. Geo. Olsen, Mrs. Ed. Mikkelsen, Miss Mary Thorsen and Miss Wilhelmina Pfeiffer.",
                "At the end of 1891 there was a membership of 178 and the first 1,000 Dollar mortgage was bought.",
                "Eleven years later the Society was in a position to purchase a house with two acres of ground in Norwood Park and eleven men and women were admitted at once.",
                "In October, 1914 the corner stone of a new larger building was laid, but it soon proved to be too small and a wing was added in 1925, making room for 56 old people.",
                "Since then the Home has been filled to overflowing and at the present time there are forty waiting to be admitted.",
                "Today the Society for the Danish Old People's Home have more than 600 members, but it is not nearly enough when we consider the number of Danes in Chicago and we must complete the work started so gallantly forty-two years ago.",
                "At the Christmas celebration this year at the Home an Old Danish hymn was sung in which these words just suited that little circle of courageous women who started the movement for a Danish Old People's Home in Chicago, and it also fits the small group of Danish people in this city who can always be depended upon to help their aged countrymen and women.",
                "In this connection I want to say that we must not overlook the fact that we cannot keep on appealing to the same people to support the Home, We must help each other carry the load and as long as the Danish Old People's Home is not self-supporting there is work and to spare for all of us.",
                "Let us remember that to enjoy happiness is a great blessing, but to impart happiness to others is greater yet."

Then we were pushed over to one of the many booths, and in a short time we had a beautifully embroidered nightgown on the arm. Butcher Olsen showed us a basket overflowing with choice groceries. All for ten cents. We were foolish enough to give him half a dollar, whereupon on the butcher disappears with the whole amount leaving us with five unlucky numbers. Butchers should not be admitted to bazars. From the stage, Bank Director Hansen's young son spies us - Three for a quarter - just for you alone;, guaranteed to win - thank you! The wheel spins - but the Bank Director's son did not speak the truth.",

A gentleman in \"Harmonien's\" booth shouts so loud that he drowns out \"Holy Night\" from the Workingmen's Singing Society. The same gentleman takes, without the slightest compunction,our last forty-five cents. The wheel spins again. A sixteen year old boy with a Prince of Wales sweater wins a hand-embroidered apron. The nearby ladies smile at him jealously. The apron disappears under the sweater. In front of a large blackboard G.P. Jensen is scooping up nickles. Mr. Jensen does not shout so loud, but his black sparkling eyes draw customers to his booth. \"Five cents per vote - who is the colony's most popular lady or gentleman?\"",
                "We look at the blackboard: Martin Meisel and Claus Jensen are leading for the moment. A couple of gentlemen from the South Side pull out their \"Rolls,\" and Paul Wester and E.C. Bunck rise in \"cold cash popularity.\"",

Mrs. Bunck has been on the Housing Committee for many years, and Mr. Bunck served as president of the Home for three years during which period the membership doubled. He also served on the committee in charge of Danes of Chicago's participation in the World Exhibition in San Francisco, and in many other capacities he has been of service to his countrymen. When Mr. Bunck took the responsibility for a job we could always be sure the work would be done in a most conscientious manner.",

From Danish Old Peoples. Home a beautiful bouquet had arrived and was handed over by Mrs. James Henriksen, after she had made a fine speech. From the old people of the Home came a bouquet of roses and a poem by A. Thorsager. Mr. Bunck's employees presented a gigantic bouquet signifying the friendly relation which has always existed between Mr. Bunck and his employees.

                "p.4........We often hear complaints from many quarters about the lack of interest shown by our countrymen and women in the most worthy undertaking, and how difficult it is to obtain sufficient funds to properly care for our old ones at the \"Home,\" and now, when a committee is hard at work trying to raise enough money to enable them to build an addition to the home, one is met with almost insurmountable obstacles.",
                "I am willing to concede that the Danes' interest in this cause is rather lax; when we consider the number of Danes in Chicago as well as the large membership list of the Danish Old Peoples Home Society, the lack of interest is self-evident; but what can be the reason?",
                "First I must ask: Is it not the purpose to extend to all old and needy Danish - men and women help in their last years, remove their economic worries and try to make their last days as sunny and cheerful as conditions will permit - or is the Danish Old Peoples Home an Institution, where well-to-do Danes in a respectable manner and for a few hundred Dollars can place their patents, when \"the old folks\" are getting a little in the way in their respective homes?",
                "If the first part of my question is the aim and purpose of this institution, and this is carried out, I am certain, it will not be difficult to arouse the interest among the Danes, and receive both their moral and financial support, is, however, the opposite in the case, that the home is sort of a private institution for the privileged class, when they upon the payment of a nominal amount gain admission to the \"Home,\" it is easily understood why interested people keep aloof.",
                "It has been said that the Danish Old Peoples Home is no poor-house, where people who have not saved anything, but spent their money as fast as they made it, can be admitted, but a place for worthy respectable old Danes, true enough, worthiness should probably be considered, but it is possible to find competent unbiased judges, who possess the ability to draw the line between the worthy and the unworthy; it is doubtful if such judges were ever born.",
                "It is my opinion that the many of our countrymen and women, who are unable to support themselves and without any means, should be entitled to first option on any vacancies at the \"Home\" and not young able-bodied people as the case is today. I have been told there are those who have resided at the \"Home\" for seventeen years; even though they paid down three or four hundred Dollars at their admission, it does not mean much, as the first two years would have eaten this up, it is then up to the Society, its management and its committees to get busy and work early and late to raise means for the further support.",
                "In recent years we have had an \"Assisting or Help Committee,\" which has worked unselfishly with the few means at its disposal, it has taken many a heavy life and done a blessed work; out of every Dollar this committee handles, one-hundred cents go to the needy, there are no administrative expenses, every penny received is paid out. If this committee had more to work with, the applications for admission to the \"Home\" would be materially reduced, perhaps the proposed new building, which again will tax our donors, would not be necessary.",
                "It seems to me that this committee together with the house-committee chould work hand in hand, a better understanding and co-operation should be brought about, in order to do a more widespread and effective work. Perhaps the purchase of old dwellings in the Danish quarters which in turn could be turned over to the needy frequently, thereby, encourage self-help and at the same time avoid moving many old people from their known surroundings.",

All the good old standbys who never let the Home down, were there, and we also noticed many fresh additions, particularly pretty young ladies in festive attire.",
                "It seems to be the rule of this society to introduce in its program an English language number, which might well have been skipped last Wednesday without detracting from the enjoyment of the evening. On this occasion, Miss Olga Kargau, who undoubtedly is just as talented as she is pretty and charming, recited a scene from \"Madame X,\" which she was unable to put over, partly due to the peculiar acoustic conditions in the hall. This stage is not suitable for debutantes and inexperienced amateurs, and should be used only by seasoned, well trained actors, such as those of Dania's Dramatic Club of Racine. Their presentation of \"On the 3rd Floor,\" a farce depicting a succession of comical misunderstandings and cases of mistaken identities, was excellent, and the self-assurance and technique with which they played their roles was a revelation to Chicago Danes, whose own dramatic art is right now going through a period of decline. Let us hope and work for an early revival; we certainly have a long way to go before we can even begin to compare with our Racine brethren in the sphere of the drama.",

Dues amounted to $966.05; admission fees, $132; donations, $92.70; collections at meetings, where coffee and lunch was served, $101.85; interest on capital, $770.04.",
                "The total amount owned by the Society [Editor's note: The funds of the institution are collected and managed by a financial committee elected by the Danish Old People's Home Society, which is back of the institution.]",
                "has now reached the figure of $28,980.77. The Home has twenty inmates. There were fifteen applicants during the past year, so the proposal for expansion is justified. Plans for an addition to the buildings have been considered, but the means with which to carry such plans into effect should come from sources other than the present funds of the Society, it is thought. A Dane by the name of V. Michaelsen, president of the Illinois Paint Mfg. Co., who has been the heaviest annual contributor up to now, has donated $250 towards an addition.",
                "The executive committee elected by the Society has asked us to convey the information that, in the list of donations published in the report, the names of Madsen and Dalgaard, who donated the beautiful sign adorning the institution, have been forgotten."

The fine home in Norwood Park is adequate evidence of the success of her work.

When their work was made subject to severe criticism it was always Mrs. Thorsen who encouraged and pleaded for patience, so that the good work might continue. The death of Mrs. Thorsen will be mourned by the inmates of the home, as it will be by the little society which will continue the good work in her spirit, and in commemoration of her sacrifices.

Nor did he like the fact that there were to be no free rooms for poor old Danes that never had a chance in their life to save the two or three hundred dollars required for admission.

On an average, ten Danes have visited the Bureau every day for legal aid, advice, and help of all kinds. Every week thousands of other Danes have received advice in articles which the Bureau sends out through this and other Danish papers. Those who know this office and its mission agree as to its value and importance. Shall this work continue, or do the Danes wish the office closed?",
                "The Bureau's services, which have saved our countrymen thousands of dollars, have been furnished free of charge. A few hundred Danes have donated just about enough for postage. The balance of the $7,500 needed to keep the office going has been contributed by Americans.",

A hundred thousand immigrants arrive every year from Mexico, while the number of arrivals from Denmark is much smaller. Mexico has no information office. The directors of the Foreign Language Information Service have decided to open a Mexican Information Bureau and to finance this by abolishing the Danish office.",

                "Is the office worth so much money to the Danes in America? I, for one, think that it is. A simple proposal which was sent from this office to the Danish government saves $10 for every American citizen of Danish birth who takes a trip to Denmark, the amount which he formerly paid for his passport. It also saves him $10 more which it formerly cost to have the passport visaed. These savings will amount at least to $25,000 a year. The annual saving in cost of legal services and of other assistance furnished gratis by the Bureau may conservatively be estimated at another $25,000.",

                "Another of our important duties is to find missing persons. A detective bureau would usually charge $100 for one of these cases. The Danish Bureau has handled more than eight hundred and has traced and found more than half the missing persons. If this work was paid for at the regular rate, it would amount to more than it takes to keep the office in operation.",
                "George Fernstrom told me last week that the reason why the Bureau has received so little support from the Danes was that I was too modest and did not advertise what we were doing.",

The organization will function as a branch of St. Ausgar's Church, but membership will be open to people outside the church.

The committee hopes thus to lay the corner stone of a monument, as beautiful and noble as can be erected by any nation. All we Danes, who gather tomorrow, far from the coasts of our homeland, to revive the memory of our childhood home, its customs, its people and language, should be happy to do our share towards alleviating suffering among those of our countrymen who has been hit by sickness or other misfortune. We appeal to every Dane to make his contribution, large or small. None of us who will celebrate tomorrow know what the future has in store for us, but let us express our joy, by extending a helping hand to those that are less privileged. There are many of our countrymen in this great city fighting against odds. Let us help them! We will thereby make this day of festival doubly happy for ourselves. Let none of us be without that tag tomorrow! It will express our will and ability to help those who are losing out in the struggle for existence. Let us give what we can.",

After two sons had been born, he eloped to America (Chicago) with his wife's chambermaid. Of course he took with him the family jewels and whatever ready cash he could lay his hands upon.",
                "Shortly after his arrival in Chicago,he enlisted in the army, and fought in the Civil War. At the end of the war he returned to Chicago to find his wife, the erstwhile chambermaid, operating a brothel with fifty or sixty female inmates at an address on Calumet Avenue. Of course this was just the thing for the Baron--this becoming the proprietor of a brothel.",
                "He was later admitted to the police force, and still later promoted to sergeant. He took advantage of his promotion and robbed the treasury of the Chicago Police Department. Naturally Mayor Washburn had to remove the Baron from the city pay roll, but the Mayor got him a job at the stockyards as night watchman--what\"a come down\" for a royal majordomo and Knight of Dannebrog--where he for many years herded swine (sic). Years later he was admitted to the veterans home in Milwaukee, where he shot himself, three years ago.",
                "Last week the police found the body of a woman in the basement of a house on Calumet Avenue. The body was that of Mrs. Bartholin, the royal lady's ex-cham-bermaid, and the only son of the baron's marriage was the murderer. In today's paper we see that the son committed suicide in Riceville, Iowa, last night. So ends the career of the \"Danish Chicago Baron.\""

                "Statistics show that there are some thirty thousand Americans (this figure includes only citizens) of Danish birth in the State of Illinois. Immigration began as far back as 1840, and centered about Chicago, spreading northward as far as Kenosha, Wisconsin and southward as far as Dwight, Illinois.",
                "In Chicago, the Danish immigrants settled largely on the West Side, where they established themselves in distinct groups. Many engaged in business and succeeded well. Wherever they settled, the older generation rapidly established homes, churches, lodges, and schools. Many clung tenaciously to their mother tongue and their traditions, until, as they became familiar with American ways, some of their secular interests were absorbed by, and dissolved in, our national spirit. But their memories are generally very long.",
                "One Danish immigrant rose to the post of State Treasurer, another grew famous as one of the State's most distinguished distributors of foodstuffs. The younger generation (after 1880) also number many citizens of distinction, including bankers, physicians, teachers, lawyers, writers, etc., and men of affairs. Three became famous as musicians and composers. At least two were members of the State Legislature. Several served in the city and village governments.",
                "Our contingent of Danish origin brought to our State an innate honesty and integrity, coupled with a will to work hard for their homesteads according to principles which had stood the test of centuries. This tradition revealed itself in the fondness of the Danish immigrant for his native ways, food, speech, and amusements. Some notable choirs, active for upward of a half-century or longer, still cultivate old native songs.",
                "For many years, each Danish settlement celebrated the fifth of June, the anniversary of the adoption of the Danish constitution, as a day of rejoicing, but in later times the tendency has been to transfer the date of this festival to the fourth of July.",
                "Like other groups of foreign origin, the Danes in Illinois developed from the sixties onward a literature of their own, founded on American impressions of life and nature or embodying old memories. Poetry was plentifully published in the early Danish-American press and in a number of books. Hymns and the attendant sacred music continued to cheer and enliven the spirits of many men and women. Around 1880 there also developed a considerable activity in the field of drama. This activity, so largely dependent on personal initiative, still continues in the field of sports.",
                "The Dane is fond of arts and crafts, gymnastics, athletics, folk dancing, and other constructive amusements. Danish artisans were much in demand until the advent of the machine age. Much of the artistic decoration of our older mansions in and about Chicago was done by Danish skill. Danish servants were, and still are, at a premium.",
                "But the greatest contribution of the Danish immigrants, in Illinois and elsewhere, lies in their genius for homebuilding and development of sound units of farming. Acting under the time-honored practice that every farm should be left in a better state of cultivation than that in which it was received, the Danish farmer contingent has set a praiseworthy example for all time. Wherever a large and commodious barn building is found adjoining a modest dwelling, it is a safe guess that a Dane was responsible for the structure.",

Alighting from a street car at the corner of Western and North Avenues and walking westward, we found the window signs on both sides predominantly Danish. Saloons, of which there was one on every corner all the way to California Avenue, were all owned by Danes, employing Danish bartenders, Danish waitresses, and Danish janitors. Danish also were the customers who passed in and out, quenching their thirst. At its best the language spoken in these places was a wonderful mixture of English and Danish in all variations and dialects.",

The Danish mail-carriers have remained, however, but they do not carry so many letters with Danish stamps as before. It is the vividly colored Polish and Russian stamps which predominate.",
                "Of course many Danish businessmen are still to be found in that neighborhood, and there are also a great many Danish families. Likewise several Danish societies do still have their headquarters there; but the majority of Danes have left, going farther west and northwest, and with their departure the West North Avenue district has ceased to be a typical Danish settlement. The older Danish settlement at Milwaukee and Chicago Avenues has completely disappeared, even though you may happen to discover a Danish sign squeezed in between Jewish and Polish ones. And so the Danes are on the retreat again. Are they going to conquer new territory collectively, or will they remain dispersed?"

                "When I arrived here, together with my family in February, 1908, the Colony numbered seventeen families. The town, or settlement, at that time called Partridge, was located in Pine County, and was insignificant in appearance. The surrounding territory was covered with thousands of stubs and scattered underbrush, the pitiful remains of mighty forests, reminding the newcomer of the disastrous Hinkley fire which went over this section sometime during the Nineties, killing animals and people by the hundreds.",
                "But in the Spring of 1908, the settlement woke up to life, physically and spiritually. Twenty new families arrived and settled. Carpenters, builders and laborers did a rushing business during the summer, and before Fall, a great many new homes stood ready for occupation. A pretty new bungalow was dedicated to the minister of the settlement, Rev. H. C. Strandskov, who arrived in August. It was clear to all that the work started here was something which should not be stopped now.",
                "Five years have elapsed since then, a period rich with good memories, and characterized by rapid development. Progress has been made individually, and collectively. As an average of twenty families moved in and settled every year, so we are about six hundred Danes altogether now, and expect the traditional addition this year.",
                "What does the town of Askov look like now in 1913? There are two grocery stores, a hardware store, a well organized bank, a blacksmith shop, a sawmill, and two painting contractors. Even the station master is a Dane from the Chicago Southside. We have a fine, modern hotel managed by our friends, Mr. and Mrs. Olsen, also from Chicago's Southside. There are about ten families from Chicago, all apparently happy in their enjoyment of the country's peaceful way of living, so different from the noise and struggle in the big city. During the summer of 1911, a new and modern creamery was built. Our famous countryman, dairy expert, Carl Miller, from West Denmark,Wisconsin, is the manager. The farmers of Askov have their own cooperative feed store, and Mr. L. Masback has started a nursery.",
                "Much land around Askov is now in excellent shape. A mighty steam threshing machine has been traveling from farm to farm the last two seasons to take care of bumper crops, which is almost a tradition in Askov. Besides dairying and chicken farming, we have another important source of income, namely; potatoes. Unfortunately, the price on potatoes has been low this year, but we feel satisfied in knowing that people living in the city can afford to buy them. A fine, new school has been built. We have a male principal and three female teachers, all Danes. One of them teaches exclusively in Danish four months of the year, and one hour daily is dedicated to Danish as a regular subject throughout the season.",

So is a Young Peoples' Society carrying the beautiful name of \"The Forest Rose.\" Then we have a Farmers' Society, a Cooperative Insurance Society, a Sick and Benefit Society, a Brotherhood Lodge, and the Congregation, each serving its proper purpose for the blessing and benefit of the settlement.",

Are you dissatisfied with conditions in the big city, or are you suffering under the yoke of Capitalism? Come out in the country to live as free and independent citizens.",
                "Even very limited means will enable you to start on the road to independence. Here, you will have an opportunity to raise a family, healthy and happy, as is the ideal of every father and mother. Masons, carpenters, and laborers can get all the work they want. Of course, even if you have a trade, and depend on that for a living, everybody living in the country ought to have a few acres, say five or ten to cultivate. On such a little farm, there will be plenty to do during periods when nothing else is going on. Thus, your time is not wasted, but made into money.",
                "Prices on cut over land a few miles outside Askov range from $15 to $20 an acre.",
                "Cultivated land near the town is not cheap any more. However, there are five and ten acre lots near the town that can be bought at a reasonable price. A few farms, both large and small, situated close to town, are for sale because the owners want to return to Denmark and live in retirement.",

There are those who prefer to listen to a private party, rather than to land agents or banks, etc. I will be happy to respond to such inquiries from friends or from strangers. I shall strive to give the most impartial and accurate information possible. I consider myself in a position to do so, because I am not interested in the sale of land or in any other way financially connected with the development of Askov.\"",

For many years the society met in a building at the corner of La Salle Avenue and Kinzie Street, but the structure burned during the Great Fire. Everything burned except the protocol and a picture of the Danish King, Frederik VII. The society moved to Milwaukee Avenue.",

The society therefore sold the old building and built a new one on North Kedzie Avenue, near North Avenue. This building was finished in 1912 at a cost of more than $30,000. Dania now has 250 members; the club is open all day to members. Many well-known Danes have been presidents of the society; Henry Ockenholt, Charles L. Wilde, Carl Nielsen, Adolf Christensen, Emil C. Jorgensen, Charles Ryberg, J. C. Larsen (vice-president of the Security Bank) and lately Peder Kristensen. The treasurer is Ludvig M. Hoffenblad."

The Danish-American Association strives to unite, not to divide.",

                "It has been encouraging to watch the steadily growing interest in the Association of groups of the most varied types, and in this connection it may be mentioned that since the previous annual convention the Association has accepted seventy-one new shareholders. Of these, fifty-six were from America and fifteen from Denmark.",
                "The last annual convention voted to organize three district committees for New York, Chicago, and San Francisco. The chief task of these committees was to direct permanent subcommittees from the eastern, the middle western, and the western states, which, each by itself, might arrange meetings and lectures, and entertain the lectures on their tours throughout the United States. In addition the subcommittees were to arrange such socials or exhibitions as local societies might be unable or unwilling to undertake, or which might lie beyond the sphere of activity of such local groups.",
                "The composition of the Chicago district committee is as follows: Peter J. Noer, chairman; A. M. Petersen, secretary; Henry L. Hertz, Carl Antonsen, O. E. Agerbeck, Henry Ockenholt; Jens Fulsang, Magnus Holm, L. M. Hoffenblad, A. W. Hansen, Max Henius, ex officio members.",

Noer has died, and in his place Mr. Henry Ockenholt was elected chairman, while Mr. Charles Wilde has been made a member. Results of the work of the Chicago district committee are already apparent in the great festival at the Garrick Theater on February 21. It was decided that any surplus from this festival would be used for benevolent undertakings.",
                "The Chicago district committee further arranged for a most successful excursion to Racine, Wisconsin, on September 26, 1908. This excursion, however, can hardly be considered of more than local significance.",

                "A critical estimate of the Danish-American exchange of professors, as discussed in the press, considers this exchange as a greater success than was originally expected. The special committee, under the leadership of which this exchange had taken place, and in which the chairman, Professor Carl Lorentzen, had done much valuable work, has been dissolved. In the future this work will be conducted by the board of directors of the Association.",
                "The most important reasons for the proposed complete reorganization of the Danish-American Association have already been presented in the introduction to the present annual report, and, besides, have been extensively discussed with the shareholders in a circular sent to them. The chief reason for the proposal is to arrange for practical and reliable guarantees and conditions in order that the Association can devote itself to purely ideal objectives without depending in any way upon shareholders who, as the name implies, might expect financial returns from the activities of the Association. Another, and equally important, reason is the desire to make the Association as democratic as possible, in the conviction that this is an important factor if the Association is to be successful in its undertakings.",
                "The reorganization means, briefly, that the present Danish-American Association will be dissolved; that the shares will be absorbed, either at their present market value or by the granting of life memberships in the new organization to the shareholders, the shareholders to choose which method they prefer; that a new society be incorporated in place of the present one, under the same name, but without capital and shareholders and \"financial profits\", the members to pay an annual membership fee.",
                "The board of directors is strongly convinced that such reorganization is needed in order that the Association may attain its goal. The board has received much encouragement from the letters received from shareholders which indicate that the latter unanimously endorse the stand taken by the directors.",
                "The board of directors believes that the Association is on the right track, and that under a new and more democratic form of government it will be possible to take more fully into consideration the demands of the Danish-Americans, thereby moving always closer to the ideal which is our goal."

This is out of the question. It was decided, however, to buy a bar permit at $2.50, for every evening the bar is open. But liquor is not sold only at the bar; the janitor of Dania also sells liquor in the different club rooms. A committee was formed, consisting of Charles Ryberg, M. Houlberg, and Charles Wilde, to see what can be done when the renting of the bar expires on April 1, 1904. Most of the members are in favor of the idea that Dania take over the bar and get a license for the entire building."

                "In 1872 Henry L. Hertz arrived from Copenhagen. He immediately joined Dania, and in course of time he became very popular with everybody whom he came in contact with. His first activity was to remove the dissension within the society. In 1874 he brought Consul Emil Dreyer triumphantly back to the fold. From this time on Dreyer worked with renewed energy and determination, and his sudden death on his way back from Denmark in 1892 was a source of grief and regret to Dania. Henry L. Hertz himself became the soul of many movements in Dania, and thus it was he who first sounded the note for the acquisition of Dania's own building, and he was a powerful support to the committee with acquired the structure on Chicago Avenue.",
                "Old Hertz enjoyed an enviable career, which culminated in the great moment when the citizens of Illinois elected him to the office of State treasurer. For a number of years he was Dania's beloved honorary member until he also departed to join the old guard in the beyond.",
                "The great fire of 1871 gave Dania a setback. All the furniture, the bookcases, the ample library, the records, and the accounts were destroyed by the flames. Nothing was saved but Dania's banner and a picture of the Danish king, Frederick VII, which hangs on the wall of Dania Hall today. The man who rescued this bit of property was Niels Uhrenholdt. The election of a new board and a new set of officers, with Fritz Frantzen as president, George Hoffman as vice-president, C. Hansen as treasurer, and Carl Larsen as secretary, began a new chapter in Dania's history; the Society now entered upon a new era of prosperity. In 1864 Dania had collected quite a sum of money for the veterans of the Danish-German War, and a donation of money was sent to France after the war of 1870. Later a collection was taken to help the Danes who had lost everything in the destructive gale of 1872. Denmark sent a resolution of thanks to Dania for its efforts.",
                "In 1875, four years after the Chicago fire, Dania was quite propperous. It had 150 active members, of whom 100 belonged to the sick-benefit group, and the treasurer at that time reported $1,200 cash on hand. All the Danes in Chicago used to participate in every affair conducted by Dania; in those days it was quite an honor to be a member of the Society. And thanks to the work and the efforts of Niels Uhrenholdt, Dania is today an esteemed and flourishing Society. The by-laws for the sick-benefit group were passed on July 5, 1876, and the signature of Niels Uhrenholdt is followed by the names of Henry Hertz, Ludvig Hoffenglad, and many other pioneers. Niels Uhrenholdt is the uncle of Dr. Jenny Baun, the wife of the editor and educator Kristian Baun.",
                "In the same year, 1876, the \"Danish Veterans' Society\" was organized, which for a while hampered the growth of Dania. The old comrades of war, veterans of 1848 and of 1864, were excellent organizers and under-stood how to attract the best elements of all the other societies. There was a great deal of enthusiasm on the Northwest Side, when the Danish veterans marched in full uniform with officers on horseback, led by a large band.",
                "Dania grew and became stronger year by year, and its growth continued during the great immigration of the eighties and the nineties. Among the old-timers who are still alive we find under the date of August 6, 1867, Lauritz Olesen, Pedar Kristensen, Charles Wilde, Herman Hansen, Mike Mickaelsen, Martin Houlberg, Peter Bjerrehus, Emil Jorgensen, Fred C. Jensen, Joseph Jensen, and Sophus Mathiesen.",
                "At the close of the eighties the membership was 200, and in the beginning of the nineties it reached 250. The trustees at that time invested the funds in good securities, and the investments aggregated thousands of dollars. The idea of Dania's owning its building became more and more popular, and on December 17, 1891, the secretary, Pedar Kristensen, read the resolutions by which a separate committee received authority to purchase the property at 249-251 West Chicago Avenue, designated as lots 12,13, and 14 in block 42 of Ogden's addition to Chicago, and the buildings thereon. The price was $23,000, and the initial payment was $5,000. The rest was covered by the guarantee of the members and the support of a few wealthy men in the colony. The Society took possession on May 1, 1892. The first meeting at the new location took place on July 2 of the same year. The dedication festivities occurred on July 23, 1892; nearly every Dane in Chicago attended."

                "This Society was the rendezvous of Danish immigrants in Chicago at a time when this country was undergoing a great disturbance. Nobody knew what might result from the Civil War. Great political and economic changes were taking place, property values and business capital were in danger, and the prospects for work for the coming winter were uncertain. All this must have aroused a feeling of sadness in Danish hearts on that cold November day when the men who organized Dania shook hands as comrades here in a foreign land. And perhaps this was the very reason why Dana or Dania took strong enough root to survive all the difficult periods through which it passed in the years which followed.",
                "Dania received its first and perhaps its most severe setback a few years after its formation. Dr. N. P. Petersen, George Hoffman, and Emil Dreyer had been among its leaders, and in its first years Dania already knew factional strife. Half the members wanted to preserve the original name, Dana, while others, with Dreyer in the lead, wanted to change the name to Dania. John Foster had removed to Naperville, and he was seldom present at the meetings; after a while others of the original members withdrew from the Society. Dania itself removed nearly every month to a new location, until finally the meetings were held in private houses. It was George Hoffman who saved the day in Dania's first crisis. He gathered in his house all the members whom it was possible to reach. Everybody had to contribute according to his means for the purpose of renting a meeting place again and continuing the Society. And it was a success. At the same meeting it was decided to incorporate the Society under the name \"Dania\".",
                "After this meeting in 1865 it appears that Dania again increased in size and in strength. A number of the city's prominent Danes joined it, but several of the grave Copenhagen sailors among its organizers were lost.",
                "Johan Foster himself could not recognize his own organization. He never approved of the change of name, not even when Dania in 1869 made him the first honorary member of the Society did he find real consolation. The old giant, Dania's father, spent his last years in Milwaukee, where he died on October 9, 1877. On his gravestone we might write to-day:",
                "Dania owes all to you,",
                "Johan Foster. Rest in peace.",
                "In the progressive year of 1865 it was proposed to organize a sick-benefit department, probably the first Danish sick-benefit group in America. It began to function in the year following, and it became of great importance to Dania. At the same time several committees were busy arranging for burial plots [for members of the Society] in Graceland Cemetery, but they were not successful in this undertaking. In the midst of all these activities Dania founded its library, and Niels Uhrenholdt was elected library steward. In the summer of 1865 the first outing \"by land and water\" took place, a trip by boat to Winnetka. In previous years Dania had held its picnics in \"the sandbanks\" [probably the Indiana or Illinois dunes] and in the forests along the Des Plaines River.",
                "In the year following, 1866, the famous \"immigrant committee\" was organized, which, as was usual with all Dania's committees, worked far beyond what might have been expected of its limited membership. The committee was to assist immigrants in various ways. It acted as an employment agency, and an advisory council and it conducted an evening school where the immigrant received instruction in English. The first teacher in this evening school was John Anderson, the publisher of Skandinaven. In the records of 1865 and 1866 it will be noted that Dania established its regular theater, which has functioned through the years with varying success. There the best-known Danish farces and comedies, with Eva Sallins, Johan Foster, and Niels Jensen among the actors, were staged. And after the Society's festive nights the women's auxiliary treated members and guests to Aebleskiver [a Danish cake] and coffee. There is nothing in the records to inform us, when the ladies' auxiliary was established, but the dusty old minutes inform us that Dania's ladies took part in the building of the Society with their usual helpful and co-operative spirit.",
                "When Dania had reached its first moment of success, the first celebration to commemorate the signing of the Danish constitution was held, which met with an enthusiastic response from Danes in Chicago and outside. But again the sun, for a time, went below the horizon of the four-year-old Society.",
                "A matter entirely alien to the Society's activities caused the decline of that period. The Danish [consul], Dr. N. P. Petersen, had come to the end of his earthly career, and it became a question of some importance among the Danes as to who should fill the vacancy left by Dr. Petersen. Emil Dreyer was a candidate and was eventually appointed Danish consul in Chicago. But Dreyer complained that the Society had not supported him, and he withdrew from its ranks together with many of his partisans. The membership sank below fifty, and even the strong sick-benefit department tottered. But among the faithful few the meetings were continued. The chorus was founded in 1870, and its voice was heard as late as 1894, when the singing society \"Harmonien\" had established itself on a solid basis. Many of the original members of Harmonien were old members of Dania, which may be the reason why the two societies were always united with the strongest ties of friendship and sympathy. Dania's \"Gun Club\" is first mentioned in 1871, and it terminated its existence in 1891, when its zealous champions left it to found the present Danish Sharpshooters, a club which has enjoyed exceptional success."

We also want to stress the importance of that historic Sunday, the twenty-third of November, 1862, which will forever remain sacred and unforgettable to the people of Dania.",
                "The material at hand is quite voluminous. Many letters from immigrants have been a valuable source of information, and a quantity of data from old newspaper files has been used.",
                "In the early sixties, only a few hundred Danes had settled in the primitive Chicago of that day. Nor were the surroundings very attractive. Chicago in early years was a bottomless mud-hole, poorly lighted and far from beautiful. The East was still considered the section to find work and go into business; and it was the great desire of the immigrants who came west to reach the Pacific coast, where gold again had been discovered. But a number of Danish immigrants had nevertheless built their houses and established their businesses in our growing metropolis, and among these pioneer heroes we find the founders of the Dania Society.",
                "Two great waves of immigration in the fifties and sixties brought a couple of hundred artisans to Chicago, and the newcomers, as those Danes had done who were already here, settled in the vicinity of La Salle and Kinzie Streets, where rents were low, and the district was not overcrowded. In a short time, Kinzie Street, from La Salle Street all the way out to the bridge over the river at what is now Grand Avenue, had taken on quite a Danish appearance. The dilapidated buildings were soon repaired and remodeled; the window sills were covered with blooming plants; and small elegant stores with well-tended gardens and summerhouses in front, shining knockers, and white-scoured steps, told the Americans here where the Danes of Chicago lived.",
                "The best known of all the inns in the vicinity was the Kinzie Inn, at the corner of Kinzie and LaSalle Streets. It was the meeting place of a great many Danes, who received their mail there and would sit in the long winter evenings and read Foster's newspaper, a two-month-old issue of Berlinsske Tidende, from the homeland.",
                "Johan Foster, whose name will be mentioned first in the annals of Dania, was already at that time a well-known and important man. He was called a Norwegian, a Schleswig-Holsteiner, a German, and a Dutchman, but he was born in Copenhagen, as were the majority of the founders of Dania. It was Johan Foster who announced that first important meeting at the Kinzie Inn on November 23, 1862. He carefully selected the men who with him signed the resolution,--\"we are today founding a Danish society in Chicago, and that the name of said society shall be the Dania Society.\"",
                "It is regrettable that the accounts of this great moment are meager and few. It was committed to writing that a mailbox should be provided for, as well as some decks of cards, and some spittoons. Space must have been valuable to the secretary, since this is practically all that is written in his minutes. These first records would have been valuable and precious if the deceased first secretary, P.C. Petersen, could have recorded the thoughts and sentiments which came to life on this memorable evening in the smoky little room on Kinzie Street, and we would gladly have undertaken to include them in these brief notes.",
                "The first members of Dania, besides Johan Foster and P.C. Petersen, were E. Sallins, Peter Allen [the first Dane to settle in Chicago], Brodt Hagen, Hoffman, Peder Moller, Christoffer Johnsen (Dania's first treasurer), Bendixen, Skov, T. Moller, Mikkelsen, J. S. Petersen, H. V. Hansen, and Consul N. P. Petersen. Brodt Hagen and Hoffman were charged with the task of writing Dania's constitution. The initiation fee was two dollars, and the monthly dues were fifty cents. A meeting was to be held every Sunday, and a general membership meeting with election of officers was to occur every three months. And the last decision of that first meeting was that the second meeting, on the following Sunday, was to be held in the later famous Wilken's Cellar on LaSalle Street."

                "Dania had all its laws and bylaws revised about thirteen years ago, on November 23, 1862. Doctor J. Foster, who is now in Milwaukee, and a few other Danes, started a Danish brotherhood. The organization had its difficulties at first, but on February 16 Dania was given its first charter by the State of Illinois. The idea was to give expression to Danish social life; a Danish library and a sick benefit association were other objectives. Dues were to be small. The men who accomplished this,finally, certainly deserve a great deal of credit.",
                "Last year one thousand dollars was paid to its sick members. This sum was large enough to give members full reimbursement for their losses during illness. There is a rule that every time a member dies, the entire membership must pay fifty cents each. As Dania has four hundred members, two hundred dollars is thus collected, which is certainly a considerable sum.",
                "All the laws of Dania show a real feeling of brotherhood. After the Great Fire of October 9, 1871, Dania lost all its furniture, but the club was so strong that the loss was quickly replaced. The greatest loss was a beautiful banner donated by the Danish women. The club secured new rooms at 17 Milwaukee Avenue, where there is a large hall.",
                "After a short time the membership became so large, that it was necessary to enlarge the quarters. The reading room was made into a very cozy lounge, with beautiful rugs on the floor, and works of real art on the walls. In the center of the room is a pretty table made of hazelwood. In the same room you will find the library, containing several hundred books. In the corners of the room, easy chairs and lounges are along the sunny side of the walls. Two large gas chandeliers hang from the ceiling. In the billiard room, the members must pay five cents per game.",
                "Dania hopes to get its own home. Dania also has a singing society. Last of all, it should be mentioned that Dania works to assist newly arrived immigrants in securing positions."

Volguarz) approaches and asks the people to stop drinking while he begs the saloonkeeper to give up his barbarian trade. But as all his eloquence is in vain; an entire army of praying ladies comes to the rescue of McCarthy. But the saloonkeeper seems to understand his business. Supported by his gallant guests he offers the ladies a sample drink. So great was his power of persuasion, so enticing were the filled glasses that none of the ladies could resist. Many other glasses followed the sample drink. McCarthy drinks to the health of the saloonkeeper and general gaiety reigns amongst the fanatics."

The Dania has a sick benefit fund to which each member contributes six dollars annually. If he is sick he receives twelve dollars a week. This sick benefit fund, due to wise administration, is in the best financial condition. In case of the death of a member, the Club pays the funeral expenses and the widow receives two hundred dollars. The assets of the Club consist of $3,000 in cash, the Club building, and a priceless library. In the social world the Club is famous for its masquerades. It has its own choir with thirty singers, and a debating club where political and other questions are debated twice a week. Here the temperance question was discussed, and decided according to a liberal point of view. Here preparations were made for the Danish mass meeting in the Aurora Turner Hall, where the Danish citizens joined unanimously in our movement."

The Danes made great preparations, decorating their cars with Danish and American Flags in order to participate in the parade scheduled to leave Dania Hall about 12 o'clock. At the time of departure there were about sixty automobiles in the parade, which was less than expected. Furthermore, for some reason or other, the parade split up into several links so it was hard for the judges to make fair comparisons and award the prizes to those who really deserved them. However, we believe the judges solved the problems, and following are the winners:",

But the things that brought these days to be near and dear to Americans and Danes, grew out of the same causes - the same events - the same social and political conditions. These dates evidence the culmination of similar struggles of people of different nationality against tyranny- against age old wrongs - and mark steps of the people in their progress for greater freedom and a better government.",

Denmark has undoubtedly, in attaining its present standard of a free and enlightened government, drunk deep from the well of freedom and liberal government of these United States. But also, likewise, the United States has gained much from the men and women Denmark has sent here to become among its pioneers in developing the resources of this country and from their efforts to become a part of its best and most earnest citizens. It is recognized as a fact that you have brought with you to this country the elements of good citizenship. You have brought with you habits of industry, frugality and love for your fellow man. You bring with you respect for law and order. In the last generation you have shown the world many evidences of progress and development, which not only the United States, but nearly every country on the globe, has endeavored to follow and adopt. In recognition of your progress it will be remembered that the United States caused its representative to Denmark, Dr. Maurice Egan, to travel throughout the Southern States to advise and inform the people of those states of how you had made so marvelous a success from the cultivation of your lands - the organization and distribution of your products, and today you are the school house of the world in teaching successful agriculture.",

What was it that made them leave the well-cultivated lanes of old England; the cozy homes they loved so much, all that was dear to them, and come here and suffer the indescribable hardships of pioneer life? The answer to this question is indeed a wonderful story of devotion to truth, to freedom of conscience, of untold courage.",

Rather than submit to the king's will, these men and women of deep convictions decided to leave England. First they sailed to Holland (1607 and 1608), to the cities of Amsterdam and Leyden, but they found that it was hard to make a living there and especially that their children were forgetting the English language, their mother tongue. For these reasons they decided to go to America, where they hoped to lay the foundation of a country all their own, where they might enjoy both religious and national freedom. Because of this going from place to place, those who started for America were called the Pilgrims. That is why we sing \"Land of the Pilgrims Pride.\"",

The name of the ship on which they sailed was called the \"Mayflower,\" a comparativly small sailboat. For nine terrible weeks the Pilgrims were tossed about on the waves of the Atlantic, until they finally landed near Cape Cod on December 21, 1620. It was here they decided to settle. It was a bitter cold day and all that there was to welcome the brave little band were woods laden with thick snow and the cold north wind howling through the branches. Only the bravest could stand the hardships of the first days. Fortunately, the Pilgrims were the bravest of the brave, fired with a passion for freedom. They were not discouraged by the difficulties, however great, but set to work to build their homes in which they were determined to live for the rest of their lives.",

In the fall they were finally able to gather in their crops and celebrate their first victory over the wilderness. The cornerstone of their new country had been laid. They knew now that they would have a home of their own, where they could enjoy freedom of conscience and remain true to their national ideals.",
                "It is no wonder that they decided to celebrate this event, and that they set aside a few days during which they were to feast, to rejoice, and to give thanks. The first Thanksgiving Day was a great event. Even the Indians were invited. They had helped the settlers during the hard winter by selling them corn and furs; they had shown them how to plant the corn and were great friends of the white men. They brought five deer for the feast and entertained the settlers with wild Indian games. The white men in turn gave the Indians exhibitions of military tactics and evolutions.",
                "In 1623, another day of feasting and thanksgiving was held. Every year after that a day was set aside as Thanksgiving Day, until now, in our time, the last Thursday of November is set aside as a national holiday. On this day it is well to think of the work and sacrifices of those brave souls who have gone before us, and to resolve to keep it intact for all days to come, even if we have to make as great sacrifices as the great founders of America."

Before 9:00 A.M. several hundred had gathered at the hall of D.B.S. #17; a group from Racine, Wis., mustering two-hundred enthusiastic celebrants.",

The intense work and its far-reaching influence is self-evident since it even brought delegations from Racine, Kenosha, Waupaca, and Stoughton, Wis., Woodstock, St. Charles and Dwight, Ill. Davenport, Iowa, and Lincoln Nebraska, too were represented by prominent Danes.",

The picnic grove of the park was properly decorated for the occasion. Special banners had been placed indicating space reserved for each organization attending in a body as well as for family groups. The entire Hans Nielsens Orchestra was gathered in the Band Stand and an almost continuous program of music made its soothing way to the outer-most corners of the big park. The check-up on the attendance showed that the record of ten years ago had been more than attained. This year recorded 7000 paid adult admissions, plus free admissions including hundreds of children and guests of honor. A conservative estimate places the total attendance at over 10,000. Among the honored guests of the day was the aged Peter Balle who as a boy of seventeen rode with the cavalcade that demanded and received from Frederick VII, constitutional freedom.",

Deneen spoke feelingly of the contributions of the Danish-American group to the cultural and economical life throughout state and country. In addition to the speakers platform, there were grand stands for the singers. Especially pleasing was the sight and sound of a choir of eighty girls in white with red sashes occupying the stand at one side ,while a combined chorus of Danish singing societies filled the opposite stand.",

Toasts and speeches were the order of the evening. The speakers were Mr. Hertz, Carl Antonsen, Niels Juul, Col. Neble, Jas. Skallerup. The banquet and service arranged by the management of Riverview left a great deal to be desired as neither the food nor efficiency in serving were of Danish quality and efficiency. Criticism, plentiful and sharp, was therefore handed out in no uncertain terms. Even the music, secured by the Park management, was lacking in life and color.",

The blessings of liberty would seem to have been allotted among the nations in accordance with the rule that \"the last shall be first and the first shall be last.\" The oldest written constitution now in force we find in the New World, while the youngest, generally speaking, are found in the Old World. The organic laws of our republic and the oldest states antedate all others, and next in seniority ranks the constitution of Norway. The constitution of Denmark, adopted fifty years ago, is one of the oldest now in vogue in Europe.",
                "Denmark's organic law of 1849 is generally regarded as a gift from a king to his people. In one sense this is true. Frederick VII was a man of the people with his ear close to the popular heart. The liberty wave of 1848 had swept Denmark in its onward course, and though no disturbances had followed, a restless longing for liberty had been left in the Danish heart. The king knew the unspoken wish of the nation, and announced his readiness to surrender his power and to accept a constitution to be framed by a constituent assembly representing the people. A burst of popular enthusiasm greeted this act of unprecedented royal generosity and wise statesmanship. Rebellion in the duchies had already roused the national sentiment of the people, and now their patriotic enthusiasm gathered fresh strength from the promise of constitutional liberty.",
                "Thus was Danish liberty born--under the high pressure of popular sentiment. The new organic law soon received its baptism in blood through glorious victories for the Danish army over the German forces on the border. But during the depressing days after the unequal struggle of 1864, the constitution of 1849 was mutilated; in its present form it presents a rather singular compromise between popular and vested rights. But the remarkable progress of the Danish people during the last fifty years insures a complete restoration of the constitution of 1849, sooner or lsater. It is this constitution that lives in the hearts of the people; it is the birth of this splendid charter of liberty that they celebrate today and tomorrow.",
                "Denmark's \"Liberty Day\" has a beautiful setting--the fresh bright glory of early summer. It carries a suggestion of stately beach forests arrayed in their best; blooming meadows rich in tender fragrances and cheerful crowds of people in holiday attire. And when the eventful days of 1849 are portrayed in speech and song to the enthusiastic multitudes, out of the mist of the past, splitting the black clouds of intervening years, appear the kindly features of the beloved king who scorned power that he might give liberty to his people--the only king whom history will place among the champions of popular liberty, the only king whose memory will grow dearer to the nation as liberty shall advance in the land. Yes, tomorrow every Dane in Chicago will turn out, singing in the bright sunlight the songs of old. We shall hear, \"Vift stolt paa Kodon's bolge\" (Wave Proudly o'er Kodon's Seas), and we shall dream of dear old Denmark."

Slavery was removed as a condition of labor; arrangements were made to secure everyone a bit of the social cake. Everyone was permitted an education; hence the celebration on June 5. Every county, every city or village is permitted to conduct its own political business, since it is permitted to hold elections for its own officials. We hope and pray that our old fatherland will always celebrate the Fifth of June.",

                "Two years, almost, after the founding of the Danish Brotherhood in America, the idea of founding a Danish Sisterhood in America, as an independent association for the purpose of aiding and assisting Danish women in America after the principles of the Brotherhood, began to take form.",
                "The initiative came from Mrs. Kirstine Hemmingsen, born Jan. 30, 1840, in Roholte county, Sealand, Denmark and married to a member of the Danish Brotherhood, Niels Hemmingsen, Negaunee, Mich. This founder of our association, Mrs. Kirstine Hemmingsen, worked so incessantly and energetic, that she finally, at her home in Negaunee on November 21, 1883, could gather enough interested parties to found the first lodge of the Danish Sisterhood of America.",
                "December 15th of the same year the first meeting of our association took place in the home of the founder. When it became apparent that there were not enough ladies present to fill the offices necessary, it was moved, seconded and unanimously adopted as a rule: that members of the brotherhood were permitted to join the sisterhood--which, however, was not kept very strictly, as will be shown. We therefore see the following members at the first meeting of the first lodge of D. S. S. in America, held January 8, 1884, viz.: Niels Hemmingsen, supreme president; Catherine Jensen, president; Karen Hansen, vice-president; Agnes Johnson, secretary, and Kirstine Henningsen, treasurer.",
                "The Sisterhood thrived in the succeeding years. Members of the Danish Brotherhood joined the baby association in increasing numbers, and Danish women became interested in steadily increasing degree. Of the passive members, several became members of the supreme lodge and held offices in the same; for instance, L. L. Ries, who served as our supreme treasurer from 1887 to 1908; Chr. Boyshou, who served as our first supreme secretary; and Ludwig M. Hoffenblad, that true friend of D. S. S., as supreme secretary, loyal and true, never tiring in his efforts for the welfare of the sisters. It is thanks to the work of such \"passive members\" of the D. S. S. that we today have reached out present impregnable position.",
                "The first convention of D. S. S. in America took place January, 1887, in Burlington, Ia. The following officers were elected: J. Chr. Eskildsen, supreme president; Chr. Boyshou, supreme vice-president; Ludwig M. Hoffenblad, supreme secretary, and L. L. Ries, supreme treasurer. The second convention of D. S. S. in America was held in Chicago, Ill., 1890, where all officers of the supreme lodge were unanimously re-elected and supplemented with our first supreme trustees of the Sisterhood, namely: Mrs. Henriette Capion and Mrs. Sophie Nicolaisen.",
                "The following year saw a heavy struggle for us to maintain the Sisterhood during years of hardship and strenuous work, but also years of faithful adherence to the principles of the Danish Sisterhood and the Brotherhood as well. The victory was won finally, when the Danish Brotherhood in America, at its convention in Racine, Wis., in October, 1902, resolved to aid and assist the Danish Sisterhood in America with all its might. Thanks to this resolution of the brothers, we now had smoother sailing, so that we, at our 25th anniversary celebration in October, 1908, could show a membership of 5,190 members, of 106 lodges, spread over the entire U. S. A. We could also show that during the 25 years we had paid out insurance to the amount of $5,135, 916.00, and help to sick members of $93,000.00, and aided poor members and their families to the amount of $12,000.00. During these years we had held conventions in Burlington, Ia. (1887), Chicago (1890), Racine, Wis. (1899), Omaha, Neb. (1897), Marinette, Wis. (1904).",
                "The convention is Council Bluffs, Ia. (1910), saw the election of only active members as supreme officers. The passive members (the men) had served D. S. S. well and were given a rousing exit.",
                "The officers then elected were: Hansine Madsen, supreme president; Sophie Lauritzen, supreme vice-president; Caroline Nielsen, supreme secretary; Louise Rasmussen, supreme treasurer; Mette Jensen, Bothilde Hansen and Hanne Jorgensen, supreme trustees.",
                "The Convention in Kansas City, No.(1928), saw the application for a new charter for the D. S. S. in America, which at that time changed from an association for life insurance to an association for funeral and sick-benefit. Mr. Julius Andersen, supreme vice-president of D. B. S. in America, assisted us in this work, so that we in 1929 had our new charter and were ready to adopt new members on our new charter.",
                "The later years have seen a steady growth of membership in D. S. S., so much so that we today, in the year of our Lord, Nineteen Hundred and Thirty-three, in the fiftieth year of our existence, can show a membership of 7,248 members in 142 lodges. We have paid out in funeral benefit $960,801.75 and paid sick-benefit to members and their families.",
                "The following are our supreme officers today, viz.: Supreme ex-president, Elisa Tonder, Lodge No. 6; supreme president, Mrs. Adele Hauge, Lodge No. 16; supreme vice-president, Marie Mogensen, Lodge No. 68; supreme secretary, Mrs. Anna Eddy, Lodge No. 139; supreme treasurer, Louise Rasmussen, Lodge No. 50, and supreme trustees: Ellen Hojrup (L. 23), Marie Hansen (L. 22), and Lona Holt (L. 13).",
                "The lean years this world is passing through have also put their mark on D. S. S. in America, but we are not afraid of them; we look to the future with anticipation of a still greater success for our association, because we know and believe, that truth always must conquer, and that the work we are doing-\"helping human beings to help themselves\"- never is and never will be done in vain."

Over the improvised pulpit is a significant picture of \"Jesus, the Man,\" painted by an artist in the congregation. Between forty and fifty men and women were there to greet me, and when I say greet, I mean just that. There was a distinct cordiality and democracy about the group, which is sometimes lacking in our churches.",

They are enthusiastic about the possibilities of a liberal religious center in that section of Chicago. Most of them are Danes, Norwegians, and Germans who had broken away from conservative orthodox churches when they felt that there was no religious organization to meet their needs; and this the Church of the Brotherhood supplies. I have yet to see a better example of single-hearted and single-minded concentration to the spiritual and social needs of a group than Mr. and Mrs. Helsing are demonstrating here. The group has responded loyally and as generously as they can under the existing circumstances. Many of them are unemployed, or are working part time, and this makes all the more necessary, a center of inspiration and hope, which the church provides."

                "Danish emigrants arriving here fifty years ago very quickly felt the lack of churches. At home the church was an institution, a part of the landscape. It had been there always and had been the old folks' spiritual refuge as far back as one could remember.",
                "Emigrants of half a century ago preserved closer ties with their native land than do emigrants nowadays. Modern people are more or less cosmopolitan in their behavior, which by most of them is considered an advantage. That may be a matter of doubt, however. We have too many \"jacks of all trades but masters of none\". Before very long these emigrants of early days began to resume their traditional religious activity. To begin with, they received aid from home, but soon they were able to hold their own and even to accumulate a surplus with which to help others.",
                "It is often difficult for people accustomed to look at the church as a state institution to feel at home as members of a privately owned church. At home the church was maintained, and the minister's salary paid in good times or bad, while over here good or bad times are reflected very clearly on the church.",
                "In spite of the fact that only a minority of Danish emigrants have been actively interested in church work the results obtained are by no means negligible. Moreover, most of the churches have been built while the builders themselves were hard at work establishing their own homes and positions in life.",
                "Of course there are Danes who are members of churches of other denominations than the Lutheran, and a great many particularly in the cities, have joined American churches. Some belong to Norwegian churches. However, the majority of Danes interested in religious activity belong to the Lutheran organizations, of which there are two, namely, \"The Danish Church\" and \"The United Church\".",
                "The Danish Church has a combined staff of fifty-eight ministers. During recent years several ministers have left for Denmark. There was a shortage of ministers at home, and over here quite a few difficulties arose on account of the use of two languages.",
                "At present there are thirty-seven ministers in Denmark who once served in the Danish Church in the United States. Most of them are candidates in theology from the University of Copenhagen who accepted positions with the Danish Church in the United States for longer or shorter periods without the intention of emigrating. The Danish Church consists of ninety-eight community churches spread from coast to coast. The total value of church property is $831,334.",
                "The total membership is hard to determine because in some cases the memberships are held by single persons and in others by families numbering two or more. We calculate that there are 6,315 paid-up memberships, but there are actually about 20,000 people who belong to the Church. In addition to active members and their families there are those who attend church services and make use of the spiritual conveniences only occasionally.",
                "The Danish Church has always adhered to the open-door policy, and we doubt that there is any considerable number of Danes who have not at least once in their lives benefited directly by the presence of a Danish church.",
                "The Danes are somewhat shy in their religious affairs. We are far from being so aggressive as are the Americans. We let people come and go as they please because we do not believe in high pressure and persuasive methods. However, it would probably do no harm for the members to advertise the program a little more than they do.",
                "A lot of people outside the Church would like to become members if somebody would ask them, and no doubt they would get a lot of satisfaction out of being active in the good work.",
                "Young people's societies affiliated with the churches have a total approximately of 2,235 members. Churches affiliated with the Danish Church had a total expenditure of $151,227 last year, of which $22,213 went for operating expenses. Besides its church work the Danish Church operates a school in Des Moines, Iowa, an Old People's Home, and several Children's Homes.",
                "The United Church is a younger organization with a total membership of 27,715. The total property value is $1,770,950. Its staff of ministers, missionaries, and professors numbers 132, thus outnumbering the 58 ministers of the Danish Church to quite an extent. Sixteen ministers who previously served in the United Church are now in Denmark. The total income of the United Church was $117,771 last year. Of this amount $70,732 went for operating expenses. Local expenses such as ministers' salaries, maintenance, and alterations, were $225,000. The United Church maintains a school in Blair, Nebraska, and several Old People's Homes and Children's Homes. The Danish Church pays the salary of a missionary in Santalistan, and the United Church has missionaries in Japan, among the Mormons, and among the Indians.",
                "These figures may serve as information about the activity of [the two] Danish churches in the United States. There are no other Danish organizations in this country comparable to these in extent of membership and in activity, and the blessings brought about by this work should not be measured in figures either.",

In reality we are no further today in our school-work, than we were twenty-five years ago, and without a policy or plans.\"",

An other idea is to introduce religious teaching with the Public Schools. It is a pity to know, that in Chicago 4/5 of the children grow up entirely devoid of any moral or religious ideas or teachings, consequently 85% of our criminals are young people.\"",
                "I spoke particularly on the Gary-System of Schools. Lastly I spoke on the ever increasing demand for Ministers and a university education. What our church needs today is leaders of more than average ability. I touched upon the question for the reason, that Pastor Hoibjerg and his group were opposed to this idea in preference to the free education of ministers at our theological schools.\"",

In other words, the Pioneer takes sides with the ultra conservative and orthodox elements who have tried for a long time to expel the minister because he is too honest to play the hypocrite. Centuries ago a minister of that sort would have been burned without mercy. There were those who were burned for lesser offenses than the one of which the Reverend Mr. Konow is guilty. In our days stupidity and sentimentality are limiting the efforts to that of getting him out of the Church. But not even that is an easy matter, because the Reverend Mr. Konow refuses to resign on the ground that modern Christianity is something else and more than that of perpetuating old tales and faith in miracles conceived at a time when people did not know better; and there are indications that his superiors inside the Church are of the same opinion, inasmuch as no steps have yet been taken to expel him.",

Oh well! Would it perhaps be better for the Reverend Mr. Konow to join hands with the Pioneer in its more \"honorable\" occupation of selling stock in a questionable gold mining enterprise to unsuspecting people of its own nationality?"

The biblical questions of so much importance that brought fully one hundred clergymen and lay delegates from nearly every Danish Lutheran Church in the United States to Chicago, that they might confer upon the subject, and settle the dispute of two years' standing, once for all, was found to be too great to be disposed of in the space of one week. It was a matter of a split in the Lutheran synod or a surrender of one of the two parties. Neither has happened. Even Mr. Jeroild, the editor of a Danish paper, who accused two ministers of rationalism, could not be made to retract, and all the committee could do was to ask him to give reasons for his statements before the newly elected synodical government at the next annual meeting in September. Instead of settling the question at issue a new constitution was accepted, and if theological controversies occur under this new government, they will be settled by the heads of the church. The new government will be composed of two ministers and three laymen, who will rule the synod. A.S.Nielsen was President of the former church government."

Opposite sides in the dispute are taken by T.H.Helvig, and C.Vig, leading professors in the seminary. That this controversy might be disposed of, a special meeting was held yesterday at the Danish Trinity Church at Bickerdike and West Superior Streets. The meeting was attended by noted Danish Divines from different parts of the Northwest as well as by numerous laymen. The meeting opened yesterday morning with prayer by the pastor of the church, the Rev. A.S. Neilson, who is also President of the Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church Association of North America.",

They are Americans, not so much because they have bought cheap land in this new world, as because they have found freedom. Denmark would be openly in the war if the fate of Rumania, Serbia, and Belgium did not stare the Danes blankly in the face. It can not be allowed that the unity of the different nationalities be broken because of slander such as the above. We can not have racial or national prejudices at this time."

At the second meeting, held June 12, in the new hall, 63 West Huron Street, eight new members were admitted. It was also decided to have a library consisting of both Danish and English literature.

In the early part of 1892 the Society moved into its own home at 1214 Irving Avenue. On September 24 of the same year an evening school was started. Rasmus Mortensen was made principal of this school. In 1891 the Society had fifty-two members.",

On June 12, 1892, the Society met in a new and larger building--Wabansia Hall. In this building many interesting open forums, round table discussions, and book reviews were held.

The object is to provide a place where clean cut Danish youth can find a home with wholesome environment, where they may obtain a clean room and good food at the lowest possible cost.

                "Statistics show that there are about 30,000 Americans of Danish birth in the State of Illinois. Immigration began as far back as about 1840, centered about Chicago and spread from there northward as far as Kenosha, Wisconsin, and southward to Dwight.",
                "In Chicago, the Danish immigrants settled largely on the West Side, where they established themselves in distinct groups. Many engaged in business and succeeded well. Wherever they settled, the older generation rapidly established homes, churches, lodges and schools, and many clung tenaciously to their mother-tongue and their traditions until, as they became familiar with American ways, some of their secular interests were absorbed by, and dissolved in, our national spirit. But their memories generally are very long.",
                "One Danish immigrant rose to the post of State Treasurer; another grew famous as one of the States' most distinguished distributors of food stuffs.",
                "The younger generation (after 1880) also number many citizens of distinction as bankers, physicians, teachers, manufacturers, and men of affairs. Three became famous as musicians and composers. At least two were members of the State legislature. Several served in the city and village governments.",
                "Our contingent of Danish origin brought to our State an innate honesty and intergrity, coupled with a will to work hard for their homestead on principles which had stood the tests of centuries. This tradition showed itself in the fondness of the Danish immigrant for his native ways, foods, speech, and diversions. Some notable choirs, active for upward of a half-century or longer, still cultivate old home songs. For many years, each Danish settlement celebrated June 5, the anniversary of the Danish constitution, as a day of celebration, but in later times the tendency has been to transfer these festivals to July 4.",
                "Like other groups of foreign origin, the Danes in Illinois developed from the Sisties a literature of their own, founded on American impressions of life and nature or embodying old memories. Poetry flourished in the earlier Danish-American press and in a number of books. Hymns and their attendant sacred music continued to cheer and animate many men and women. From about 1880 there also grew up some considerable dramatic activity, which still continues in sports, dependent on personal initiative.",
                "The Dane is fond of arts and craft, gymnastics, athletics, folk-dances, and other constructive diversion. Danish artisans were much in demand until the advent of the machine age. Much artistic decoration of our older mansions in and about Chicago was done by Danish skill. Danish servants always were, and still are, at a premium.",
                "But the greatest contribution of the Danish immigrants, in Illinois and elsewhere, lies in their genius for homebuilding and the development of sound units of farming. Acting under the time-honored demand that every farm should be left in a better state of cultivation that it was received, the Danish farmer contingent has set a praiseworthy example for all time. Wherever a large and commodious barn building is found in conjunction with a modest dwelling, it is a safe guess that a Dane made the beginning.",
                "A grandson of one of the early Danish pastors in Illinois was chosen for the distinguished office of editing the great history of the United States of Henry Adams.",
                "An immigrant of the first generation is largely responsible for the initial development of our park system and many private estates.",
                "Another American of Danish birth, who came to Illinois fifty years ago, founded the only American national park in a foreign country--in Denmark--dedicated to the honor of our hospitable country of adoption."

Although this represents a reduction of fifty per cent or more, there is absolutely no protest against this greatly reduced annual quota, or against its distribution on the basis of two per cent of the United States census of 1890.

The first impression one receives from the book is that it is very dry and tiring, but upon analyzing and comparing the different tables, much valuable information and interpretation is received into everything concerning immigration. Of particular interest are the tables showing the emigrants' vocation, profession and trade; as well as the tables showing when these people settled down. The following is a resume of what was found.",
                "The first table shows in what professions the Scandinavian immigrants are to be found. We are unable to show figures for each of the Scandinavian countries, as the Bureau of Emigration places Danes, Norwegian and Swedes under one heading -\"Scandinavians.\"",
                "The grand total of Scandinavian immigrants is 40,978 or 5.8% of the total immigration from all countries, 706,896.",
                "Of the 41,000 Scandinavian immigrants, 2,014 had scholastic education, 11,684 were tradesmen and professional men, such as bakers, timber-construction workers, etc.; 16,984 were farmers, agricultural workers and laborers, domestics, etc.; 10,296 had no occupation. This last figure includes minors, wives and all others who did not work for wages.",
                "The most surprising of the above figures is the low percentage of Scandinavians listed under \"no occupation\". They amount to less than 25% of the Scandinavian emigrant, while the average for all other emigrant-groups is 40%. No other race or nationality has as low a percentage. For the British emigrants the figure is 47%, Germans 37%, Jews 53%, Italians 32%, Poles 47%, The Finns are next to the Scandinavians with 29%.",
                "As the number of the non-vocational Scandinavians is so low, it follows that the number of \"vocationals\" are proportionately much higher than other nationalities. As an example we will consider emigrants with university or technical school education, of which 2,014 were admitted to the United States. This is over 8% of the total Scandinavian emigrants. The number of emigrants with higher education from all other countries is 24,778. As the Scandinavian emigration amounts to only 5.8% of the total U.S. emigration, it shows that the Scandinavian countries have sent us over 24% more people of higher education than all other nations. More than half of the Scandinavians of this group are either civil or electrical engineers, - 692 and 573 respectively. This is 15% of the emigrants of this kind, which proves that the Scandinavian countries, in proportion to the number of emigrants, have given the United States three times as many engineers as other countries.",
                "Of other Scandinavian emigrants arriving here during 1924 and belonging to the latter group are thirty-three architects, fifty-one scientists, librarians and ninety-eight teachers.",

                "One is from a farmer by the name of Abel, who thinks that \"the emigrants are for the greater part people who have made themselves impossible at home, and who do not like to work.\" This man Abel is chairman of the board of directors of Danish Land, and we wonder what kind of society it can be that will place such a narrow-minded person as one of its top officers. The statement is thoughtless, irresponsible nonsense to say the least.",

He goes on to say that Danes who settle in America do not seem to care for the mother-land in the manner that,for instance, Greeks and Italians do.",
                "It might do Mr. Westenholtz some good to read the little book The Danish-born American, which was published last year. It would give him an idea of the deep affection which the emigrated Danes have for the country of their birth, and what they have done during the past generations to maintain the spiritual connection with homeland and preserve their Danish cultural heritage.",
                "It is right that we do not imitate the Greeks and Italians, who, in most cases, only stay here for a few years, trying to scrape together as much money as possible. We settle here, make our homes here, and take pride in being good citizens of our adopted country, and for doing so, we are being discredited by people of Mr. Westenholtz's type. Fortunately, many leading Danes, such as Ambassador Molkte, Professor Rovsing, Johan Skjoldborg, and others, take another view.",
                "The industrialist is a very wealthy man of the type that are unable to appreciate any other values than the dollar. He, therefore, speaks contemptuously of the Rebild Park (Translator's note: The Rebild Park is a gift to Denmark from Danish-Americans) as \"a microscopical national gift which is a good measuring stick for what the emigrated Danes can do.\" This is in contrast to Mr. Dalgas, who stated that \"thanks to the generosity of Dr. Henius and like-minded Danish-Americans, the park is laid out and will be preserved as a silent but living witness of the magnificence of the desolate heath.\"",

The soup served in third class was full of maggots. The food, fish, and meat were such that it was impossible to eat. The result was that the minister had to buy bread from the baker and good food from the chef in the kitchen. But the prices were such that the whole family was half starved when they arrived at Copenhagen. The minister did not have money enough to buy sufficient food for his wife and children. No wonder that he asks the Line to tell the truth to prospective travelers, or to give better service to its many customers."

It drags the good name of all the Danish-Americans through a mire of selfishness, and tries to efface every vestige of their sense of obligation and love to and for their mother country, and would have every thought and act which are of those feelings promote nothing but designs for selfish gains. It pictures the conditions of Danish-Americans as a Dante's Inferno, where each feeds on another, and squalor and misery is just desert for heartless intercourse.

                "In fact, Norwegians discovered Greenland more than a thousand years ago. They started a settlement on the southwest coast of that vast continent which later became extinct. Renewed Greenland ventures in the Seventeenth Century originated fully as much in Denmark as in Norway. The Rev. Hans Egede did not forget the formality of first going to Denmark for the purpose of obtaining appointment from the king as a missionary, and after fifteen years of devoted labor among the Eskimos, he returned and was rewarded the title of Bishop of Greenland, and became teacher at a newly erected Greenland seminary in Copenhagen.",
                "The entire administration of Greenland's affairs was then, as later on, centered in Copenhagen, and if at the treaty of Kiel, Greenland remained Danish territory just because of a diplomatic ruse, it is certainly a most peculiar fact that the Norwegian Storthing seven years later, in 1821, renounced every claim upon Denmark pertaining to the dissolution of the unions. By later treaty and a declaration of 1856, Norway recognized the Danish trading monopoly absolutely without reservation. Several treaties between Denmark and other countries involve the same recognition. The United States, when taking the Virgin Islands in 1916, expressly sanctioned Danish sovereignty over the whole of Greenland, and England, France, Sweden, and other powers have done likewise.",
                "Really, hardly any Norwegian had any idea of disputing Danish sovereignty over Greenland until twelve years ago when Danish authorities found it necessary to intercede against Norwegian sealers, whose reckless methods threatened the very existence of seals not only on the east coast, but also, as the seals are migratory, on the west coast of Greenland. Subsequently, in 1924, a treaty regulating sealing, fishing, and hunting was concluded between Denmark and Norway, it being tacitly understood that the sovereignty situation would remain unchanged until the expiration of this treaty in 1944.",
                "Then suddenly in 1930, the Norwegian government conferred a police mandate over its subjects in east Greenland upon the leader of a fishing expedition. The Danish Government immediately protested against this provocative step, and while this matter was still pending last summer, some Norwegian sealers raised the Norwegian flag near Mackenzie Bay and declared the territory occupied. This trespassing being officially sanctioned by Norway, the Danish Government having for years in theory and practice devoted itself to internationalism, pacifism, and disarmament had no other recourse than to bring action against the brother country before the World Court at The Hague.",

                "A deep pessimism spread over Denmark after the War of 1864, when the country lost one of her most valuable provinces to Germany--North Schleswig. The nation went through a period of profound despair, and the people seemed most inclined to give up all hope for the future. If it had not been for the deepseated conviction in one single individual of the mission of Denmark as a nation, and his implicit faith in the Danish people and their future, Denmark might today have been an impoverished and highly insignificant country, not worthy of mention in the society of nations.",
                "That man was the educator and reformer, Bishop N. F. S. Grundtvig. He instilled hope into a nation possessed by gloom and despair, and today Denmark is one of the most prosperous countries in Europe. Bishop Grundtvig's methods were educational. He established people's high schools [Translator's note: government subsidized colleges] all over the country which the sons and daughters of farmers attended. In these schools stress was laid upon national history and culture. He instilled in his pupils national pride, and taught them the value of labor. Through these schools, which are unique in character, Grundtvig awakened the youth of Denmark intellectually and spiritually and fitted them for great tasks. He implanted mutual trust and helpfulness in the young Danish farmer, and out of their living together in the high schools, developed a spirit of working together, the spirit which lies at the root of the widespread and internationally known Danish co-operative movement.",
                "The first co-operative dairy was established in 1881, and today there are more than 1,400 co-operative dairies in Denmark. A co-operative dairy is usually started by a group of farmers who contribute to its erection, and pledge themselves to supply the milk from a certain number of cows. When the building is completed a trained dairyman is placed at the head of the dairy. The dairy is immediately linked up with an expert butter association, controlled by the farmers, and as soon as the dairy has started, its products join the stream of butter, which is exported to England, Germany, and other countries every day of the year. England has for many years been the chief customer of Danish agricultural products and still is.",
                "When the Danish farmers had achieved success in co-operative butter production, and raised their butter to a standard quality so that it was considered the best butter in the world, they saw in the traditional English breakfast bacon a new field for their products. They began to raise hogs, and using the same methods employed in the establishment of co-operative dairies, they now began to establish co-operative packing houses. Today there are about sixty large co-operative packing houses in Denmark, and ninety per cent of the swine butchered in Denmark, are dressed in the co-operative packing houses. In 1924 more than three million swine were killed and exported to the English market. Some of the largest packing houses killed more than one hundred thousand swine in a year. The farmers who are members or share holders in the co-operative packing houses deliver their swine on certain days of the week, and are paid current prices. Each member has one vote in the management of the co-operative. Nobody has more than one vote.",
                "The co-operatives are managed by experienced men, paid by the farmers. The manager is responsible to all members for the management of the business. He has to be in close contact with the European marketing conditions, and must notify the farmers about different demands from the buyers, demands for heavier or lighter hogs, etc. Likewise he must keep in touch with new methods of combating diseases and inform the farmers of this.",
                "Once a year, on the day of the general meeting, the surplus or net profit is divided and paid out through one of the banks. This is paid out in cash and received personally by the farmer. Each year shows an increase in the surplus. Besides being paid for his hogs according to the world market prices, the Danish farmers receive a profit out of the packing house of which he is part owner. His market is always secure, and he is always entitled to the highest prices obtainable.",
                "In more recent years the Danish farmers have concentrated on another important article on the English breakfast table--eggs. Co-operative egg collecting societies were established in several places in the country, each society covering a certain district. At each of these places the eggs are carefully examined, dated, numbered, and packed to be exported to England. Millions of eggs are exported each year. Being packed in specially designed boxes, the eggs are fresh, when they reach the English customer, and newlaid eggs are in great demand in the large English centers.",
                "By a very shrewd system of classification and marketing, the packing houses can trace each of the millions of eggs handled annually to the producer, who runs a great risk of being excluded from the co-operative society if he is responsible for sending in eggs that are not fresh. In the buildings of these egg collecting societies are great tanks, where millions of eggs can be preserved for months and thrown on the British market when the eggs supplied by other countries are scarce. In thirty years, from 1881 to 1912, the value of the exports of Danish agricultural products increased from twelve million dollars to one hundred and twenty-five million dollars. In 1928 the sum was $434,700,000, and it has been steadily increasing since. There are now three hundred thousand small farmers in Denmark. In 1922 2,544,000 tons of wheat, rye, barley, and mixed grains were raised from three million acres.",
                "As may be expected, the Danish farmer has also learned the great advantage in co-operative import. Large co-operative concerns buy corn and forage, including oil coke, from abroad. Before the war, 1,700,000 tons of oil coke were bought annually. Likewise agricultural machinery and implements are bought by cooperative associations, so that the individual farmer reaps the advantages through wholesale buying. The Danish farmers have also established hundreds of co-operative retail stores, mostly grocery stores, which are supplied with goods manufactured in their own factories or imported by their co-operative association. In all departments of life the Danish farmer has seen the advantage of co-operative efforts.",
                "The co-operative associations have representatives in all the larger European countries and in the United States, who investigate marketing conditions and report upon them month by month. The Danish government pays large sums to agricultural experts who experiment with the newest methods beneficial to the farmers. As soon as new methods have proved their worth, the Danish farmer is quick to adopt them. He uses all discoveries which are to his own advantage, and he is always on the alert for any new improvement.",
                "The Danish farmer is self-reliant and rich in initiative. He feels himself a member of the whole movement, and feels the responsibility he holds as contributing to the success of the movement. He has a world outlook, knowing that his success is dependent on the equality of his products. He is, with few, rare exceptions, a man of education, and farmers have often held important positions in the government.",
                "He often has a library of his own. He is alive to all the questions of the day, and each Danish village has an assembly hall where, in the fall and winter months, prominent speakers give lectures on important subjects. He sends his sons and daughters to the people's high schools that he attended in his youth, and they are very early impressed with the importance of the movement and the high place it holds in the life of their nation.",
                "Many of the young men attend argicultural high schools, and when they start out to farm for themselves they possess an intimate knowledge of scientific farming methods and of the intricacies of the marketing system of the co-operative movement, and they are well qualified to join the ranks of those men who are not inaptly called \"the best farmers in the world\"."

                "When the new Danish Parliament assembles in October, the coalition Labor-Radical Government, headed by Theodore Stauning, veteran Socialist leader, will evidently insist upon immediate action making disarmament something tangible in Denmark. Since the coalition has seventy-seven deputies in the Lower House (sixty-one Socialists and sixteen Radicals), against an opposition of seventy-one, composed of forty-three Agrarians, twenty-five Conservatives, and three Land Taxers, and since the Last three are expected to support the disarmament proposal, Premier Stauning will have clearer sailing than he did in 1926, when his government was wrecked on the question of increasing unemployment benefits and a small capital levy after its disarmament bill had already been put through the Lower House.",
                "One argument used by opponents of the plan to save about $10,000,000 a year to the Danish taxpayers by substituting a sort of glorified police force for the existing army and navy, is the contention that, even if little Denmark wanted to disarm, she would not be allowed to do so by the big powers, because of her important geographical position in relation to keeping open the entrance to the Baltic Sea in time of war.",
                "But this point lost a great deal of its weight when Ramsay MacDonald, soon after being named British Prime Minister last June, when asked by a representative of a European Socialist paper what he thought about the Stauning plan, replied that he always had insisted that it was foolishness for a tiny nation to waste money on miniature armies and navies which would not amount to anything in a real war. This statement is being used by the Danish Socialists to reinforce their demand for quick action by Parliament.",

In the great and small military States the militarists are already at work to cross with the help of the Danish militarists, in a press campaign, the clearly expressed will of the Danish people. There is a majority of about 100,000 votes for disarmament. International disarmament is still awaited ten years after the establishment of the League of Nations. The great majority of the Danish population has declared by its vote that it can no longer wait for others and bear a burden of millions year after year for the sake of maintaining a military apparatus which all experts have declared to be futile.",
                "\"The disarmament proposals, which will again be adopted by the Lower House before the end of this year, provide for the following new arrangements.",

                "\"The new institutions will be subordinated to the Prime Minister. The War and Marine Ministries will be abolished. The fortifications will be dismantled. The general obligatory military service will be done away with. All men over twenty years of age will be registered every year. Those who do not wish to be trained in the frontier police or the marine must inform the authorities. From the remaining men fit for service, the necessary number for training (1,600 men) will be drawn each year. Voluntary military bodies are forbidden.",
                "\"The combined strength of the frontier police will be about 13,000 men. The State marine will be composed as follows: Six ships of not more than eight thousand tons in all, twenty-four ships of not more than thirty-six hundred tons in all, some mine and depot ships and twelve cutters. The yearly payments for both institutions will be reduced from fifty to sixty million crowns to seventeen million.\"",

Much has been said and written about the agony of longing they have suffered, and their inability to ignore the feeling that tied them to the homeland. Only earnestness of purpose and hard work along the lines leading from the doorsteps of our childhood homes outward can calm these feelings.",
                "\"Every emigrant of conscientious purpose will remain honest with himself. Therefore, he will always remember what he owes the country where he was born, equipped and trained to fill a place of responsibility.",
                "\"As more and more emigrants left and became citizens of countries, far off and widely separated, this feeling of connection with the mother country became more apparent, and the idea of giving it visible expression was conceived. A group of Danish born Americans founded the Rebild Park, now recognized by all as a rallying place for Americans born in Denmark. It is only natural that the World War strenghtened the relation between the mother country and her emigrated sons and daughters.",
                "\"In this spirit the Memorial Park outside the city of Aarhus was laid out for the purpose of preserving the memory of Danes whose accomplishments in foreign countries have been recognized as important to civilization and human progress, and also to express our sympathy with those men of Danish extraction who served and died in the World War.",
                "\"This 'Hill of Memories,'in beautiful Sondermarken outside Copenhagen,is commemorating the emigrants as a type constituting a group numbering hundreds of thousands of individuals. It is our token of gratitude and a symbol of the love we feel for our homeland, and besides, it is meant to preserve the memory of thousands who left and never returned.",
                "\"Many are the plans and suggestions that have been submitted as to what the definite purpose of this memorial should be. Location chosen, landscaping and purpose agreed upon is the combined result of successful co-operation. As it appears today, ready to be dedicated by King Christian on behalf of the Danish nation, it represents a gift to Denmark made by Danish emigrants from all corners of the world.",

I know that in spite of marked differences of opinions, and various degrees of social accomplishments, we do heartily agree with each other when we gather to celebrate our precious memories.",

We trust that the symbolic pieces of art adorning this spot will appeal to the hearts of young and old, in such a way as to make them understand that art is a true and symbolic expression of the spirit in which the voluntary contributions to this cause have poured in.\""

Ever so often a proposal to restrict this evil by means of legislation pops up. We have a tremendous faith in laws in this country, you know. The law ought to make the boundaries absolutely air tight, we think, so that nobody would escape. But still the lawmakers do make mistakes, and consequently a dense fog of hypocricy enshrouds the whole issue.",
                "The constitution prohibits American citizens employed by the government to wear honorary decorations conferred on them by the governments of foreign countries, unless a special permit from Congress is obtained. The identical state of affairs is prevalent in other countries, however, only with the exception that it would be the ruler of the respective country who would grant a permit, not a congress.",
                "Now we ought to make it so that it would be impossible for any American citizen to accept foreign tokens of honor without violating some law, sponsors of the movement maintain: We should display our distinct contempt for the old world's gewgaws, they say.",

If we don t support the idea in one way, we do in some other way. You will not find very many grown-ups in this country who do not possess some sort of a uniform or regalia which to wear at special occasions. Few are the ones who do not use their buttonhole for some sort of decoration, or at least would like to.",

Students have their fraternities, and are decorating themselves with jewel studded insignia.",
                "It isn't men only who love to decorate themselves. The women proudly wear their Eastern Star and Red Cross medals as tokens of appreciation for their work of knitting socks for the soldiers; the trade unions have their insignia, etc. It does not at all appear like tokens of honor are disregarded.",
                "And titles! We've gone so far as to have a title called \"Imperial Wizard\". We surely have the set-up that will show who of us amount to something and how much. Did you ever hear the story about the nigger who was late for work one morning and offered the excuse that he had attended a meeting in the lodge the preceding night where the brothers had a lovely time installing officers. He himself had been granted the title of \"The Supreme Ruler of the \"Universe;\" but that was a minor position, however.",
                "An attempt to chase the honor and title evil out the front door will cause it to enter through the back door in disguised form which in reality is the same thing. As a matter of fact the evil proves to satisfy a need, or rather a very natural human want. At any rate the custom has been popular as far back as our history goes. Every time it was abolished it has promptly reappeared.",
                "In France it was abolished with the fall of the kings; but it re-appeared in the Republic which has its Academy Order, its Legion of Honor, its Medal of Honor, Medal of Merit and Cross of War, (Croix de Guerre) all instituted to satisfy man's natural want and need for official recognition when of service to humanity in general, and the public demand for means of showing appreciation.",
                "We all want to be recognized in some way or other; some are satisfied with money only, others strive to obtain power and others again enjoy plain public appreciation.",

The Medal of Honor was instituted in 1861 and was the only medal to be had in the United States for a long time, excepting the silver or golden medal for life saving which Congress is authorized to grant.",
                "After the World War a number of new orders and medals were instituted, the best known of which is \"The Distinguished Service Cross, \" instituted 1918.",
                "Of course, such medals are predominently used as tokens of appreciation for heroic deeds for which a war is opportune.",

                "Heroisen cannot be appreciated in terms of money, or at least we do not feel it can or should be.",
                "To my knowledge the American army and navy have now sixteen different kinds of honorary decorations, while Civil Service still has but one, the medal for life saving. But there are a number of other medals of merit and honor available for scientists, explorers, etc., people who can't be blamed for being more interested in public recognition than the rest of us. On the contrary they generally consider the cause more important than the reward.",
                "Honorary lodges have been instrumental in the struggle for world progress and many important achievements can be attributed to the pshycological effect of their functions. They should not be regarded as undemocratic unless our conception of democracy is that of a uniform mob suppressed to the lowest standard.",
                "Of course, it can be misused like everything else. None of man's creations are perfect.",
                "Honorary orders are commonly used as tokens of courtesy between nations, and when conferred to a person the honor is meant for the position he holds; for instance, the leader of a social movement would be the recipient of a token of honor granted in consideration of the benefits brought about by the movement. Or a modal can be used to signify an important historic event.",
                "To become a member of the French Academy no doubt would convey the feeling to the person concerned that be belongs among the leaders of the nation's spiritual life. Such feeling may make a person happy and humble at the same time.",
                "Where honor leads to arrogance, it has hit a wrong place; but aside from that I do not at all believe that a proposal to do away with medals and the like is an expression for any particular democratic point of view. The benefits obtained through the encouragements honorary decorations have caused, outweighs the negative results by far. There is hardly any reason to call a halt.",

                "There should hardly be any doubt as to whether or not Danish-Americans should learn Danish; if properly considered most people will agree, that it is of great importance in many fields of endeavor. In short \"that is the answer.\"",
                "Whom shall we include as Danish-Americans?",
                "The best answer to this would be: All Danish immigrants, all born of Danish parents or near ancestors.",
                "Many Danish immigrants are possibly of the opinion, that they do not need to learn Danish; that they have learned it already, and now they want to learn as much English as possible. This is altogether natural and proper. The trouble is a foreign born has difficulty in learning English to perfection, particularly so if he throws his mother-tongue overboard. Some people seem to think that it is a waste of time for a native Dane to learn Danish in America; but this is far from being the case. We can assume as a matter of course, that it is well nigh impossible to acquire a good command of another language, if we have difficulty in expressing ourselves in our native tongue, and we must also agree that there is a woeful inexpertness among our immigrants in this respect. Most of these people speak the dialect of their province, which is difficult to understand in other provinces and more so in America.",
                "If every Danish immigrant would polish up on his dialect and acquire an understandable Danish, it would be a whole lot easier to conserve our language down through generations; it would also give the parents more influence over their children, when they use good Danish without an admixture of anything else; the children will not only lose respect for the \"Old Country\" language, but also for their parents, when these, largely on account of difficulties with the language, are misunderstood. From the above we arrive at the conclusion that the immigrant should learn Danish as well as the American born.",
                "The American born Danish-Americans are having difficulties in grasping the position of their parents, without knowing something about the conditions which have influenced them. This is best overcome by becoming familiar with the language as well as with its literature; unless one has the opportunity to travel and receive first-hand information, here again a command of the language plays an important role.",
                "Many will perhaps say; we can obtain the different countrie's literature in translations; this is true, but no translation from the Scandinavian or German languages into English, however good, can even approximately compare with the Original language.",
                "Others will claim there are so few opportunities to use Danish as its distribution is somewhat limited. You will find Danes wherever you go in this world and they also retain their language. We go to much trouble and many head-aches to learn the \"dead\" languages, which after our school-days are quickly forgotten.",
                "It should be the ideal of every Danish-American to know the Danish language and its characteristics. The Danish literature is so encompassing and comprehensive that no one wished to become acquainted with foreign conditions needs be without material for study. Many will say, that they are familiar with these conditions, because they have Danish parents, but here they are wrong; the Danish people and the Danish-American are two very different people both socially and in thought.",
                "The two have much to learn from one another, learning their ways of living, their horizon of life, thereby widening ones own. The same applies to the study of languages. Anyone studying a new language considers it a serious and pleasant undertaking and refrains from mixing the different languages like another \"Babylonian Confusion of Tongues.\" He will also realize that his knowledge of his own native language will materially improve as he proceeds in his study."

                "The Scandinavian Art Exhibition at the Art Institute, will be open to the public from February 28 to March 16.",
                "The exhibition consists of 150 paintings, each of the Scandinavian countries having contributed fifty. The majority are modernistic, the Danish collection being mainly from The Free Exhibition in Copenhagen. Christian Brinton and American art critics made the selections, assisted by experts from the respective countries. Director Karl Madsen and the author Otto Benron represented Denmark. The paintings have attracted a great deal of attention,and the modern expressive form of art, which is still rather unknown and little appreciated in America, has been widely discussed by Americans as well as Scandinavians. For that reason alone, the exhibition is of importance in its function as a fanfare of young, modern Nordic culture.",
                "As a forerunner for the exhibition a rather daringly designed poster has arrived, made by Gunnar Hallstrom, which portrays a viking ship plowing the ocean. A catalogue, with introductory chapters by Christian Brinton, Carl G. Laupin, Karl Madsen and Jens Thus, as well as pictures of some of the exhibiting artists and their paintings, is available.",
                "The exhibition has been arranged by the American-Scandinavian Society which obtained $5,000 from the American-Scandinavian Foundation for this purpose.",
                "The American-Scandinavian Society was founded in 1908 for the promotion of the exchange of culture with America and the Scandinavian countries and also among Scandinavians in America. For the initial capital stock, the manufacturer Niels Poulsen, of Brooklyn, donated $100,000. In addition to this, before his death in 1911, he established a fund of $500,000, known as the American-Scandinavian Foundation, a foundation intended to work in cooperation with the Scandinavian-American Society.",
                "The board of directors of the Foundation, which is self-perpetuating, consists of the following:",
                "Danish: John D. Hage, New York; Prof. Wm. Howgaard, Boston. Norwegian: John A. Gade, New York; Consul G. Haugau, Chicago. Swedish: A. E. Johnson, New York; Rev. Frederick Lynch, president; Consul-General Raon, vice-president; Wm. H. Short, treasurer; Dr. Henry Goddard Leach, secretary.",
                "The board of directors of the Scandinavian-American Society are as follows: John A. Gade, president; Rev. F. Lynch, vice-president; Dr. Henry Goddard Leach, secretary; Hans Lagerlof, treasurer. On the board of trustees are the following Danes: Eckhardt V. Eskesen, John D. Hage, Carl Lorentzen, and Frode W. Rambusch, of New York.",
                "The following are honorary vice-presidents: U. S. Minister to Denmark Egau, Copenhagen; Andrew Carnegie; Governor Eberhardt, Minnesota; Supreme Court Justice Hughes, Washington, D. C.; President Judson, University of Chicago; former president Theodore Roosevelt; Peschke Koldt, wholesaler, Copenhagen.",
                "True to its purpose, the society has been instrumental in the exchange of professors in Scandinavian and American universities. It has also done much in the granting of scholarships to Scandinavian students who wish to study at American universities, as well as to American students of Scandinavian descent who wish to study at Scandinavian universities.",
                "The society has begun publishing the American-Scandinavian Review, a periodical now issued every other month, but which in the near future is to become a monthly. The art exhibition, which will come to Chicago via New York, Buffalo, and Toledo and which is scheduled to end in Boston next month, is the latest undertaking of the society. Of course, the society is interested in getting as many members as possible in order to be able to serve its purpose. The membership dues are only $2.00 annually, and this includes a subscription to the magazine.",
                "Secretary Leach arrived in Chicago about a week ago. His mission is to represent the society in preparations for the exhibition, which will be formally opened on February 27. A group of Chicago members of the society, prominent Scandinavians and Americans, and representatives of the press have been invited to attend the opening ceremonies.",

His eyes sparkle keenly under their dark brows but reveal glimpses of joy when the conversation concerns his native country as compared with the land of rugged individualism, where he made his fortune. \"- How did you get the idea to buy Solust?\" \"- Well; it has been my desire for many years to stay in Denmark during my vacations. I used to come home every once in awhile; but now it is ten years since I was here last, and it is as though Denmark appeals to me this time more than ever so I decided to buy a place of my own. I heard Slust was for sale, and I have spent a great deal of time inspecting it and - admiring it. The deal was closed this morning, in fact it was closed last Saturday; but I had to wait for my money from Chicago, hence the delay.\" \"- Are you going to stay here permanently?\" \"- No, I still have my business in Chicago to take care of, and I cannot be away from it for more than two months during the summer.\" \"- You mean to say that you are going to maintain this elaborate mansion and use it only two months every summer? \"- It is worse than that. I am going to stay here one month only. My wife prefers to spend her vacations in Paris, so we made a deal splitting the time equally between Paris and Denmark.\" \"- Isn't this a sort of big house to use?\" \"- Maybe, and I will have to spend quite a lot of money too before I have it in first class shape; but we like to have a comfortable home, and this place suits us.\"",
                "\"- Did you buy the property without any household furnishings at all?\" \" - Yes, that is: I have made the beginning to an art collection. Cheap by the way; only 200,000 Danish crowns. However, I have in mind to attempt a restoration of Slust as it appeared in the former owner's days. Through his friends I hope to locate a great deal of the original furnishings and artistic treasures. I am sorry I did not know earlier that Slust was for sale. Had I acquired title to the property before the public auction, both the mortgage holder and I would have made a better deal.\"",

Practically all of the more than fifty Danish Societies in the city were represented, through their presidents, on the great general arrangement committee, together with a number of the oldest and most experienced veterans within the Danish colony. This set-up functioned very smoothly and efficiently. One purpose! One thought!.",
                "The driving force in the preliminary work was the enthusiastic Dr.Max Henius, who seemed tireless, and who so ably directed his associates. He was assisted by Mr. Carl Anthousen, who together with Mr. Hasselriis succeeded in inspiring the American press; never before has so much flattering attention been paid the Danes.",
                "What particularly impressed us during those stirring days, was the hearty interest with which our Swedish and Norwegian cousins participated in the festivities. We Danes have been deeply touched by the good will and brotherly sentiment thus evinced.",
                "In conclusion, we Chicago Danes wish to bring the students our heartfelt thanks for the honor they, by their beautiful and cultured song, have brought to our nation on both sides of the ocean."

No. 17 hall. He was greeted by a large and friendly audience that listened, spellbound, to his masterly interpretations of a wide selection of Aakjoers folk songs and poems. The song-lecture was a masterful presentation of a beautiful, mellow, well-trained baritone voice, of unusually wide range, combined with an artistic and dramatic ability that was refreshing. Even the simplest folk-song took on the guise of a classical composition. Songs to his own lute accompaniment were especially pleasing, moving his listeners at will to either tears or laughter. Aakjoer is popular in Denmark today because of Mikkelsen and the open hearts and ears in America bid fair to make Aakjoer Danish-America's favorite as well."

                "\"My conception of Socialism is that it stands and calls for a just distribution of daily bread acquired through collective efforts, and there is no doubt in my mind that Christian people should be first to respond to and support this demand for justice.",
                "\"However, even before an audience of Christians, who respond eagerly to an appeal for charity, it is a thankless task to talk in behalf of justice. Whenever we face an isolated case of need and misery, we feel, involuntarily, it is our duty to relieve the suffering; whereas we are sufficiently dominated by our duty to relieve the suffering; whereas we are sufficiently dominated by our egoism not to be particularly impressed when we are told of injustice and human suffering in general, that is, if we ourselves are not in need.",
                "\"But such injustice and human suffering is evident. There are untold thousands of people who have barely enough to keep body and soul together, and with no prospect of relief. However, these people are rather fortunate compared with other thousands who have not even that much and, for the sake of their pride, fight a desperate battle to keep themselves off charity.",
                "\"When it is a fact that our merciful feelings are awake, while justice is asleep, would it not be better then to seek a solution through charitable means than to press a demand for justice? Personally I do not think so, because charity is helpless in the solution of social evils. Direct aid in one case leaves a hundred others unaided who are equally deserving. The demand for social justice must be pushed before we can hope for a solution. It is not much to the credit of Christian people that they, so far, have faced our social problems with indifference. Frankly speaking, it is plain laziness. Or we simply draw the conclusion that social evils are parts and parcels of human life, imperfect as it is, and that we can do nothing about it. To think so would be to blame our God and Father for conditions we ourselves have created. We have created the conditions and it is our duty to improve them. The soulless power called High Finance, reserves the smallest possible reward for labor. It makes life a festival for the few and hell for the many. But when a man is willing and able to work, why should he beg for permission to exist? \"The laborer is worthy of his hire\" is a phrase generally accepted by Christian people.",
                "\"Now it is held that justice is asleep. Let us resolve that justice shall be awakened. It is the demand for justice that will spell progress in the future. Social progress cannot be forced. It will not occur before they, who own our natural resources, realize that they have no right to own these resources. When they relinquish their unjust property rights, social justice will come about as a consequence. Christian people have a good reason to deplore the fact that they were not the ones who raised the demand for social justice. Those of us who have joined in that demand should be ready to disprove the claim that we associate with atheists. We have been indifferent and maintained a reserved attitude entirely too long. Now we come praying for a permit to join the ranks of those, who are veterans in the fight and often times come out as victors--without us.\""

                "Teachers in Denmark inquired whether they would be given an opportunity to earn the money necessary for a trip to America, by working temporarily among the Scandinavians over here. The idea may seem appealing; it is, nevertheless, hardly practical for one thing, the Scandinavians of America keep themselves segregated along national lines. Each national group maintains its own schools, often in conjunction with the churches, and as a rule, have very limited funds. There are, moreover, plenty of teachers available at anytime the private schools are able to provide the funds with which to pay their salaries. Scandinavian grammar schools in this country will never be anything but an appendix to the American school system. So far as the adults are concerned, they have, at least in the cities, excellent opportunities to learn the English language and add to their knowledge by attending evening courses offered by the Public Schools, they seem to favor this method of learning.",
                "No doubt a trip to America would be beneficial to many schoolmasters of the old country; but why not let the Danish Government make an annual appropriation for the purpose of financing these trips to America for a few teachers each year? In the final analysis, it is the state that will benefit by such educational travels. Students of industry and trade receive scholarships for such journeys every year, not to speak of writers, artists and scientists. Why are not the teachers, whose works of educating the young generation is just as important, given the same privileges? A state, that can afford to spend 25,000,000 Kroner for military purposes every year, should be able to spare a few thousand Kroner for such educational purposes as the training of its teachers. Or is the military extravagance perhaps the reason for strict economy when cultural values are at stake? If it is, the teachers of Denmark are not without means with which to change the situation, which is a deplorable one, to say the least."

Starvation wages and discontent are not responsible for people going Socialistic. Neither are high wages with consequent arrogance and a liking to kick with the hind-legs the causes, nor something in between these extremes. The cause of Socialism is a realization of the fact that the prevailing conception of a profit system which is able to function only at the cost of wage slaves is inhumane brutal and unworthy of a civilized people. The sponsors of the Socialistic movement are to be credited with the progress it makes in this country. Even the Socialist hater Roosevelt must have a feeling that the Socialistic movement carrying with it a better general understanding of social problems is not entirely objectionable because in the course of the conversation he expressed his desire to have the whole country of Denmark moved to America."

At the table Admiral Richelieu occupied the place of honor, with Consul Hansen on his left and Dr. Max Menius on his right side. The consul made a brief introductory speech and appointed Dr. Max Henius as master of ceremonies. Dr. Henius spoke in behalf of the Admiral and the great business enterprise of which he is the head.",
                "The Admiral expressed his thanks on behalf of himself and his associates. He appreciated the hospitality with which fellow Danes received them. He made an excellent speech which naturally concerned the question of immigration, and particularly Danish immigrants in America and their relations with the homeland. The Admiral's speech was particularly interesting, as it was founded on his own personal experiences, gained through years of activity under foreign flags. He mentioned how in earlier days people at home were mercilessly considering the emigrants as lost for the mother-country, and many looked at them as undesirable altogether. Fortunately this attitude has changed and given way to a deeper understanding of the important role played by emigrants in Denmark's relationship with foreign countries. A great share of Denmark's foreign trade has been built up by Danes who have settled in other countries; and it is a fact that huge sums of money are pouring into Denmark every year as the result of the labor of ambitious and hard working Danish emigrants. Therefore the public attitude in Denmark is not either indifferent or hostile towards the emigrants any longer. People are seriously concerned about the establishment of mutual understandings with foreign countries. The speaker wished the emigrants from Denmark all kinds of success and happiness, and continued: \"But when emigrants grow old the memory of the old country comes again to the fore, and in many instances they conclude that 'there is no place like home.' Lucky are those who are able to arrange for a return, to enjoy the fruits of their labor, and benefit by the experiences they gained abroad!\"",

Playwright Zangenberg sang \"Hjemmets Sang\" (Song of the Homeland), by Holger Drachmann, and spoke in behalf of the Danish-American Association and of Chevalier Hertz, especially. Mr. Hertz spoke for America and pointed to the fact that America is a country where emigrants go to and stay, yet without forgetting their origin and mother country. Editor Ivar Kirkegaard also made a speech. A song written by the indefatigable Carl Hansen was sung and Mr. Zangenberg gave another solo.",
                "After the banquet Senator Niels Juhl made one of his famous genuine humoristic speeches. Later a speech for the Danish language was made by Dr. Niels Johnson who pointed to the significance of having such celebrities as Mrs. Oda Nielsen and Mr. Zangenberg visit us.",
                "Among those participating was old Mr. A. A. Westengaard whose son, the young Professor Jens J. Westengaard, a graduate from Harvard University, has held an outstanding position as counsel to the King of Siam for many years.",
                "Of others participating we mention Mr. Lundberg, the Swedish manager of A. E. Johnson and Co's F.D.S. office in Chicago. There were also American newspapermen who, considering the affair was a purely Danish one, furnished a reasonably good report on the event. Only the Chronicle made the mistake of making Consul Hansen the author of the song that was sung as an alternative for the many speeches, something Consul Hansen could not have done at all.",
                "After a visit to A. E. Johnson's office the honored guests left for Baltimore and from there they continued to Washington, D. C., where they had an appointment with the President. Last Tuesday they returned to New York and in the evening attended a banquet arranged by Danes at a price of ten dollars per plate.",
                "Admiral Richelieu is small of size, but he is one of Denmark's real great men. His life history sounds like a fairy tale. He was born in Schleswig Holstein where his father was a minister. After military service as lieutenant of the Navy Richelieu entered the Siamese Marine Corps and was successively promoted to captain, commander, admiral and trusted advisor to King Chulalongkorn during his reorganization of the Siamese Marine Corps. In 1899 he was appointed Minister of the Navy and remained in that office until 1902 at which time he returned to Denmark, partly on account of his wife's health and partly because he longed for the old country. During the twenty-eight years he stayed in Siam he assisted a number of Danes in obtaining excellent positions, and contributed heavily to promote Danish trade relations over there and in other places in the East. In 1905 he was appointed president of the Danish United Shipowner's Society, in which position his outstanding talents as an organizer and administrator soon were felt from the very center to the outermost branches of this world-wide organization. Admiral Richelieu has led the company into and through one of its most glamorous periods and at the same time managed to make himself almost as popular as his predecessor, \"Russian\" Braadt, was unpopular because he was feared and hated by the personnel and workers. Only recently, before his trip to America, the Admiral donated an entire year's salary and bonus, about 65,000 Kroner, as a basis for a fund, the proceeds of which are to be used to aid employees of the Company."

                "Presuming that Mr. Taugenberg intends to carry his royal greetings and cheers with him farther into the country, we hereby take the liberty modestly to recommend that he put his ear to the ground and proceed with caution. Not all Danes in America have so much fondness for royal frankincense as our snobbish colleagues in the East pretend to have Mr. Taugenberg is going to encounter various opinions as to the necessity and the advisability of a country of Denmark's size having royal institutions, and he is going to meet Danes who are so loyal to this Republic that they resent any sort of propaganda pointing in the opposite direction.",

What we want to point out is that our intellectual standard is above that kind of silliness."

                "In a letter to the Record-Herald, dated Copenhagen, June 27, William E. Curtis says in part:",
                "\"There does not seem to be any public interest in Denmark on the subject of selling the Island of St. Thomas to the United States. The radical and liberal parties favor the sale. The conservative party, which is a very small minority, is opposed, but has the support of the king and the ministry, which has thus far been successful in preventing the adoption of positive instructions for the sale. The king has said that he wishes to hand down to his successor on the throne the same territory he has governed through his life, and that, while Denmark may not need a base of supplies in the American hemisphere at present, no one can tell when such an advantage might be valuable. Therefore, as long as he lives it is not probable that the sale will be accomplished,and the crown prince is usually of the same opinion as his father. It is believed that when Frederick ascends the throne he will continue the same policy that Christian has pursued.",
                "\"There is not the slightest possibility of the sale of St. Thomas to Germany, as Mr. Lodge and some of our other politicians in the United States have suggested. Denmark will sell nothing to Germany. The Danes hate the Germans as bitterly as they are hated by the French, and for similar reasons.",
                "\"The proposition to sell the Danish West Indies to the United States is a commercial speculation originating with and promoted by a syndicate of businessmen and politicians who expect to realize a large commission for their services. Their plan is to secure the passage of an act by the Danish parliament authorizing the sale at a stated price, which is to be kept secret, and then negotiate with the United States on a basis that will give them a profit of $1,000,000 or more. The scheme is well understood by President McKinley and Secretary Hay, who have repeatedly declined to negotiate with agents sent to Washington by the syndicate. At least two have appeared there, and both were told that the United States Government could not consider any proposition that did not come through the regular diplomatic channels, and no such proposition has ever been received from that source.",
                "\"Nor has the subject ever been discussed officially with authorized representatives of the Danish Government at Washington. So far as I can learn, the United States minister at Copenhagen has encouraged the syndicate to persevere in its efforts, and a general impression prevails that he has held out hopes of success. He is personally intimate with members of the syndicate, and if he is not careful he will find himself involved in a scandal which is sure to follow a successful conclusion of their scheme. Members of parliament and influential politicians outside, newspaper editors, bankers and speculators, number unknown, are all expecting a large rake-off when St. Thomas is sold, and it is rumored that considerable money has been and will be used to influence the proper persons. A gentleman who is well posted concerning the intrigues, declared today that Denmark was threatened with something like the Panama Canal scandal in France.\"",
                "As will be seen, Mr. Curtis has reserved himself completely upon this question. When, during the first McKinley administration, rumors about a contemplated sale of the Danish West Indies began to fill the press, Mr. Curtis was one of the very first among prominent Washington correspondents to give them currency. He introduced to his readers a certain faker whom he represented as a secret agent of the Danish Government, explaining with much circumstantiality why the Copenhagen Government had found it necessary to adopt such irregular methods of conducting negotiations through the Danish minister at Washington.",
                "Among the Danes here in Chicago these disclosures were regarded with a great deal of amusement. They knew the \"secret agent\" as an expert bluffer of unlimited cheek, but were somewhat surprised to see him trap, with such apparent ease, an old and trained hand like Mr. Curtis. As explained by the Skandinaven at the time, there was absolutely no foundation for the rumors about an impeding sale, the idea of which was obnoxious not only to the old king and the cabinet, but also to the people of Denmark. The rumors originated with a gang of would-be speculators in Denmark and the United States, who endeavored to deceive and influence public opinion and governmental action in both countries by means of a flood of manufactured or bogus cable dispatches.",
                "It is fortunate that Mr. Curtis has learned the truth at last. But it is unfortunate that he should fall into fresh errors. It is not true that \"the liberal and radical parties\" in Denmark favor the sale. Nearly all of the liberal leaders have in the most emphatic terms expressed their opposition to any sale, and they are backed by their followers. The businessmen of Denmark are practically a unit in opposition. Nor is it true that Denmark would not transfer the Islands to Germany. On the contrary, the possibility of trading the Danish West Indies for the northern strip of Schleswig, which is still held by Prussia in violation of Article V of the treaty of Prague, is in Denmark looked upon as one of the very strongest reasons why the Islands should not be sold to the United States or any other power.",
                "What Mr. Curtis has to say about the power and influence of the St. Thomas syndicate is undoubtedly a gross exaggeration. There has been nothing in the discussion of the matter by the Danish press to warrant such sweeping assertions. The active members of the syndicate are people who are not Danes in blood, but men with shady reputations if they have any at all. They have the support of one boulevard newspaper, which makes a business to ridicule everything and patriotism in particular. But their corruption fund is so limited,and the rogues among public men in Denmark are so scarce that the suggestion of a huge scandal, \"something like the Panama Canal scandal in France,\" is utterly unwarranted and absurd.",
                "Mr. Curtis has placed the United States minister at Copenhagen in a rather compromising position. He is, we are informed, personally intimate with members of the syndicate, has encouraged it to persevere in its efforts, and if he is not careful he is likely to find himself involved in the scandal. This is equivalent to saying that Mr. Swenson is a member of the syndicate or has received a share of its alleged corruption fund. No responsible newspaperman would prefer such a serious charge against a representative of the government unless he felt absolutely convinced of its truth. Yet, the Skandinaven is unwilling to believe, until better evidence is produced, that Mr. Swenson has done anything to justify such accusations. In view of his early associations, his training, and strong religious convictions, it is all but impossible to believe that he should have sustained personally intimate relations with members of a corrupt clique; and considering his tact, discretion, and knowledge of the machinery of our government, it is equally unlikely that he should have \"held out hopes of success\" to the scheming coterie. It is probable that some irresponsible gossipmonger or some enemy of Mr. Swenson has poured this tale into the ears of Mr. Curtis and thus made him an unconscious talebearer of vicious slander. While it is true that the general superficiality and unreliability of his letters from Copenhagen detract from the gravity of the charge, Mr. Swenson will probably call upon Mr. Curtis for a full and complete retraction."

The papers had been against her coming, but she was very well received and much liked by the colony. She had with her a prologue written by the great Danish poet, Holger Drachmann. She was a splendid storyteller, and she told many stories. She was first invited by the Young People's society on the West Side. Dania arranged a meeting for her, and she paid a visit to Harmonien. The Danish Central Committee met and decided to invite her to a great meeting sometime in August when she returns from her trip to the Pacific coast."

                "The activities that Doctor Henius pursued as a citizen, that is, in the service of the community and his fellow citizens, were undoubtedly very near to his heart. It is safe to say that they came next to his interests in his professional duties, and it may well be, that on occasion, his unrewarded public services were allowed to supersede his private commitments and that sometimes the latter suffered in consequence.",
                "It was in his capacity as representative citizen, now more than twenty-five years ago, when he was acting as the official host to a group of Danish singing societies on tour in this country, that I first met him. In the course of the Danish society's visit to Chicago they came to the Public Library with Doctor Henius as their guide, and it fell to my lot to receive them and show them something of the institution. I believe I am quite safe in saying that Doctor Henius's keen interest in the Library and its work dates from that visit.",
                "In 1911, he was appointed by the Mayor as a member of the Board of Directors--not we may be sure at his own request or through any effort on his part--for one thing that he would never do, was to ask anything for himself, but simply because he was the representative of a national group.",
                "It did not take him long, not only to become an active member of the Board in full sympathy with the policies and spirit of service of an American Public Library, but also to achieve recognition as a leader in the Board, and incidentally, and enthusiastic protagonist and booster of the American Public Library.",
                "On his annual trip to Denmark in 1913, two years after his appointment, he took with him a set of slides illustrating the work of the Library, and delivered a lecture before the city officials of Copenhagen.",
                "In the spring of 1914, when his first term of office expired, his fellow members took an official action unique in the history of the Library before or since, expressing by vote their hope that he would be reappointed, and undertook individually to urge his reappointment by personal representation to the Mayor.",
                "Happily their hopes and wishes were fulfilled and Doctor Henius was duly returned for a second term from July, 1914, to July, 1917, and served two years as its president.",
                "It was then that the full force of his energy and enthusiasm became manifest. He dreamed of a Library service for Chicago so complete as to be within reach of every citizen, and to realize his dream, he announced a plan--still valid and in progress, and still incomplete--of dividing the city into five regional districts with a regional branch in each.",
                "But then came the entry of this country into the War, and everything else was submerged in the national emergency. That year Doctor Henius returned from abroad full of the provisions the belligerent countries were making for the welfare of their armies in the trenches. They were among other things, providing a book service for the soldiers, and that appealed to him as a wise and important enterprise.",
                "As soon as he reached Chicago, he proceeded to organize a similar service here with the Chicago Public Library as its center and headquarters. Appeals for gifts of books were issued to the public, and soon the books' began to pour in. In Chicago alone we collected four hundred thousand volumes. I shall never forget the first truckloads sent out to Fort Sheridan and Great Lakes one Saturday afternoon with Doctor Henius and some of the rest of us following in a motor car. Thus there began the campaign for \"Books for Soldiers,\" which spread all over the country, and sponsored by the American Library Association.",
                "resulting in the despatch of books by the millions to American soldiers and sailors in training camps, in the trenches, and on the high seas.",
                "In 1917 it came to pass that by a turn of the political wheel, Doctor Kenius and all his colleagues on the Board were suddenly superseded by new appointees, and for the next eight years, our contacts with him were informal and unofficial, but we continued without interruption on the basis of his friendship for us and the Library, and his keen and permanent interest in its work. In 1925 he again joined the Board, and remained a member for five years. Gradually, under the stress of those difficult years and his increasing desire to spend more time abroad, we noted a decline in his fervor, and a growing preoccupation with other affairs that required his personal attention. In 1930 he resigned from the Library Board, one year before the expiration of his term, and against the protests of his fellow members. After that we saw little of him, and could only cherish the memories of the happy and fruitful years that had passed.",
                "This was the only continuous public service that he was called upon to render to his fellow citizens in this city. One may legitimately speculate as to why a man of so much force, enthusiasm, and ability was not called upon more often, and to more important public service. In Denmark, his activities received national recognition. Here in Chicago they were confined to the limited interests of a single community, and a single institution. It was not alone that he never asked nor put himself forward. Neither did he do that in Denmark, and yet he became a national figure. Nor is it merely because the kingdom of Denmark numbers about the same in population as the city of Chicago. It is a difference in attitude toward public service, and the evaluation of life.",
                "I remember once, when he sat for an unreasonable time in the ante-room of the Mayor of Chicago, waiting in vain to be received. He said, simply and a little bewildered, \"I can see the King of Denmark in less time than that.\" And so he could. The King of Denmark knew him as a citizen of his country, and valued the contributions he made to his country's welfare.",
                "When the Public Library took official notice of his death, it did not employ words of mourning or condolence.",
                "Those who had been associated with him, remember him with admiration for his enthusiasm, energy, and achievements, and cherish the memory of a joyous and lighthearted companion and friend, a leader of his fellowmen.",
                "And so the Board of Directors spread upon its records a Memorial Minute in testimony of its gratitude for the career of a great and useful citizen, and a loyal and devoted friend of the Chicago Public Library.",
                "It is as such that we honor his memory, as a great and useful citizen and a loyal and devoted friend."

                "When people immigrate to a foreign country and immediately are confronted with the task of adapting themselves to unfamiliar conditions and acquiring a new language, they feel the need of fellowship and mutual understanding, because people are like trees, they cannot be transplanted from one soil to another without some disturbance of the inner life taking place.",
                "It is equally true that irrespective of how willing men are to be transformed into Americans, they can only by a slow process change their habits and view points, and while that growth takes place, their hearts are divided between love for the country of their birth, and interest in, and loyalty to, their adopted country.",
                "During that difficult and precarious period of development, a bewildered groping people seek out men who can be their leaders and guides; men who are like sheltering rocks in the storm or shade-giving trees in a thirsty land.",
                "Dr. Max Henius was just such a natural leader, endowed with foresight, imagination, and intellectual strength.",

                "When the discussion is of men who till their last day have retained an undying love for Denmark, the name of Dr. Henius must be singled out. He spared neither time nor effort to foster and secure the things which were dear to his Danish ancestors and which he felt should survive in the hearts and in the minds of men regardless of the distance and years which separated them from the homeland.",
                "He labored for this principle with such fervor that his enthusiasm was a challenge to other men who perhaps had lost interest, and it moved them to follow his example.",
                "At times he became a solitary dreamer, climbing to heights where we could not follow him, but he always revealed what he saw from his high tower. It can truthfully be said that his visions were not inane reveries or idle dreams. Many of them became realities which brought honor and enjoyment to the Danish colony, glory to himself, and stamped him as a truly outstanding progressive personality.",
                "It was mainly through his initiative that the Danish-American Society succeeded in bringing to this country such celebrated Danes as former Prime-Minister Borbjerg, and the late world-renowned literary critic, Professor George Brandes, as well as the student choir of the University of Copenhagen. He likewise gave not only moral support, but also material aid to various excursions made by several Danish societies to Denmark.",
                "These achievements gave the impetus to a movement resulting in an exchange of scholars between America and Denmark, and strengthened their friendly relationship.",
                "It is satisfying to add that not only was Dr. Max Henius great as the instigator of such momentous events as those just mentioned, or when addressing a large audience presenting and explaining one of his magnificent ideas, but he was equally true and great when engaged in a friendly chat with a fellow Dane reviving dear memories of bygone days in the little charming country of the North.",
                "It is perhaps significant that Dr. Henius died at a time when immigration has practically stopped and the sons and daughters of the immigrants are coming to the front.",
                "They are native Americans to be sure, yet in their souls are left family traits, which although deeply rooted in the old world, now through them have become part of American traditions.",
                "Every nationality has its own noble and beautiful characteristics, and whatever the Danes may have contributed to life in this country in the way of material success, intellectual progress, and spiritual advancement can, at least to a great extent, be credited to the influence of that man, to whom we at this moment are paying our highest tribute.",
                "It should therefore be gratifying to us in America to know that that part of his life-work which dealt with Danes and Danish activities, his exhortations not to forget Denmark, its history, art, stories and songs, in the last instance crystalizes in American life.",
                "So while we mourn the loss of our leader, a man beloved by his friends and respected by his critics, our grief is tempered with the joyful realization that he was not removed from our midst before he had performed his duties, accomplished his task, and left his lofty ideals glowing in the heart of every Dane.",
                "His life was an inspiration, and if we could learn to live our lives as he lived his, we should be better men.",

He then began a campaign of communication by telephone, correspondence, travel, etc., stretching over weeks, months, or even years, until he had fulfilled his dream in life. Then after a few weeks of seeming relaxation and peace, he would suddenly flare up again with a new ideal, and the whole works started again! He reminded me of the prophet, Jeremiah, who, threatened and prosecuted, once said: \"Often I have been tired of it, and often I have said: I will no longer speak in the name of the Lord, but it has become as a burning fire in my bones. I cannot keep quiet!\" There was such an inner ethical fire burning in the soul of Max Henius, and his scientific and business genius was permeated by it. I said at the banquet celebrating his seventy-fifth anniversary: \"Max Henius is a practical idealist. In modern religious language: Max Henius was a great saint.\""

                "Mr. Nielsen has been an undertaker on Fullerton Avenue and Spaulding Street for 22 years. Only five years ago he erected a beautiful apartment building and undertaking establishment on the corner of Spaulding and Fullerton Avenue which made his funeral home one of, if not the largest and most modern in the country.",
                "Many flowers, beautifully arranged, were part of the evidence of friendship displayed by many people. Thousands of friends kept calling and extending sympathy. Some could and did say it with flowers, many by telegrams and mail; but most of his friends were of a type he had at some time or other befriended in time of great need. Many were the favors Christ Nielsen had extended to some very poor families, and that without boasting. As far as Fullerton Avenue is concerned, every business man will admit that he has always been ready to help either financially or in spirit for the good of the community. The writer has often seen Nielsen reach in his vest pocket to hand alms to a poor beggar, which he kept for this special purpose.",
                "Mr. Christ Nielsen was born in Westerweig, Denmark, 71 years ago, on August 20, 1863, and immigrated to this country at the age of 15 years. At 29 he was united in marriage to Marie Bredal on October 22, 1892. They were blessed with four children and six grand children. The grand-children were: Robert and Homer G. Nielsen, Marilynn Jean Andersen, Cora Jane Nielsen, Delores Marie and Roberta Sue Olson, who were responsible for many happy hours in the lives of their grandparents.",
                "Many thousands of friends and relatives paid their last respects to Christ Nielsen as the body lay in state. Well over a thousand friends were present at the funeral rites in the Home. Amplifiers were used to send the voices of those officiating into the many rooms which were crowded to capacity. Mr. George Dupont Hansen, for 40 years church organist played the organ. The Danish Lutheran Trinity Masonic Quartette rendered such hymns as \"Lead Kindly Light,\" \"The Old Rugged Cross\" and several others in most beautiful harmony. Rev. A. W. Andersen of the Danish Lutheran Trinity Church consoled all present with verses from the Testament and touched on the life of the deceased. He was followed by Rev. Lewis Moe of the First Lutheran Church, who told of the departed's favorite chapter, John 14. He also conveyed a message from the Fullerton Avenue Business Men to the family and the assemblage. Rev. Moe was followed by the Masons, who officiated. The many flowers sent by business and professional men (many of the undertaking profession), as well as relatives and friends, were carried out to eight cars necessary to transfer them to the cemetery.",
                "Mr. Christ Nielsen leaves behind a very devoted wife, four children, grand children, relatives and many friends, who all agree that not only they, or Logan Square, but also the world is better for his having lived. Long live his pleasant memory."

Incidentally, I was one of them. Partly because it was such a large library containing over one million books (now containing about three million), it offered a trememdous opportunity of seeing books gathered from all parts of the world and also of learning methods of library work. Practically all the people who were engaged in this work went out into the world soon after and took charge of other libraries.",
                "\"Do you see those two pictures on the wall?\" asked Mr. Bay.",
                "\"No,\" I answered, rather bewildered, for a quick scrutiny revealed neat gray drapes adorning three immense windows; two huge bookcases filled with magnificent books, and about nineteen pictures hanging on the wall. Still, my impression was not of overcrowdedness, but on the contrary, everything was arranged with good taste.",

                "\"No--oh, no! When I was young, I wanted to be a traveler and to explore, especially, the tropics. That was partly because my family had traveled so much. My father was an old \"Forty-niner\" in the gold rush. He took a steamer to Baltimore and went down to Cape Horn, South America, and then up to California. So you see I have an innate lust for traveling and exploring.",
                "\"In 1925, I went to my native Denmark. When I traversed the same fields, climbed the same steps, and reached for the doorhandle of my home, I remembered my childhood days and the times when I could not reach high enough to grasp that handle. A flood of memories overwhelmed me and I was lost in the chaos of loneliness, which fostered a feeling of ennui. Three months later, when I perceived the Statue of Liberty, and the skyscrapers dotting the coast of New York, an exotic thrill ran through my veins; the greatest thrill ran through my veins, the greatest thrill I have ever had! For this was home!\"",
                "An interval of silence followed as Mr. Bay drew aside the drapes to allow a stream of light, issuing forth, to brighten the room. A beam of sunlight lit upon a gold letter opener, flickered, and, disappeared. We gazed out of the window and saw the steady flow of automobiles wending their way through an endless maze of traffic.",
                "\"Shall I tell you how I came to write a story?\" asked Mr. Bay, wistfully and dreamily. He continued,\" Of all the places I have visited there are none I like so well as I do Kentucky --partly because it is rich with legends, stories of the past, pioneer life, and old relics. It was while I was visiting Kentucky that I came to an old Trappist Monastery so named because the men living there never talk. When I entered the place I felt a cloak of the middle ages shroud me and completly envelop me in darkness, silence, and gloom. A few miles away was civilization, but here was utter wilderness, a replica of the past ages. I was ushered into the presence of an Abbot who was a dear friend of mine. Here the first inkling of an idea for a story was born. On a desk before us stood a magnificent golden chalice. Four gems: a diamond, a sapphire, a topaz, and a ruby were inserted in the base. The ruby was chipped! How had it became shipped? The Abbot declared that the chip was probably caused by some careless fellow in a factory where the stones had been set or when it was polished. The next morning, as I was sitting in my anteroom, Mr. Young E. Allisen, author of that famous poem \"Fifteen Men on a Dead Man's Chest,\" entered. As he was rather deaf, I wrote on a sheet of paper, \"The Chalice of the Chipped Ruby,\" and immediately retired. We met in the sunny gardens a little later and he said \"The Chalice of the Chipped Ruby would make a dandy title for a book.\" After a heated debate between us, it was finally decided that I should write the story. I wrote it--a book of fancies! Here is a copy. Read it some time and tell me what you think of it.\"",
                "I read the book. Herewith follows a short paragraph taken from it--a paragraph in which the Abbot is telling what he has learned from the Chipped Ruby concerning the Monastery and people:",
                "\"We may discover any minute some weak spot in our armor of supposed firmness. Now you know the main cause of our silence and seclusion: We live by faith, but our very faith impels us to fear being chipped, as you said, in contact with the world. We may differ on many points, but none of us care to be found with a flaw. Even you men of the world do not wish to expose yourselves. When you are caught unaware, a waste of time is at least involved. To avoid exposure --is one lesson of this Chalice of the Chipped Ruby!\""

                "The first president of the first Danish National Committee, (which then had the pompous title: \"The Joint Committee Of The Danish Societies For The Arrangement Of The National Festival In Chicago 1909), was Claus Jensen, born in Flade, Mors, Denmark, November 29, 1867. Having served his king and country, Claus Jensen emigrated to U.S.A. and was naturalized as a citizen 1905. Representing the Danish Brotherhood in America, Lodge No. 35 as a delegate to the First Danish National Committee, he, in the year 1920, returned to this representation of Danish Societies in Chicago and vicinity as a delegate from Danish Brotherhood, Lodge No. 298.",
                "It is recorded in the annals of the Danish National Committee, that no more faithful worker for the ideals and ideals, promulgated by said committee, has been found, than Claus Jensen.",
                "His enthusiasm and convincing logic had the effect and inspiration required to win over the most hesitating and, quite often, intolerant delegates, who could not or would not see the light, but who under his leadership became eager to work, with vigor and vim, for whatever cause Claus Jensen, or \"Little Claus\", as he popularly was named, thought worthy of support.",
                "His popularity and renown as an indefatigable and honest worker, during eight years as Supreme Trustee carried him, in the year 1927, into office as Supreme Vice-President of the Danish Brotherhood in America, an office he held to his death. When this organization celebrated its 50th anniversary (1931), he was eulogized, in the Jubilee-Book published for this event, as one of the foremost leaders and most tireless workers for the Danish Brotherhood in America.",
                "When the Danish Brotherhood in America in 1925 arranged a Joint-Tour to Denmark for its members, Claus Jensen fared forth on a visit to his \"old country\". He was knighted by the king for merit, and it was truly said among his friends and associates, that never had a more honorable knight, \"without fear and without reproach\", been created.",
                "His never failing love for the art and culture of his native land was given its best expression, when he, in the year 1928, in the month of April, on the 20th anniversary of the Danish Committees, brought the staging in Chicago, Illinois of the famous Danish historical play \"Elverhoj\" to a triumphal culmination, under the auspices of the 20th Danish National Committee. The remembrance of this literary and histrionic event still lives among his countrymen and women.",
                "On the 16th day of June, 1928, Claus Jensen was stricken suddenly and was brought to the Norwegian-American Hospital for an operation. The operation for gall stone being a success, he was brought back to his home,4429 Leland Avenue, Chicago, Illinois. Here he died after a sudden collapse on the 11th day of July 1928.",
                "The Danish Brotherhood in America, by popular subscription, caused a monument to be set upon his grave in Memorial Cemetery, Evanston, Illinois, which was unveiled on the 26th day of May, 1929. In the same year his many friends and family associates in Chicago raised his bauta at his birth-place in Denmark.",
                "In the year 1885 Claus Jensen married Mrs. Sophie Rasussen, for whose children: Marie (Mrs. Chr. Worm), Anna (Mrs. Peter Jensen), Hattie (Mrs. Niels Jensen), Petrea (Mrs. A. Freeding), Julie (Mrs. J. Egholm), and Johanne (Mrs. C. Carlson) he became a kind and loving father, whose memory is revered and loved by all and sundry.",
                "The characteristics of Claus Jensen were his honesty of purpose, his ability to make even the most recalcitrant worker see the cause in preferment to the individual, his unselfishness and his unswerving, all-absorbing, friendliness toward his fellow-men. He, whom Claus Jensen called a friend, could not suffer from the feeling of loneliness or desertion--for \"Little Claus\" had the divine gift to inspire the true feeling of brotherhood--and he never deserted his friends.",
                "In this year of our Lord, Nineteen Hundred and Thirty-three, five years after his death, the name of Claus Jensen, and the remembrance of his all-friendly attitude towards everyone he esteemed and liked, is still kept alive, and the memory of his friendship holds a charm, that carries many a man safely over these days of depression and cynicism, when former ideals and ideas seem to be sunk in the darkness of materialism and selfishness.",
                "And the remembrance of Claus Jensen and his faith in idealistic endeavor shall not die, as long as Danish ideals are honored in this, his and our, adopted land."

He bought the building in which his drugstore was located and remained there until 1925 when he sold out, with the intention of going out of business, to rest and enjoy life, after his many years of continuous service in his profession.",

                "He graduated from public and high schools in Chicago, Ill., and completed a four-year course in mechanical engineering. He married Agnes Hilegard Stark of Evanston, Ill., Aug 14, 1906. His children are, Virginia (Mrs. George Hoffman), William Stark, Betty Jane (Mrs. E. J. Driscoll), and Jack Augie. At the age of eight he came to America, and despite the handicap of not knowing the English language, Mr. Hansen overcame this obstacle quite readily and developed rapidly in his studies.",
                "He began his business career as a tool and die apprentice with the Western Electric Company 1893. He was with E. W. Bliss, Brooklyn, N. Y. and Greise Manufacturing Co., New Haven, Conn., from 1897 to 1905, and with the Acorn Brass Manufacturing Co., Chicago, as works manager from 1905 to 1909.",
                "In 1909 Mr. Hansen organized the Justrite Manufacturing Co., Chicago, Ill., of which he was vice president and general manager. He sold out his interest in the Justrite Manufacturing Co., in 1920 and organized the A. L. Hansen Manufacturing Co., 5037 Ravenswood Ave., Chicago, of which he is president, general manager and director.",
                "He is exceptionally versatile and original in his ideas as an inventor, having upwards of 250 patents to his credit. These inventions are used not only throughout the United States but in many foreign countries. Among them are the carbide miners' lamp, automatic liquid measuring machine, tetrachloride fire extinguisher, fireproof chemical container, letter-folding machine, tatting shuttle, hook rug needle, foot pedal refuse container, revolving gum display stand, and numerous other inventions. He has acted as counsellor in the development of inventions for concerns and individuals, but with his varied activities his services in this respect are available only in rare instances. In addition to the wide range of patented products mentioned, Mr. Hansen is also the inventor of a complete line of motor body hardware, including door locks, window regulators, corner braces, etc., and more recently has developed a variety of refrigerator body hardware, the first of its kind to be produced. During the World war he engaged in designing gas masks and in allied activities.",

His home is 2129 Central Park Ave., Evanston, Ill., His business address is 5037 Ravenswood Ave., Chicago, Ill.",
                "One of Mr. Hansen's long cherished hopes, namely to revisit his native land, was fulfilled in June, 1932, when he returned to his homeland, visiting his birthplace in Viborg and other points of special interest and significance to him.",
                "Combining in an almost equal degree both executive and inventive ability, Mr. Hansen is one of the few exceptions in this respect. He is not an idle dreamer, but a practical, far-sighted business-man, who has made a success not only as an inventor, but in the manufacture and marketing of his products, all of which we originated in his prolific brain. Besides being intensely practical and highly creative, Mr. Hansen is at the same time a man who possesses the confidence and friendship of his acquaintances, friends, business associates and employees. The mention of his name, either as an individual or a trade-mark upon his products, is a symbol of integrity, solidity and dependability."

And--here among you is one of the thirty who was selected.",

It was just thirty years ago that he first sighted the gleaming Statue of Liberty as he neared the land which was to mean so much to him and his family, yet to come.",
                "Sorensen had served an apprenticeship under the splendid training schools of Denmark in the creamery business. He was well equipped to enter this field of effort, as Denmark is one of the most prominent of all the nations of the earth in the dairy and creamery business.. But Sorensen was not in a hurry to start. He was waiting for the opportunity that he knew would come. He spent a brief period getting acquainted with the language and customs of the American people, and then embarked in his first business venture, with the enthusiastic help of his young and attractive wife, Ane Kirstine.",
                "The start was a small one, and the discouragements were many. The large powerful dairy concerns of Chicago thought that he would not go far. His single milk route which he operated himself, seemed so small and ineffective compared to the many, many routes that the large dairies were running. But Sorensen persisted. He worked hard--his wife worked hard, and soon their little business began to grow. They were crowded for room at the little place at 1249 North Western Avenue, and larger quarters were necessary to house the growing business.",
                "Just four years after the first start, Sorensen moved his dairy business to the modern plant he had built for it at its present address at 1521-1525 North Ridgway Avenue, Chicago, Ill. This was in 1912. His plant, as good as any in the city, although not so large, was then named the Union Grove Creamery, and the dairy products produced for their high quality under the able supervision of Mr. Sorensen, soon became known to the rapidly growing population of the Great west Side of Chicago. He has ever kept pace with progress. As soon as new and better machinery for processing his milk and other dairy products, was developed, Sorensen immediately investigated it. He has always followed this policy and today, his plant is modern, scrupulously clean, and up to the minute in efficiency.",
                "Milk, sweet, cool, and refreshing, and all the products that come from milk, the sweet rich cream, the golden butter, the flaky creamed cottage cheese, buttermilk--either cultured or homechurned, are distributed by the trucks and wagons of the Union Grove Creamery Co. The man who was selected, one out of a thousand, from the King's Navy, has brought the same efficiency to his dairy.",
                "Sorensen has not confined himself altogether to his business. He realizes the necessity of a man doing good things where they can be done. So,he has helped in the Lion's Club, he early became a member of the Danish Old People's Home Society. Dania, the popular social club of the Danes of Chicago has had his name on its roster for years, he is a member of the Medinah Temple, and all that it means in preparation and character, and because of his ability and effective personality, he has been chosen as an active member of the Danish National Committee, and of the Danish group of the World's Fair Committee.",
                "But these are all clubs and societies of a personal nature. They had nothing to do with his business. So Sorensen thought that was a phase of his life that should not be neglected. He belongs to the Milk Council of Greater Chicago, and to the Chicago Milk Dealers Association.",
                "The Dairymen's Country Club, with a beautiful recreation estate in the north woods of Wisconsin elected him to active membership, and the Century Dairy Club, of the Century of Progress of Chicago carries his name on its roster of membership.",
                "Mr. Sorensen's son, Thorwald, has been associated with his father in the business for several years. He is married, and four years ago, his charming wife made it possible to call the subject of our story--grandfather. The granddaughter, Jane Marie Sorensen, appears on the back page of this magazine. Her pretty appearance and rosy complexion, her mother, Gertrude Sorensen says, are the direct result of drinking milk each and every day. Thorwald is a young man in his late twenties who promises to show the startling qualities and attractive personality of his father. Thorwald's sister, Margaret is a Junior at our State University at Urbana, Illinois.",

                "Mr. Greenberg was born in 1855 in Hygum near Redding, Slesvig, and in 1881 he arrived in Chicago where he soon found work as a carpenter. Being an able journey-man, he had no difficulty in keeping steady work, and in comparatively short time he had saved enough money to start his own contracting business in which he was quite successful until the depression, following the 1893 World's Fair, temporarily slackened the activities of the building industry.",
                "But the depression could not slacken Mr. Greenberg's energy and initiative, so he made a swift turn from building houses to selling dry goods, for which there was yet a demand. In partnership with S. T. Corydon he started a store on the corner of Fairfield and North Avenues.",
                "However, his devotedness to the trade in which he was brought up, was too strong, and therefore, when times again were favorable for the building business, he sold his part in the dry goods store to Mr. Corydon, and started in anew as a house builder.",
                "In 1907 Mr. Greenberg bought a section of land at the northwest corner of North and Crawford Avenues where he established a real estate office and started to put up buildings on the land which then was an open prairie. \"Wise\" friends, well-meaning rather than foresighted, predicted total failure to be the result out of this enterprise in a section of the city far away from all transportation save horse teaming; but Mr. Greenberg, possessing an unfailing instinct for business developments, unaffected by the opinion of others, carried out his plans and finished within the first year not one but six buildings, which, to the astonishment of his many \"wise\" friends, were fully rented even before they were fully completed.",
                "This was pioneer work in the best sense of the word, and attracted by Mr. Greenberg's success, others soon followed in his footsteps and covered the adjoining sections with modern homes and business buildings. For this new settlement Mr. Greenberg became a much honored and trusted adviser and financier compelling him to add banking facilities and a safety vault to the real estate office.",
                "Then, in 1913, advised and backed by his trusting friend, James R. Forgan, president of the First National Bank, Greenberg founded The Pioneer Trust and Savings Bank of which he became president. This bank has been a most valuable support to the entire neighborhood, and it is well worth noting that this is one of the very few banks, in the outlying districts of Chicago, that stood the test under the 1929-1933 economic and financial depression.",
                "Mr. Greenberg, now a widower since his good wife, Bodil Kirstine, passed away on April 29th, 1932, resides in one of the first houses he built more than 25 years ago, and he is yet busily engaged in managing his properties in the district, which, to the honor of its founder, today is recognized as one of the finest and most prosperous business centers in Chicago.",
                "His time having been fully occupied by his business, Mr. Greenberg has seldom taken part in social activities; but in all fairness it must be said that few men in the Danish colony in Chicago have more cheerfully and liberally contributed to charitable and other worthy causes than Andrew H. Greenberg."

                "Carl Busch, who is generally considered one of the great composers of his age, sits behind a small table in his studio at the Homer Institute.",
                "In a soft voice, almost inaudible at times, he says, \"I have been trying to think of anything that might be a turning point in my life.\" He smiles naively. The very movement of his hands as he fingers a pencil on the table is quite and deferential.",
                "Lying about the studio wherever there is room for them, are antique band instruments, the beginning of a collection to which he adds from time to time. On the walls are pictures--memories. He delights in all of them. With the simplicity of true greatness, he finds as much pleasure in the one which recalls the time he conducted a group of high school bands as in those which recall his contacts with the great orchestras of the world.",
                "\"We don't make much money out of music,\" he says, \"but we have other compensations.\"",
                "For the turning point in his career, we must go back to the Denmark of nearly fifty years ago, and Copenhagen, its capital. Here were more than one hundred thousand persons, the handsomest palaces the country could afford, theaters, and music rendered by the best artists in Denmark, as well as by the great visitors from Germany, Norway, and Sweden.",
                "In one of the large rooms of the Copenhagen Conservatory of Music, a young man with a blond goatee and a sensitive smile played and played his violin. It was a selection from Mozart. To him his gray-stone city throbbed with music, and he loved it.",
                "With his back to the window, stood Valdemar Tofte watching the young student. Tofte was a little man with long hair combed back off his forehead after the fashion of the German musicians.",
                "\"Mr. Busch,\" he said slowly, when the young violinist had paused, \"you have feeling in your music, soul; but it seemed to me that you played not quite so well as last week. This tecnnique you must master if you will be a violinist.\"",
                "The smile went out of young Busch's face. He looked around the bare room, with nothing in it but three straight-backed chairs, a grand piano and cases for music. He looked at the little man before the great window, who gazed at him intently. And then his eyes shifted to the violin in his hand, to the fingers that clutched it, and up from them a little way to the wrist where it joined the hand. There should have been nothing there but smooth skin and the veins showing slightly blue. But there was something else, a small hard lump. It was very definitely there and it was painful, the result of practising on the violin eight hours a day.",
                "\"Yes, I have not been careful enough of my technique,\" Carl Busch said; and he left to go to the room where he studied the beginnings of composition under Niels W. Gade, the greatest composer in Denmark.",
                "He had thought at times that he would like to give some serious thought to composition. One day he might be able to produce a great symphony out of his head. That would be fine. The only trouble was that you couldn't count on anything like that. Whereas he knew that he could play the violin; not unusually well, perhaps, because he had got a late start. But he had learned a lot in the last two years.",
                "It wouldn't do for him to take any chances with his music. He might have to go back into law business as his father, George Ludvig Busca, had originally planned. He did not want to go back to Bjerre, the little village on the east coast of Jutland, where he was born. He did not want to go back to Aarhus, where he had worked in a bank adding up rows and rows of figures day after day. Ugh! How could a man live like that!",
                "These were the thoughts that passed through Carl Busch's mind as he walked along the corriders of the old palace that was the Copenhagen Conservatory of Music. From distant parts of the building came sounds of music, the strains of a violin, a far off piano, a singing voice. And his footsteps struck echoes in the great barren halls. Copenhagen, the seat of music in Denmark! He loved it. He felt a twitch of pain in his wrist and looked down. It was with a deadening sense of helplessness that he remembered his handicap. He had played less well today than he had played a week ago.",
                "That night at his rooming house he dreamed that his hands were cut off at the wrists and that he could not play at all. When he woke up he could hear an orchestra playing in his own head. Short passages took definite form with each instrument playing its allotted part.",
                "Two weeks later Carl Busch again walked through the corridors of the great building, going from the room where Valdemar Tofte taught him to play the violin to the room where Niels W. Gade taught him harmony and counterpoint and other fundamentals of the technique of composition. Gade was a handsome old man, with silver white hair and a vague reserve in his eyes.",
                "\"Professor Gade,\" said Busch, \"I have a lump on my wrist that makes me play the violin worse every day.\"",
                "\"Is that so? It is bad,\" said Niels Gade.",
                "\"I will not be able to play any more for six months or a year. Do you think I could every learn to compose music?\" asked Busch.",
                "\"It is possible,\" said the greatest composer in Denmark.",
                "And through misfortune, Carl Busch turned to the work that has occupied him for nearly fifty years and the worry passed out of his mind. A violinist was lost, but a composer was gained.",
                "A year later this turning point in his career was clinched. He had won a scholarship to the conservatory of music at Brussels, where he was dismissed because he worked on his compositions instead of coming to rehearsals.",
                "With a violin under his arm, he took to the open road leading out across the land of the Flemish in the general direction of Paris.",
                "That evening when the sun was setting he came to a small village. He \"didn't give a hang\" for the serious worries of the world. He stopped in front of a small shop playing his violin. The freedom of the road and the peace and beauty of the countryside were in the inspired music. A crowd gathered; small pieces of money fell around him. Later a tall man who seemed important in the village, asked him to his house to spend the night.",
                "This was the first of many similar evenings. Joyously without any money of his own, he made his way to Paris. There, through his Alsatian landlady, he met Benjamin Godard, the most celebrated composer of France. Besides giving him a place in his orchestra, Godard looked over some of his compositions and advised him from time to time. Carl Busch also played under Charles Gounod in the first performance of his famous oratorio \"Mors et Vita\" (Life and Death). Carl Busch was definitely a composer for the rest of his life.",
                "Paris was Copenhagen glorified. It was a musicians' paradise. It was only because a fire destroyed a summer resort in Southern France after he had agreed to play there, that he found himself temporarily unable to make a living from his music.",
                "Then he heard stories of gold hanging on the trees in Kansas City. What he found, when he got off the train at the old union station, was a gay day and a clay bank.",
                "His \"A chant from the Great Plains,\" a symphonic episode, which won a national contest ten years ago for the best original composition, illustrates the fact that he has caught the spirit of America. That he has been twice knighted, once by the King of Norway and once by the King of Denmark, is evidence of how well he has reproduced the soul of the region of his birth.",
                "\"I don't put music out of my mind when I am through with my work for the day. It still clings to me,\" he says."

                "Professor Marinus Poulsen, violinist, composer, and conductor, was born in Aalborg, Denmark, and at an early age came to Chicago, where he received his education, which he supplemented afterward by a short finishing course in Europe. His teachers were Rabe, Listerman, Falk, and in Europe, Svendsen of Copenhagen. One of his larger compositions is a sacred cantata, \"Love Triumphant.\" In 1923 he won the one-thousand-dollar prize offered by the Chicago Theater for the best tone poem, with \"Four Oriental Sketches,\" conducting its first performance in the Chicago Theater, May 6 of the same year.",
                "Symphonic Poem \"Savonarola.\" This is the first performance of \"Savonarola.\" It pictures the life of an Italian monk in Florence, Italy (1452-1498), who was a reformer and one of the most powerful purifying factors of the Roman Catholic Church. In advance of his time, which was basely corrupt both politically and ecclesiastically, he proclaimed his ideas with unswerving fidelity to his convictions. He was tried upon false evidence with two companions and hanged, and immediately upon death the scaffold with the bodies was burned. The dramatization upon which the musical setting is placed, is by Charles Landrup, and in the execution, the dramatist pictures them as being burned at the stake, the music portraying this sort of violent death. He was later canonized by the church for which he gave his life, and was the direct cause of extensive reform and profound good.",
                "The outlines of this work were sketched in Copenhagen a number of years ago, but the work was not completed until the present time. Mr. Poulsen has given free rein to his imagination in the writing of this work. The work is written in sonata form, and begins with quite an extended introduction and an adagio movement in which some of the themes later developed in the allegro con fuoco are heard. The andante in C Major represents the Savonarola theme, and it is the intention of the composer to picture the sturdy fidelity of the Italian monk to his ideals in spite of all opposition, even death itself. During the turmoil of the development, one can hear this theme running throughout distinctly, even as the pure character of the man was indestructible in success, in opposition, in life and after death.",
                "Four Oriental Sketches. This number is in the shape of an introduction to the numbers that follow. The original inspiration was found in the following verse:",

                "A little chilly errant breeze that stirs the grasses, thrills the trees,",
                "And as it wanders on its way, while yet the night is cool and dark, ere the first carol of the lark,",
                "Its plaintive murmurs seem to say, I wait the sorrows of the day.\"",
                "The Caravan. The intention here is to convey the motion of the caravan, as it stately winds its way across the desert. The swinging motion of the camel is found illustrated in the underlying harmonies. This number ends with the Arab's cry to Allah, as they pitch their tents to rest.",
                "The Temple of Allah. The gongs toll incessantly. This number should be imagined as a prayer to Allah.",
                "In the Balaban and Katz's one-thousand-dollar-prize Symphony Contest for American Composers, ninety compositions were submitted from thirteen different states, including Porto Rico.",

                "Just a word about the sketch, \"A Desert Song.\" A wandering Arab minstrel happens into the camp of the Caravan, precluding in strange and bizarre harmonies a theme of weird outline, following which he sings an impassioned love song, returning at length to the prelude and ending with a wild dance and loud flourish."

                "Hertz loves to demonstrate what he says every one-hundred-per-cent American should be able to do; namely, to stab his leg with a knife without blinking. There is always great applause when the \"Borneo Doctor,\" Dr. Niels Johnson, proposes a toast for \"Hertz's wooden leg\"; this is the signal for telling several stories about this famous leg.",
                "It has been told that Hertz demonstrated the \"knife trick\" at the court of Christian IX, and that Queen Louise promptly fainted. Yes, Henry would do something like that.",
                "For many years, while he had his office in the City Hall (where the weather forecaster's office is), he would compete with Professor Cox in forecasting the weather. Hertz said that he could always feel, days in advance, any change in the weather. And when Cox resigned Hertz applied for his job.",
                "The local writers often referred to Hertz as the \"Chief with the broad blue nose\". He had many such titles. Those he liked best were \"The Old Eagle\" or \"The Bridge Builder\"; it was said that Hertz had built a bridge of culture between Denmark and the United States.",
                "It was Hertz who conceived the idea of an American National Park in Denmark. It was he who bought the broad acres of heather at Rebild, Denmark, and donated it for this purpose. He is on the board of the American-Scandinavian Foundation. He is a member of every worthwhile Danish society or lodge. He is always in the lead.",
                "Hertz is eighty years old, but still very active. Yes, he may live to be a hundred. He has never been ill,except for a couple of times when he was run down by streetcars.",

Almost unbelievable hardships had to be endured by the early pioneer, whose first shelter was usually a cave or an earthen hut and later on a primitive log cabin, miles from the nearest neighbour, and who would think now that in 1853 the voyage from New York to Illinois took 27 days over land and water? The interesting and instructive lecture was made even more vivid by accompanying lantern slides.",

                "A. W. Hansen, also called Sorte Hansen, died in his home on August 12, at the age of fifty-five. He was born in Copenhagen in 1854, and worked at Bing & Grondahl's porcelain factory. In about 1875 he became unofficial secretary to Louis Pio, one of the first Danish Socialist leaders. When the Socialists tried to hold a meeting without the consent of the police, Pio had to flee. Pio was paid 5,000 Kroner by Police Inspector Hertz when he left for New York, and when he arrived at New York he was paid another 5,000 Kroner. Povl Geleff, another Socialist agitator, was paid only 1,500 Kroner in Copenhagen, and he was very much dissatisfied.",
                "Both Hansen and Geleff felt that they had been cheated by Pio. In fact, they claimed that he had sold himself to the capitalists. But when Pio went to Kansas to start a socialist colony, Hansen went with him as his secretary. The project had to be given up within a few months.",
                "Hansen came to Chicago where he got a job with Falker & Stern's porcelain factory. In 1904 he had been with the firm for twenty-five years. He was married twice.",
                "He had a keen mind and a warm heart, and he always was true to the love of his youth, Socialism."

                "The trip over the rapids lasted two minutes and a half, and during about one-third of this time both Mr. Nissen and his boat were hidden by the waters.",
                "Mr. Nissen wore his business clothes as usual and outside these he wore a coat of cork. He was not tied to the boat, since he wished to be free so that he could swim in case the boat were to overturn without righting itself again. Mr. Nissen stepped into his boat at four o'clock in the afternoon and was pulled out into the current by two men in a rowboat.",
                "Having arrived in the middle of the stream, his dangerous course was beginning.",
                "Almost at once the boat was buried in the foaming waves. The keel of the boat, weighing 1,250 pounds, shot straight up into the air as if it had been a little stick of wood, and the boat literally turned topsy-turvy. Both man and boat disappeared beneath the waters, and the people along the shores and upon the bridges believed that he had expired. Suddenly, man and boat shot out of the foaming waters, however; clearly Mr. Nissen had not lost his courage. With his left hand he clung to the boat while with his right he pulled off his cap, waving it to the people.",
                "When finished with the rapids, Mr. Nissen yet had to pass the dangerous Whirlpool Falls. Here the waters circulate at a terrible rate of speed. One gets the impression as if the waters, in an immense fall, are dropping straight into the center of the earth.",
                "The boat was pulled down into the whirling deep; then it reappeared, and again did Mr. Nissen wave his cap. The whirlpool kept him prisoner for forty minutes, but little by little he managed to work his course out toward the outer edge of the pool, and three men, fastened by ropes to stones at the side of the river, swam out toward the whirling waters as far as they dared, and finally succeeded in getting hold of a rope which Mr. Nissen threw to them, and he was pulled ashore.",
                "Women rushed up to Mr. Nissen to shake his hand; men applauded him. He complained that he was freezing; the water was ice cold, and he was almost palsied after the icy bath.",
                "The boat used by Mr. Nissen for his dangerous feat is twenty feet long and four feet deep, built of pine with frame and keel of elm. In addition to the ordinary keel, the boat has an iron keel weighing 1,250 pounds, and the total weight of the boat is over two tons. There is a screw driven by foot power, and the boat has six airtight compartments, two in the bow, two in the stern, and one on each side."

He then started for China and, six months later, after arriving at Hong Kong, he was made a full sailor. He remained there three years trading on the coast of China. Subsequently he was promoted to second mate of a Norwegian ship, and in that position followed the sea about three years. His last cruise was from Hamburg to Philadelphia, and he landed in the latter city in 1875. He worked on a farm in Pennsylvania two months, receiving twenty-five dollars per month, and then started for Chicago, which was the goal towards which many of the emigrants journeyed. He arrived in that city July, 1875, and, taking whatever work was offered, was employed about two onths in a brick yard. He then worked for the same employer on a farm, and in the winter returned to the city, where he found work of various kinds in the Union Stock Yards. He then went to Lake View and hired himself to a gardener,,with whom he remained a year.",

This was the first effort at doing business on his own account, and though at first he had many discouragements, his trade gradually increased, and in the course of two years his reputation as an honest dealer drew to him a lucrative patronage. Three years after his opening the fish market he added oysters to his stock, and has built up a large trade in both lines.

His education was such as the common schools of his locality afforded, and he remained in the vicinity of his birthplace until he reached his majority. In 1864 he resolved to seek his fo tune in America, and following the footsteps of many of his countrymen, emigrated to Wisconsin, settling in Racine. Thence he wandered West and was employed by the Government in the building of fort Lyons, Colorado. In 1867 he came to Chicago, where he worked as a mason until 1869. During that year he suffered from a disease which affected the bone of his left ankle and was obliged to undergo an emputation.",
                "This misfortune disabled him for continuing the work in which he had been engaged and, after due consideration he apprenticed himself to learn the trade of a cigarmaker, with Mr. Burckhart, at what was then No. 33 Milwaukee Avenue. He worked faithfully to learn the business until October 4, 1872, when he had made sufficient progress to open a factory of his own. This he did, at what is now No. 361 Milwaukee Avenue. His business prospered, showing that he had made good use of his apprenticeship, and in 1879 he was able to build a factory and residence at No. 351, in the same street. In this building he has since continued his business, and has aimed to have the model cigar factory of Chicago. In fact it was so pronounced by three experts who were visiting this country from Germany. His output has greatly increased as his product gained reputation and, as early as 1883 he manufactured and sold four million cigars, He employs from sixty to seventy-five hands, and has two men on the road disposing of the product.",

He was one of the organizers of the American Varnish Company, and still owns stock in that concern, which is in a prosperous condition, having in 1897 transacted business amounting to $280,000. He was also a promoter of the Milwaukee Avenue State Bank, is one of its largest stockholders and on its board of directors. Among the other concerns in which he has stock might be mentioned the North Side Street Railroad, the National Biscuit Company and the Chicago Heights Land Company.",
                "He has always taken a lively interest in the affairs affecting the city, and especially the portion in which his home is located. Mr. Hanson has always been a very industrious man, and this, coupled with the most rigid economy in the beginning, accounts for his success in life. While still an apprentice, he was able to accumulate three hundred dollars, and during the first three months of his business career he doubled his investment three times. During the first six years that he conducted business for himself he worked almost night and day, allowing himself no more rest than nature absolutely demanded.",

Both parents, spent their lives in Fyen, his father dying in 1861, and his mother in 1876.",
                "Mr. Pedersen was reared and educated in his native village, where he remained until he was fourteen years of age, and was engaged in farming for a time; then, becoming desirous of following the sea, he shipped as a cabin boy and for many years was employed on board a ship in various capacities. From his native land he sailed to Scotland and Prussia, then to Liverpool, and there shipped aboard a Dutch vessel and sail to Riga, Russia. From there he went to Holland, then took a position on a South American vessel and went to New Orleans, landing in America for the first time in 1860. After a short visit in New Orleans he was employed on the American vessel \"Scranton,\" on a trip to Liverpool. He then shipped on board a Swedish ship, which was bound for Shields, England; and went to Rio Janeiro, Brazil. The ship being southern property, could not get a clearance, so the captain represented that they were going to Cork, Ireland, for orders. Instead he went into St. Thomas, in the West Indies, to learn how the Rebellion was progressing. Then they found three Northern men of war, and the \"Globe\" was held there eleven months. Mr. Pederson remained on board the \"Globe\" eight months and then got a berth on board a Danish vessel and went to San Domingo, from there to Hamburg, Germany, thence to his native village and found that his father had died. He then went to Hamburg and shipped in an American Vessel bound for Shields, England.",
                "Later he embarked on a Prussian vessel, came to New York and cruised along the eastern coast, visiting Baltimore, Jacksonville and Galveston, and then went on a trip to Newfoundland and Nova Scotia.",
                "Returning to New York he shipped on a German vessel for France, touching at Marseilles. On going to New York, they were detained in the harbor at Gibraltar by a head wind for about twenty-four hours. The captain did not know that the law required every ship that had been lying at anchor in the bay to hoist its flag while passing the Spanish fort. Neglecting to comply with this regulation, his ship was fired at from the forts and the twenty-four pound shot struck the railing, passing through, the side of the ship, broke the cook's leg, knocked off a leg of the stove and lodged in a sail locker. The Government sent a tug to take them back into the harbor at Gibraltar, where they had to report to the Consul how the trouble happened, after which they returned to New York. Mr. Pedersen then shipped on a Nova Scotian vessel, called \"Lillian,\" and went to Buenos Ayres, Brazil, with lumber, and from there returned to Boston. After getting his pay he took passage on a steamboat to New York, where he made his home. He then went to Buffalo, New York, and continued his journey as far West as Omaha, intending to go into the mining regions of the Rocky Mountains. Instead he took a trip down the Mississippi River and spent the winter in New Orleans. While on the levee in that city looking for work, he heard a man ask a negro to go to work for him, and at once recognized to voice as that of a Mr. Bruen, who had been second mate of the ship \"Globe.\" He made himself known, renewed the old acquaintance and friendship and got profitable employment with his old friend. In the spring of 1871 he came to Chicago, sailing on the lakes during the following summer. In the fall of 1871 he went to New York and made two trips to Santiago, and on his return visited his brother in Racine, Wisconsin.",

Those of his fellow-countrymen who had emigrated to this country, sent back glowing descriptions of good business openings to be found in the United States, and young Mikkelsen resolved to try his fortune in the Great Republic. In 1871 he made the journey to Chicago, to which city a large part of the immigration was directed, and there found work at his trade. Until 1878 he worked by the piece, laying by as much as possible of his income.",

At the end of that time the partnership was dissolved, each of the brothers going into business by himself.

He now does a large business in the manufacture of clothing, employing twenty-five hands. He has not abandoned the frugal habits of his earlier days, and the results have been correspondingly greater as his income has increased.

He has made a name for himself among the residents of the Northwest Side and has secured the confidence of his patrons. He comes of a foreign country, having been born in Copenhagen, Denmark, May 13, 1865. He was the oldest of a family of two sons and one daughter and was educated in Kristensen's Borger og Realskole.

He finished his apprenticeship in three years at the location of the corner of Lille Kongensgade and Halmstraede. He subsequently entered the service of C.W. Obel, wholesale tobacco dealer, at Udsalg in Frederiksberggade, and was occupied one year as shipping clerk.",

He belongs to Ivanhoe Company, Uniform Rank, in the Knights of Pythias, of which he is treasurer.",
                "He is a self-made man in every sense of the word, and deserves credit for the fact that he showed the courage to enter a new, and to him, wholly unknown country, without much knowledge of its people or characteristics, and without friends. He has a fine practice that has been steadily increasing. He took out his naturalization paper in the Superior Court in December, 1893, and while he honors his mother country he is loyal to his adopted country, never forgetting that we owe our first allegiance to the country in which we make our home."

He remained in that country until he reached the age of twenty-two years, when he resolved to seek his fortune in the United States, and accordingly crossed the Atlantic to Portland, Maine. He spent one year in that city, finding employment in a picture frame factory, and receiving one dollar per day for his labor. In 1866 he removed to Boston, where he secured work, similar employment. Hearing of greater advantages for ambitious young men farther west, he came to Chicago in 1867 and at once secured work. He proved to be industrious, and continued working in various factories, carefully saving all he could, and learning as much as possible of the business ways of the country.",
                "In 1871 he resolved to start in business for himself, and, with this in view, formed a partnership with David Goodwillie. The firm began the manufacture of picture frames, and a year later Mr. Goodwillie's sons took his place in the firm, this partnership continuing until 1874. In that year Mr. Hanson and nine others bought out the Goodwillies for $3,400, and remained in the business until 1877, when the subject of this notice was able to buy out his partners and take entire control. Thus, by diligent attention a to his work, he became owner of a growing business, which, under his careful personal management, has increased to a wonderful extent. Having begun at the bottom round of the ladder, he is familiar with every detail of his establishment, and is thus able to give instruction and advice wherever needed. Several departments have been added to his factory and he now manufactures various articles, besides mirror and picture frames and mouldings. Some of the largest barber shops in both East and West have been fitted up with furniture manufactured by Mr. Hanson. In October, 1898, he made and shipped a large barbers' case to Johannesburgh, Africa. In his business career, Mr. Hans a has not been without his discouragements. In 1880 his entire plant was burned, including tools and machinery. His courage did not abate, however, and, within three days he bought an entire plant and continued his business at No. 151 Washington Street. In 1883 he had so far recovered his loss that he was able to build his present large and commodious plant at Nos. 136 and 138 North Curtis Street. This building is one hundred thirty feet by six feet in dimensions, and in it are employed about ninety hands. In the year 1892 they received the sum of $40,000 in wages. The product of this factory is well known all over the country, and is sold from Maine to California.",
                "In May, 1870., Mr. Hanson was married to Miss Caroline Nortensen. Six children have been born to this marriage, all of whom are living at home and all were born in Chicago. Their names in order of birth are: Maria, Martin, Lizzie, John, Rosa and Louis. They have received the best of educational advantages and have all been carefully reared. Their home is a fine residence at No. 668 North Hoyne Avenue. This house was first built in 1879, but was re-built in 1891.",

He recognized the broadening influence of travel, and has visited many scenes of interest both East and West.

He was an influential member of the Danis Evangelical Lutheran Church, and his absence is greatly felt by all his fellow-members.

Mary is traveling agent for a wholesale millinery firm of Chicago; James B., formerly of the bicycle firm of Thorsen & Cassaday, Chicago, is president of the Thorsen Company, dealing in bicycle material; John is clerk in a retail boot and shoe store; and Peter is agent for a bicycle firm. Mrs. Thorsen is prominent among the Danish ladies of Chicago, and is foremost in charitable work. She was the leader in the movement to organize the Danish Old People's Home Association, to Build a home for the aged Danish-born citizens of Chicago, and it was at her house that the first meeting of the society was held, March 12, 1891.She was its first president and has been its treasurer seven years, and was recently elected an honorary member of the association by acclamation. The society is now getting ready to build a home, having, after years of patient effort, secured sufficient funds for the purpose."

                "William Mogensen, though a native of a foreign country, is a notable example of what may be accomplished by that untiring energy and thrift for which Americans are justly noted. He was born in the city of Copenhagen, Denmark, June 26, 1864, and is the son of a butcher of that place. He received the advantages of a common school education, supplemented by a course in a high school. At the age of fourteen years he entered his father's shop to learn the trade, and put forth every effort to become a practical workman. He continued in his father's employ until 1886, when he married and opened a shop of his own, which he conducted successfully about four years. He had already shown an aptitude for business, and in 1890 left his native town, traveling directly to Chicago, where he knew many of his fellow-countrymen had found comfortable homes and good business advantages. Having acquired but little knowledge of the language and business methods of the city of his adoption, Mr. mogensen was not able to take up the business for which he had already fitted himself, but was obliged to seek some form of manual labor. His determination to succeed, however, made him welcome any form of honest employment, his first attempt being as a hod carrier. He subsequently worked five months for the Illinois Central Railroad Company, and six months for Marshall Field. He saved his money carefully, at the same time doing his best to master the English language, age, and in 1892 was enabled to open a meat market in Armitage Avenue. His capital at that time amounted to but sixty-five dollars, and some idea of the success of his business may be obtained from the fact that his present stock is valued at ten thousand dollars. To his skill as a practical butcher is due to small amount of his success, but the greater part must be attributed to his rare business sagacity and persevering energy. Though at first his business was necessarily small, he soon won the trade of the best people in his locality, his judgment in the selction of goods being of the first order. He had served an apprenticeship in all branches of his trade and as his business increased, he began packing meats, and manufacturing various meat products. He found a ready sale for these and has a good trade among other retailers in the northwestern part of the city. In 1898 he bought the building at No. 759 Armitage Avenue, so that his establishment includes three buildings. Nos. 755,757, and 759, in that street. As Mr. Mogensen is still comparatively a young man, it is easy to predict for him continued success and the accumulation of a considerable fortume.",

                "Lauritz Paulsen, who has been identified with the building interests of Chicago for many years, comes of that strong, aggressive Scandinavian stock which has played such an important part in the World's history. He was born in Denmark September 16, 1853, and in his native town received a common school education. At the age of fourteen years he was apprenticed to a carpenter and, for a period of five years, diligently applied himself to learning the trade. He continued to work as a carpenter in his home town until 1881. In that year he followed the tide of emigration which had been flowing strongly toward America several years, and journeyed to Cleveland, Ohio, where he found work at his trade. Hearing of the greater opportunities for gaining wealth in Chicago, he went to that city the next year, and was employed twelve months by Palmer & Fuller, in twenty-second Street.",
                "Like all other men who have acquired fortunes from small beginnings, Mr. Paulsen had early adopted frugal, economical habits, and had always saved a portion of his earnings. He was, therefore, able to enter business on his own account and, having by his two years' residence in this country gained a knowledge of American methods of building, he resolved to apply his efforts in such a way that the profits should be his own. He therefore began buying lots, on which he erected residences. These he sold at a fair profit, and the plan was not only advantageous to him, but also aided in building up the city and furnishing comfortable homes for many of its people. This business was continued until 1893, and resulted in the erection of about fifty houses. With part of the capital thus acquired, Mr. Paulsen opened a lumber yard in 1894 at No. 781 North Avenue. He carries in stock all kinds of lumber required by the builder, both for rough and finishing work. He long experience in superintending the work of building and also as a practical mechanic, render his judgment in the selection of materials as good as the best, and he is patronized by a large number of the first-class contractors in his section of the city. He is the owner of the property where his yards and office are located, and also of a modern residence.",

Not only has he acquired a competence, but has become an honored and respected citizen of his section of the city, where his honesty and integrity are well known. In politics he shows that same independence of character which has marked his business life, but in national affairs he supports the principles of the Republican party. He was married in 1881 at Cleveland, Ohio, to Miss Marie Lassen, a native of Denmark."

He secured his education in the seaport town of Copenhagen and being brought into contact with many who either followed the sea or gained their living by ocean trade, he began to look forward to a sailor's life at an early age. When but fifteen years old he became cabin boy on a Danish vessel which carried him to England, where he changed to an American ship bound for New York. He continued on the sea until he reached the age of twenty-five years, and by strict attention to his work, coupled with a desire to excel, he rose to the rank of mate.",
                "In 1870 he resolved to suit a sea faring life and having a natural liking for machinery, he apprenticed himself to learn the machinist's trade. He applied himself faithfully to the business for a period of three and one-half  years, and became very efficient in this line of work, and decided to make the machinery of hat factories his specialty. He worked in various like establishments in New York City ten years.",

Mr. Lawrence became one of the most skillful men in his line of work and was able, by due care, to accumulate quite a capital from his earnings. He therefore concluded to enter business on his own account, where his ability in that direction could have greater scope. With this end in view he opened a liquor store in 1895, and has continued the enterprise since. The venture has proved satisfactory from a financial point of view and has considerably bettered his fortune.

                "Capt. Christopher Johnson, one of the old landmarks of Chicago, who arrived in this city as long ago as 1838, was a native of the little kingdom of Denmark, and was born near Copenhagen, October 3, 1819, his parents being natives of the same locality. His father was killed by an accident before Christopher was a year old, and the latter was bound out to a farmer on the island of Als. Imbued with the strong love of the sea which has filled so many of his countrymen and made them famous as sailors the world over, at the early age of fourteen years he shipped at Sonderburg, Denmark, on board an ocean vessel, and within the next two or three years had sailed around the globe. In the winter of 1837 he found himself in the city of New Orleans, and, having long desired to verify the statements he had heard of the advantages America offered to industrious, enterprising youth of all nations, he left his ship, and started for the heart of the country. After reaching St. Louis, he went to Peoria, in this State, whence, by means of a hired team, he reached the city.",
                "Mr. Johnson's employment after reaching what was then the muddy little village at the mouth of the Chicago River was as a member of a surveying party; but he served thus only a short time, and soon after sought the more familiar and congenial life of a sailor on the Great Lakes. On one occasion, while on a trip on one of the Lower Lakes, on a vessel called the \"Maria Hilliard,\" he was shipwrecked and met with other mishaps. But on the whole fortune favored him; and after a few years' service as a common sailor, he was able to buy a small schooner, the \"Helena,\" and took charge of her as captain. In 1849, while coming with a cargo of bricks from Little Fort, near Kenosha, the \"Helena\" was sunk near the Rush Street Bridge. On her voyage to Chicago, she had sprung a leak, but by the efforts of the captain and crew, she had been kept afloat until the city was reached. After raising his vessel, Captain Johnson sailed her for some time longer, but in 1853 concluded to give up sailing for good. His life on the lakes had given him a pretty fair insight into the lumber business, and in this he embarked, remaining thus engaged until the Great Fire, when, in common with innumerable others, he lost almost his entire savings. Fortunately, however, he did not lose his residence, which was then on the West Side. He was the owner of a farm at Lemont, and he moved his family there for a time. His handsome new farmhouse was destroyed by fire two years later, and he built another.",
                "Captain Johnson had married in 1849, and for the next twelve years he reared his children on the farm. He retained the real estate he had owned in Chicago previous to the fire, and had added to it, and at the end of the twelve years he removed his wife and family to the city, finding here greater scope for himself and promise of future occupation for his sons. His property interests increased to such an extent that his time was fully taken up in managing his private affairs, and he never entered any other business. During all his life in Chicago he lived on the North Side, where he was universally known and popular with all. He built his first home on the corner of Ohio and Market Streets, a spot which he then considered the most prepossessing in the city. His objection to the South Side was due to its mud, that portion of the city being almost impassable in the early days on account of its level. At one time he intended to buy the land on which the Briggs House now stands, but after considerable deliberation concluded the site was too muddy, a succession of mud holes having to be crossed to reach it.",
                "Captain Johnson's widow, who yet survives, was previous to her marriage Miss Emily Raymond, a daughter of John and Louise Raymond, a native of Copenhagen, and was born September 1, 1833. At the age of ten years she came to America with her father, who was a ship-carpenter. He followed the lakes until his death, which resulted from an accident he met with while in the pursuit of his calling, being caught and crushed between two ships. His death occurred some months later, at the age of forty-five years, August 11, 1853. Mrs. Johnson's marriage occurred in Du Page County, this State, near Naperville, December 9, 1849, and resulted in the birth of thirteen children, of whom the following are living: Maria Louise, Mrs. A. Nelson, of Chicago. Lena Amelia, Mrs. John S. Lee, of Lemont; Evelyn, Mrs. D.T. Elston, of Chicago. Henry W., living in Socorro, New Mexico; Benjamin Franklin, of Pomeroy, Washington; Charles Christopher and George W. Johnson, of this city.",
                "In politics Captain Johnson was an ardent supporter of the Republican party, and his party's candidates were never defeated by his failure to do his duty at the polls. During the early years of the Civil War he served as Collector of the North Town, but a naturally retiring and modest disposition kept him from ever being conspicuous in politics. In religious faith he accorded with the Lutheran Church. The respect in which he was held was shown at the time of his death, which occurred September 28, 1895, within a week of his seventy-sixth birthday anniversary. He had been an enthusiastic member of Cleveland Lodge of the Chicago Freemasons, in which he was initiated June 11, passed July 7, and raised October, 13, 1859, and his fellow Masons attended his funeral in a body. His early life had been full of incident and adventure, but his later years found him quietly fulfilling the duties of a self-respecting, honorable life."

                "Mr. Antonsen's attorney, Mr. Miles, then called his witnesses. Antonsen had been smart enough not to give his case to any of our half-witted Scandinavian attorneys; he had secured the services of the native-born Mr. Miles, who, if we are to judge by the size of his nose, has Semitic blood in his veins.",
                "Mr. Miles began his questioning, and the words light fingers and light-fingered rained down on the court.....The judge tried to arbitrate the case, but Antonsen would not consider such procedure, and his answer to the judge was,",
                "\"Not by a damned sight.\"",
                "This case of \"honor dishonored\" appears to be one of those which can go on and on. Alas for Antonsen! Alas for Botker!"

                "Carl Hansen writes an appeal to all Danish societies to unite at least once a year for the celebration of the Danish Day of Independence, which is June 5th every year. He knows that it is very hard to get the Danes in Chicago to unite; there is too much jealousy between the different societies and the different individuals. But once, in 1899, the Danes got together and celebrated their National Day in a proper manner, and the result was the biggest gathering of Danes every seen outside of Denmark, a crowd of 10,000. The Danes in Chicago ought to elect or send delegates to a permanent National Committee; this was also the case in 1899, but the president, Niels Juul, was attacked so violently in The Danish Pioneer that he gave up, and dropped the whole thing. This year it will be 60 years since the Danes got their own constitution in 1849. The occasion will be celebrated on June 6."
