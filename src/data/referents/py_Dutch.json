                "In the carrying out of my various duties, I occasionally have to make use of the surface lines to convey me from place to place. It was on one of these excursions, that I chanced to meet an acquaintance and naturally we began to chat about this, that, and the other thing. After having come to a rather definite agreement about the state of the weather, and having disposed of such major problems as the conditions of the roads and the quality of the street car service, we drifted to less important topics. One statement of my fellow passenger struck me with much force. He said rather boastingly: \"I ain't done no readin' since I was tooken' out of the sevent' grade and set to work.\" He intimated, upon further questioning, that now he sometimes managed to glance over the headlines of the newspapers, but that further \"learnin' was not for him.\" I sympathized with the man. I have myself been unable to get the education I desired. But due to the sacrifices and idealism of my parents I have been able to secure, at least, some training, meager though it may be. I sympathized with my companion for I could realize, in a small way, what he missed. He was blind to so many beautiful things in nature; his mind was closed to so many truths of God's revelation; he was compelled to live almost on bread and water alone. The most tragic of all was, that he felt that his condition could not be bettered, that he was past the \"learning\" stage. For today it is more true than ever before, that is never too late to learn. To be sure, circumstances do not permit everyone to attend our schools and colleges, but there are so many agencies existing to-day that enable one to acquaint himself with the arts and sciences during his leisure hours. Our sturdy fore-fathers, though they were hard-pressed with the care and toil of eking out a bare existence, yet found time to acquaint themselves thoroughly with the best that was in religious literature. And now the working day is shorter and the opportunities for advancement are much greater. There are the bookshops selling books and periodicals for prices within reach of us all.",
                "There are the libraries with their priceless store open to all, so that \"he who runs may read.\" There are the correspondence courses, sponsored by institutions of every kind. There are the night schools offering courses on every imaginable subject. These opportunities are open to all who wish to take advantage of them, quite different from the class systems that exist in European countries and are, most fortunately, almost non-existent here. I think it is our duty to make use of the many opportunities offered us to train our God-given minds. We should not permit the field of our intellect to lie dormant. It is encouraging to notice, that among the thousands who make use of the evening schools of our city, there are also a few of our young men and young women. But can not we ourselves do something along this line? The Union of Christian Schools is planning to give correspondence courses dealing with normal training. Why should this work not be extended? Our Mission Training School has for some years now, offered evening classes on various subjects aiming at preparations for missionary work, and may are taking these courses. That is a step in the right direction. Sometime ago I overheard one of the Christian High School teachers (I think it was the Professor of Science) speak of having evening classes in the high school building on whatever subjects might be in demand. And why not? The building is there; the equipment is there; and I am sure that the teachers would be willing to add to their present heavy load - one or two evening classes per week. If the plan is worthwhile it could be carried out now. Perhaps the new Principal, when he has had sufficient time to acquaint himself completely with local conditions, can take this up with the faculty and the Board..For we all must do our share in helping those who, though they have been prevented by circumstances previously, are now doing their best to better themselves intellectually so that they may assume a more influential position in the complex life of which they form a part.",

Everyone so it seems, had his or her own method of spelling.",

And these examples are by no means exceptions. Similar tests in former years have proved, that at least fifty per-cent of all the students at North-western are poor spellers. And because the students hail from different States and in some cases have studied at some well known institutions of learning, we must take it for granted that the general method of teaching is faulty, for if it were good, it would bring better results."

To Dr. James. F, Chvatal, a member of the committee on school management, which has control of instructing personel, it was the limit. He simply refused to serve as a member of the Committee, because at the meetings there was nothing done but talk. To quote his own words: \"The committee gathers at 4 p.m. and talks, talks, and talks, until every one is hungry and then keeps on talking, until it is time for evening - tea. And when it is all done, then what has the committee accomplished? It speaks for itself that they love to talk and enjoy it, but such a Democratic talk fest is too much for me.  I have enough of it.\" It is possibly superfluous to say that this committee has a chairwoman instead of a chairman. It is Miss Jane Adams, who is responsible for those coffee-klatches. But that is not all. The daily papers have been filled lately about the new \"benefit plan\", by which the instructing personnel gets increases in salary, not through being higher grade, but as the result of longer service. Naturally there is also a woman in this play. It is Margaret Haley, who took the initiative here, They called in aid of the Chicago Federation of labor, to help her in the re-organization of the \"school - system\", and as this concerned the introduction of union methods in the school system, this aid was soon available Under the so - called Haley plan, introduced by Trustee Post, the instructing personnel is divided in two classes, satisfactory and unsatisfactory.",
                "As long as an instructor is not scratched off the satisfactory list and is not fired on account of that, regardless of how little knowledge he shows, his salary is raised from year to year, until the maximum is reached. The task of calling a teacher unsatisfactory, becomes through this, dangerous for the principal, who is responsible for them. And a principal, who has the courage to brand a member of the instructing personnel as \"unsatisfactory\" may prepare himself against a \"strike\" or \"slugging\". The result will be, that as long as a teacher, pays his or her monthly contributions to the union those teachers will stay on the list of the\"satisfactory\". For this the \"union\" will be responsible. If this is not playing with the interest of education, then we do not know. When a union card is sufficient evidence of the skill of a teacher, and is sufficient proof to assure the increase of their salaries, then the citizens of our city should ask themselves, whether or not they entrust their children in dangerous hands.",

                "According to the daily papers, the United States Supreme Court, the highest court in the land, has recently made an important decision, namely, the language question in the lower grades of schools, a question in which many of us are interested. No less than five convictions in three different states were set aside by the Supreme Court and those who were sentenced were given a clean slate. These convictions were over the use of the German and Polish languages in the lower schools. The Hollanders, it seems, during and after the war, have nearly everywhere sacrificed their language and cowed down before lesser officials. The Germans and Poles in many places did not follow suit. Hence the arrests and convictions of German and Polish teachers in Iowa, Nebraska, and Ohio. The Supreme Court has brought to naught all the convictions and its decisions were in accord with those convicted. The opinion of the Supreme Court finally gives the right to different religious organizations, and individuals, to teach religion and other subjects in languages other than English. This means that we can now instruct in the lower schools in all the courses in Dutch or German or Polish or any other language. A courageous decision! Hurrah for American Liberty! May she live long. We are not for Dutch schools exclusively. That would not only be impossible, but it would be a crime against our children. It would be ungrateful to the land. It would be unpatriotic and therefore the American language should be first in our lower schools. But we do not want to be bullied and bulldozed by certain school boards who tell us how our children should be raised and what should be taught them. The Dutch have too much backbone for that. They want to be led and convinced, but not browbeaten. They want to be good Americans. They do not want to separate themselves from the nation. Instead, they want to share their gifts and blessings with the nation. But we will not throw our children head over heels into the maelstrom. The Dutch want their children to be as themselves and to maintain a spiritual tie with their ancestors, as long as the period of assimilation may last. They also want to leave to their children their spiritual treasures. In order to do this, they need as an instrument their own language. They wish their children to understand their language and to be able to give them the training of church and home as they have promised to God. That is why it is also a crime against parents who need the Holland language to raise their children, to take it from them, and most of them who come here are in advanced years and they need it whether they admit it or not, whether they are ashamed of the Dutch(as is often the case with that sort of people) or not. They need it to give to their children in the home a Christian and Calvinistic training. There is also another difficulty. There are many, especially if we deal with unwilling teachers, who say that they need all the time to teach English. My eldest son attended a German Christian school for several years. Since his second year, he has studied German. The children had to study hard and had homework every evening. At home the boy learned, through the maid who is largely responsible for his upbringing and also of his father, Dutch, and at school, German and English. Now in our Holland Christian school, his standing in English is 97 1/2. Where there is a will, there is a way. We must become Americanized,without a doubt, with heart and soul, but we must also hold to our spiritual tie with our forefathers. I am therefore happy because of the decision of the Supreme Court. As an example of the arguments of the Supreme Court in its exceptional and interesting decision, we give here the main case that was brought before the court. A certain teacher in a parochial school in Nebraska by the name of Meyer, taught the children of his class in the German language. Meyer was convicted by the courts of Nebraska for the unlawful teaching of reading in the German language to a child of less than 10 years of age and who had not yet passed the eighth grade. The accused and the other convicted teachers with identical cases appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States on the grounds that instruction in this language was necessary to the child for its spiritual well-being. Appeal was also made to the 14th constitutional amendment, that is, it is unlawful to bereave anyone of his life, freedom or willbeing, without lawful due process of law. The Supreme Court ruled against the courts of Nebraska and agreed with Meyer that knowledge of the German language in itself was not detrimental, and that Meyer had the freedom to instruct in that language and parents have the right to teach their children thus. The high court upheld the right of the state to supervise teaching and to see that good Americans were made. In this we also agree with the court.",

This committee presented to the president a petition which was the result of a great and noble movement over the entire United States, and which was signed by well-known men from every corner of the country. The Holland Society was so good as to give me a copy of the petition, as well as a complete copy of all signatures, plus a letter written by ex-President Roosevelt signifying his whole-hearted sympathy with the movement.",
                "The petition is a masterpiece; written on eight folio pages, it is a credit to the composers and the signatories alike. At the start it was signified in good and plain language what was meant by the petitioners: \"We, the undersigned, either of Dutch birth or descent, or sympathizing with all just causes which tend to promote a better knowledge of the Dutch nation, its history, art, literature, and language, among the American people, humbly petition you to establish a chair for the study of Dutch history, Dutch literature, and Dutch language at the University of Chicago, said chair to comprise also the existing subdivision of Dutch art of the Department of Art at the University.\" This is in short the entire purpose of the petition and of a movement which found favor among men of reputation over nearly all the United States.\" This purpose is now further clarified, and to this clarification is devoted the entire contents of the petition.",
                "The meaning of this petition and its broad clarification should not be underestimated; we are convinced that, in future days, it will be protected as an important document in the history of the Dutch in America. The [falsehood of the] accusation often made against the Dutch, that they are too sectarian, too narrow-minded, too selfish, ever to be able to co-operate for a Dutch national purpose and much less to seek the best that the Dutch, with their glorious history, could do for the American nation, is clearly illustrated in the petition. The fact that nearly six hundred signatures are attached to the petition proves that the broad understandings inspired by national consciousness have not in the least been undermined by partisanship and sectarian frugality. When I, being in America only a couple of months, and having been introduced in most American circles, read the petition for the first time, it was as though a current of enthusiasm and love for the glorious past of our nation went through my soul. May it please God, I thought, to do right by the Netherlands in the great center of the American nation; so that, through all the good that has been accomplished by that nation, we may serve to a higher degree than heretofore and work as yeast within that great nation which is in the making between the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans.",
                "How boundlessly were men praised many times in this land, how often were they held up as examples and showered with love, men who could not conceivably rank with our Father William, with our De Ruyter, with our Rembrandt, with our Vondel, and with so many others.",
                "Only on the first and most famous men of America, only on Washington and Lincoln, was the honor bestowed of being likened unto William the Silent by the best historians. And then consider that long line of great men in every walk of life who have played a role in the Netherland's glorious history, in all those fearful struggles of the people of the Low Countries to acquire freedom of religion, freedom of Protestantism for the entire world all those struggles to reach the highest point on the economic field and in the field of knowledge.",
                "Is it not beautiful for the Dutch heart, for the American of Dutch descent, yes, for every genuine American, to know that a long line of earnest men are busy with a movement to make Dutch history, art, and literature better known in the center of American national life? To create a chair of learning for that purpose in one of the Dutch Colleges, either in Hope College or in the Theological School at Grand Rapids, would in a way be a superfluous luxury. There, Dutch History naturally plays an important role in the exclusive circle of the Dutch. But this was not the purpose of the movement and of all those men who have felt the inspiration of it. The inspiring thought with which those men were possessed did not point to a certain circle of our own people, but to the American nation and the blessing which is contained in the glorious past of the Netherlands as a people, encircling in its entirety all parties and elements in every walk of life where this nation has founded something noble and great.",
                "There is a blessing for America in the history of every nation whose thousands of emigrants found a new fatherland within her borders, and it is the holy obligation of each nationality to actually pass that blessing, providentially entrusted to it, on to the American nation.",
                "In this perspective there is laid a great and noble task upon the shoulders of the Dutch. The men who have signed this petition have felt it deeply. In the preamble of the petition we read: \"They ask, as American citizens, that the deep lessons in the history of the Netherlands, the sonorous strength and majesty of the Dutch language, and the classic beauty of its prose and poetry, as well as the brilliant art of Holland and Flanders, be taught at your university. They ask, as American citizens, about this instruction, because they earnestly believe America needs such instruction, needs to know the example of her sister republic, and, as it becomes a great nation, needs the inspiration of the ideals and exaltation that flow from Dutch history, Dutch literature, and Dutch art.\"",
                "It is clear that the men who signed the petition did not consider their task limited to only one great university in America.

                "Most of our newspapers have reproduced the article on the administration of the Chicago division of the General Dutch League, concerning a Chair for Dutch language, history and literature at the University of Chicago. This proves that the efforts to secure such a Chair of learning, are appreciated and that the idea is supported. Among the papers which have copied the article, we notice the Pella Weekly, The Wachter, De Vrye Hollander, De Gids, of Grand Rapids, and De Grondwet. The Gids, of Grand Rapids, a Christian weekly, dedicated to family, community and State, and undoubtedly one of the best edited Dutch newspapers in America, published the article with the following recommendations:",
                "A CHAIR OF LEARNING IN DUTCH",
                "We may recall, however, that a couple of years ago, tremendous efforts were exerted in this direction. The Chicago Division of the General Dutch League sponsored this plan. Although it was unsuccessful at first, yet, it was not discarded by the trustees of the University of Chicago, and has once more come to the fore.",
                "Now, however, conditions are much more favorable. The article concerning this matter, which we have copied from Onze Toekomst, can be read elsewhere in this paper. We supported these efforts two years ago, and we have not changed our opinion in the least. Our old Fatherland, with its glorious past and its present prosperity deserves a chair of learning for the aforementioned courses, at a university in our land. We know that in many circles, the importance of the Netherlands in the world's history is not known; \"The Dutchman\" is often talked about with contempt. It is even so in circles of Hollanders, who apparently do not know any better. The educated circles of America know better as may be distinctly perceived at the University of Chicago. Otherwise such a plan would have been ridiculed. Also those among us who are familiar with the works of Campbell and of Griffis, know better. We, here in Grand Rapids, still remember the work of Dr. Griffis. We do not know of any possible objections, especially when a man, like Dr. T. De Vries could occupy that Chair. It is natural that we would like nothing better, than to see this position always occupied in the future by a true Calvinist. Then, such a \"Chair,\" could wield a great influence upon our Christian people. Whereas, the spiritual influence would be negligible if ever an unbeliever were to fill this Chair. Our people would not let themselves be swayed by such a professor, unless their faith becomes considerably weakened. The plan seems, to us, to be and excellent one. We hope that the necessary money, may soon be available. The rich life of Netherland's language; the significance of the principles of Christian freedom, and the treasures of Dutch knowledge and art, all these facts should be brought to light, for the good of our National American life."

                "Mr. Editor:",
                "In your paper of September 21, there appeared a letter concerning public education. In this, it is declared that the citizens must pay sixty dollars per year for each child, while the cost of Christian education is only $20.00. Now I would like to know in what manner this money is paid. I have two children going to school, and I assure you that I do not pay $120.00 in Taxes per year, although education must be paid for from that source. I am at the same time, of the opinion, that no-one pays that much, unless he owns real - estate, representing that value. Now it happens only too often, Mr. Editor, that in order to defend one's own case you make another good case bad, which I think is the situation here. To believe the report of your paper, I must first be convinced. Hoping that the editor will do this, I thank you in advance for the publication of these lines Greetings: C.B.Koop. The only thing that pleases us in the above article, is, that the writer hopes to be convinced. In this we will try to serve Mr. Koop with figures, he will then possibly be convinced that he does not nearly pay enough taxes, and at the same time that it is dishonest and wrong to be forced to pay for the rearing and education of another's children.",
                "To our sorrow we have no accurate figures on the cost of our public schools, covering the last two years. The last published report, covers the years 1903-4. That year, the total of school - going children, was 220,384. To pay for their instruction, the amount paid to teachers, for schoolbooks, etc. was $7,339,844.44, or approximately $33.50 for each child. For building, $1,944,370.73, or about $9.50 per head. For interest on borrowed capital $115.512.40, being 50c per head with a total of $43.50. To this is not yet a added the salaries of janitors. etc. For this you can safely figure $5.00 per head. That would only be a total of a little over a million. Then we must not forget that the gentlemen of the school board also get plenty, and that there is a large staff of clerks, book-keepers, etc. We will nevertheless, stay at the low figure of $5.00, and we come to a total of $48.50. Now last, but not least, and of this neither the City nor the school - board, ever makes a report, the real - estate belonging to the board. What do you think, if on all the real estate, belonging to the Board of Education, which they themselves use and rent out, a tax was levied, like on all other real- estate, within the city limits, would that not make a large sum? And where these taxes are not levied and where all so - called school property is tax free, then we must figure that the citizens donate this sum to the Board each year. If the real estate belonging to the school - board, were taxed according to their real value, that would be an enormous sum. Let us also figure $5.00 per head on that. That makes then a total of $53.50. But you would say that is not $60.00. That's very true. But these are the figures for the years 1903-4. Since that time the teachers salaries have been increased and at present much more is paid out for school books, and last but not least, more than twice the amount is spent for school buildings. If this in 1904 amounted to 9 dollars per head, this year it will easily be $20.00. On top of this, there is rumored, that the Board will borrow this year $10,000,000. That, we think, closes the case. If, with such figures, the instruction of each child does not cost $60.00, then we confess not to have learned arithmetic. Now, Mr. Koop must not forget that he does not pay alone for the education of his children. Those enormous holdings, for which each year, thousands upon thousands of dollars are being collected in rents, are the property of the citizenry. The person, who, because of his conscience, cannot make use of the public schools, is also a co-owner. And he also contributes to the taxes, from which the cost of public education is being paid. That is not right. Every fair - minded person will concede that, under - stand us rignt. In making these remarks we do not go to war for Christian education. Every one has a right to his own principles, regarding this matter. Onze Toekomst holds itself outside such questions. But we assert that public education is an expensive luxury, and that it is unfair that this instruction is being paid for from the general fund, as long as there is any refusal to support parochial education."

On that day the new school - building at 59th Avenue and 14th Street, Cicero, Ill., was dedicated with fitting ceremonies. At 4 o'clock in the afternoon a program was given for the Third Christian Reformed congregation. The Rev. J. J. Weersing functioned as the main speaker and others, who were gifted, contributed with their talents by singing and playing instruments. After the finish of this program, those present went to the new schoolbuilding, where a tasty meal, prepared by the \"Eunice Circle.\" awaited them. Approximately 300 people, who were interested, participated in it. After the meal they went to the second story, where the assembly hall is situated. It has a seating capacity of 500, but was inadequate to accomodate all who came so that about 300 had to be satisfied with standing room outside the hall and in the balcony over the entrance. A song service was first held in the balcony after which the program was commenced. The main speaker of the evening was the Rev. P. A. Hoekstra. Following this was the report of the chairman of the building committee, T. S. Youngsma. Further, other speakers took part in the program and the rest was illustrated by music and song.",

                "The spacious corridors and rooms of the Chicago Christian High School resembled ant hills, Tuesday, September 6th. All was activity. No sluggards were in evidence. For two months the doors of the school had been closed. Now, vacation was over and the boys and girls again found entrance. Tuesday morning the new students appeared. Naturally they were awed by their new surroundings. However, they regained some of their composure when they realized that being registered was not an unduly painful procedure after all. The older students came in the afternoon. It was interesting to watch them greet one another. It was amusing to see the seniors strut around as if they were in undisputed possession of the place. Registrar Lietzema has made a careful analysis of the registration and the reports that some sixty new students have entered the C. C. H. S were made by him. The total enrollment is 199 pupils. This, if my mathenatics are not faulty, is only one less than the two hundred mark, and perhaps the two hundredth student is even now \"signing up.\" Mr. Lietzema finds that of the 199 there are 107 boys and 92 girls. There are 141 enrolled in the general and 58 in the commercial courses.",

                "Two Christian school societies of Roseland, (Chicago) which have existed side by side for over thirty five years, have decided on the evening of May 2nd to reorganize and, henceforth, conduct their affairs under one Board and under one administrative head. According to the Christian School Yearbook, the \"110th Place Christian School Society\", is one of the oldest existing school societies in America. It was organized in 1884. The pupil enrollment which began with twenty-four, is now listed two hundred and sixty-nine. Seven years later, in 1891, the \"104th Street Christian School Society was organized. From an initial enrollment of 25 pupils, the present enrollment is almost four hundred. Being in close proximity (the two schools being less than a mile apart), the two societies have put forth repeated efforts during the last thirty years to bring about an amalgamation. We are glad to report that the recent efforts put forth in this direction have been crowned with success. From a business point of view it is not difficult to point out, that is is comparatively easy to build up a strong organization when we can select the best organizing talent of two existing school societies. It is also obvious that one large organization can operate more efficiently and more economically, than two smaller organizations operating independently of each other. The greatest benefit, however, which we hope to derive from the union of our Christian educational forces in Roseland, is of an educational character. In the past our Christian schools, as well as our people, existed quite independently from American life. Being removed from American life our schools could arrange their affairs in innocent seclusion. Times have changed. At present our Christian schools must take a place alongside our public schools. Their buildings, equipment and educational standards must compare favorably with the buildings, equipment and standards of our public schools. If we, as supporters of the Christian schools, do not insist upon a certain equality in these respects, then our schools will become objects of reproach, not only for those who do not sympathize with the Christian school movement but also for our rising generation. Because of our present close contact with American life and its educational institutions, our Christian schools must, at least in a general way, be able to compete with the public school as educational institutions or else we find ourselves compelled to abandon our educational activities. To speak in more concrete terms, our schools must be able to stand the test of State inspection. They must be accredited by the State authorities. This means, that in the eyes of the public school authorities our schools must be in a position to give instruction which, intellectually considered, is on a par with that of the public schools. It goes without saying, that the educational standard as at present maintained in the public schools, is due in no small measure to the size of the school system. If each public school was an independent unit, its educational standard in a large degree would be undoubtedly much lower.",
                "In view, therefore, of the principle that in union is strength, the Christian educational leaders in Roseland have educational efforts in this part of our large city along co-operative lines. This recommendation of the two roseland school boards was concurred in by the respective school societies,each of which considered the amalgamation proposal on the same evening. A splendid attendance characterized both meetings. There were about 120 members present from the \"110th Place Christian School Society\". Although we did not make a close count of the number present, at the 104th street school meeting, we venture to state that, at this meeting, there was an even larger attendance. This could be expected in view of the fact that the latter society has a larger number of members. Under the leadership of J. Bosch, President of the \"110th Place Christian School Society\" and A. Zwitzer, President of the 104th street Christian School Society,\" a good spirit prevailed in the two separate meetings. And the motion to unite was practically unanimous at both meetings.",
                "Undoubtedly one of the reasons why the plan to join has met with little of no opposition, is due to the fact, that both societies are finding it difficult to finance their school enterprises, if not in the way in which they are now operating then, at least, in the way that these enterprises should be operated in the near future. Because of this fact we wish to call attention to a possible danger. This danger, as we see it, is three-fold. In the first place, there is a possibility that a number of people of both societies, may be of the opinion that the merging of the two societies, will somehow open up a new source of income for financing the school and, for that reason, it may be thought that less money need be contributed. Now it may be possible to stop up certain financial leakages, nevertheless, let us bear in mind that the reorganization of our forces be it an an improvement in efficiency, as such, is not strictly speaking adding to the sources of our income. Insofar as money is needed, it must come from our pockets. Our people, you and I, are and always will be the sources of our income. Organization, management, is at best only a means or method of obtaining such money. A second possible danger resulting from the union of two societies may arise from the fact, that in the eyes of some, the reasons for contributing may seem less potent. Having grown up with a certain school, (one of the schools has a history of almost half a century), one becomes attached to such a school and its organizations. As a matter of loyalty to one's particular school society, one has added reasons for making financial contributions. Besides, wholesome rivalry between two local school societies is often a powerful factor in making financial sacrifices. If, however, such two societies become one and are operated under a new board such motives, as those just refered to, become largely ineffective. If our people, however, contribute to the cause of Christian education as a matter of principle, out of love for God and out of a deep abiding interest in His kingdom, then, I say there will be little danger that with the loss of a certain sense of private ownership there will be a corresponding loss of a sense of personal responsibility. Finally, and this possible danger is based on the two mentioned - by concentrating our educational efforts in one instead of two school organizations, we are in danger of removing the school from its constituency. Our Christian schools rest upon the principle that the parents are responsible for the education of their children. To carry out this responsibility, parents must ever be in close contact with their school and co-operate with the school authorities in an intimate as well as an intelligent manner. Now it is an undeniable fact that, in proportion as a school society becomes larger, there is a tendency on the part of the individual society member to become less and less informed in regard to school affairs, and there is a tendency on the part of the school board, to operate the school on a more independent, if not autocratic, basis. Naturally, this tendency is apt to become more pronounced when two comparatively large school societies merge into one. These matters have, of course, been duly considered by our local educational leaders. And we doubt not but that the new board will take the necessary precaution to offset this dangerous tendency. Personally we believe that by means of a strong publicity program, including frequent interesting, stimulating, society meetings, parent- teacher's meetings, effective committee work, (house - visitation), etc., the necessary contact between the school and its constituency cannot only be maintained but can be strengthened over and above what it is now. May God's blessing rest upon this important decision. May the merging of these two long established Christian school societies be the occasion for injecting new interest and enthusiasm in our local school activities. May God especially endow the to-be-elected board with the necessary wisdom, so that in the future it may become, that the union of these two societies has been conducive to further the interest of Christian education in these parts and, thereby, promote the cause of God's kingdom.",

                "As soon as I received the request from Mr. Ribbler for this article, I decided that I would undertake to give a few facts about the registration recently concluded. We have an enrollment at the present time of 177 pupils, distributed as shown in the following chart (chart seperate). Of course these figures can be analyzed in many ways with varying interpretations, but the outstanding facts are indicative of general growth for the period covered. The total enrollment has increased by 61 per cent during that time, a good portion of which is in the commercial department. It must, of course, be noted that this is also in great part responsible for the increased percentage of girls to boys.",
                "The relation of Reformed to Christian reformed has not been materially changed, but the number of those coming from other denominations has been increased from two in 1923, to nine at the present writing. These include five from the Norwegian Lutheran Church, one from the Christian Church and three from Mission enterprises. From the standpoint of classes there are eighty-two students in the first year of work, forty-five in the second year, thirty-three in the third year, and seventeen in the fourth and final year.",
                "It can readily be seen that the new building is no only desirable but imperative. We felt crowded in 1923 with 110 pupils, now we feel smothered. Fortunately, the end of this period is in sight, and we shall enter into a new era. How much this will mean to the institution, only those who have attended here can begin to realize. And perhaps not any so much as those who have attended in the previous quarters on Loomis Street. Of that group of pupils and instructors only one teacher and one pupil are still in our midst, namely Miss Hammekool and Anna Wieringa, who have returned to complete the work. Credit for the outstanding increase must of course be given to the West Side and Englewood, which have doubled their number of students since that time. Roseland and the outlying districts have always been well represented, but have not evidenced the same percentage of growth. Perhaps a word of explanation is necessary about the distribution to the general and commercial courses in 1925, where 136 are shown as enrolled in the general and only 10 in the commercial course. This is not entirely a true statement, as among those taking general studies were a good many who intended to take up commercial work, but could not by reason of the limitations in equipment and facilities. This will be seen readily in the figures of 1926 where a more normal ratio is maintained.",

                "Occupying a prominent place in the catalogue of subjects for conversation among the pupils of the Chicago Christian High School is the new building. It holds unchallenged sway in the realm of student thought. It determines the trend of any lengthy conversation and, seemingly conscious of its power, inspires all with unquenchable enthusiasm. Perhaps we do not feel to the fullest extent the scrifices you are making for us. In fact we know we do not. Nevertheless, we are not entirely unconscious of the burden we are bearing. This is evidenced by the fact that a drive was recently inaugurated by the equipping of the school,-more specifically the gymnasium. It was at a school gathering in a neighboring hall that the plan was first introduced. The proposition was met with instant acclaim and the eager interest evidenced at the meeting did not expire with time, but grew stronger as the campaign drew to tits close. Not till the last coin had been gathered in did it forsake its lofty level. The students have done remarkably well. Five dollars was the sum each was asked to bring. Only one condition was imposed, that the money brought should be earned \"By the sweat of the brow.\" It was, in many case with difficulty that the student was able to raise their quired amount. Some enterprising young men sold books, others sold papers, beat rugs, delivered orders, cleaned sidewalks, and engaged in all sorts of heretofore unheard of occupations. By tending children, sewing, serving, and engaging in other kinds of feminine usefulness, the girls succeeded in making their five dollars. Then the energetic young women adopted more advanced tactics and began business on a vaster scale - the cake sale grew into being. The gentle shower of hard earned silver now turned with the shifting winds into a varitable deluge. The campaign is over and more than $900 lays ready to be spent for equipment. Because of his capable management of the drive and his inspiring personality, Mr. Swets deserves a large share of the credit for this achievement. Miss Hammekool deserves special mention for her able direction of the cake sales. The sympathetic appreciation evidenced by the entire faculty and Board was a tremendous aid in the accomplishment of this feat. We take this opportunity to thank our mothers for their splendid co-operation in freely furnishing all the pastry for the cake sales. Above all we owe thanks to Him who is the giver of all good gifts.",

                "I had just settled down for a comfortable evening, last Wednesday, when my eye happened to alight upon an item in Onze Toekomst telling about a debate between the Chicago Christian High School and the Grand Rapids Christian High School to be staged at the Second Christian Reformed Church of Englewood. Distances are so long in Chicago and the fire-side was so attractive, that I somewhat dreaded venturing out. But my previous visits to the school had aroused my interest to such an extent, that my conscience would not permit me to stay home.",
                "I made the trip to listen in to the debate. I got there a little early and overheard some of the boys and girls talking about a basket ball game of the evening before with Pullman Technological School in which, as the girls put it,\"our boys licked them, 22 to 6!\"",
                "The High School youngsters seemed quite happy about it. The debate was on the question whether or not the Philippines should be given their complete and immediate independence. The Chairman of the evening was the Reverend Brat. The judges were Dr. Heyboer, Mr. Bere and Mr. Van Heyningen.",
                "The Chicago Christian High School was represented by its affirmative team composed of Henrietta Geerdes, Henry Stob, and Peter de Vries, while Howard Westing, Reinard Harkema and Melvin Minnema debated negative for Grand Rapids. What a contest it was. The debaters rolled out six-syllabled words as easily as I could use words of one syllable. They waxed eloquent about the justice or injustice of further retention, about the social, political and economic conditions, that did or did not permit of independence. And the Chicago debaters won by a unanimous decision of the judges, 3 to 0!",
                "I had enjoyed the evening so much, that I could not resist the temptation of going again the next evening to hear Chicago debate the Holland Christian High School representatives on the same topic at the Fourth Church of Chicago. There Mr. George Ottenhoff ably acted as Chairman. The Rev. Bel, Dr. Jonker and Mr. Flokstra served as judges. This time Henry Stob, John Rottier and Peter de Vries of the local High School met Edwin Heeringa, Betty van Vliet and Edward Fisscher of the Holland Christian High School. Again they went at it tooth and nail. The boys seemed able and willing to settle the whole problem of the Philippine Independence once and for all. My only regret was that the members of Congress were not in the audience, so that they might receive some light on this momentous issue. After what seemed to be an interminable time the Chairman announced the decision of the judges. And again Chicago won 3 to O! As I left the building I heard one of the students say, \"Our's is a nice school, our's is!\" Meanwhile the negative team of Chicago was making a tour to Holland and Grand Rapids. Helen Zwiers, Anna Geerdes and Robert van Kampen made the trip to foreign fields to meet the affirmative teams of Holland and Grand Rapids. At Holland our team vanquished their opponents by a 3 to O vote. That made three unanimous decisions for Chicago. The next evening, however, they met a 2 to 1 defeat at the hands of Grand Rapids.",
                "It certainly was a great week for the Chicago Christian High School.",
                "Due credit must be given to the debaters, to the entire school and, more especially, to the English department for the marvelous showing that was made. The High School has been signally blessed. The community has been shown, that in the Chicago Christian High School it has a school in which it may well take pride.",

                "It chanced, last Tuesday morning, that I turned my steps to the neighborhood of 69th & May Street. The newspapers had announced that vacation days were over for many thousands of school children in our land.",
                "And we had been informed from the pulpit and by church papers that our Christian schools, too, were to open their doors on September 7. Since my duties required my stay for some time in the immediate neighborhood of the Christian High School, I could not withstand the temptation to nose around a bit. I saw virile youngsters open the door and disappear up the stairs of the school building. I saw what I took to be teachers, now and then, step through the same entrance.",
                "It was after considerable internal turmoil that I finally drew up enough courage to enter the building after them. I had known the former principal, Mr. Fakkema quite well, and for a moment I expected to see him there, but then I remembered that he had undertaken the difficult task of general secretary of the Union.",
                "No sooner had I reached the head of the stairs then I saw the familiar figure of Mr. Dykema, the custodian. For years, now, he has helped to make the students feel at home, and I noticed with interest that both boys and girls grouped about him and greeted him with a hearty Hello Pa! The new principal, Mr. Brjema, I had seen in Roseland once or twice before, But now I wondered how he would handle the situation at school, and I must say, that I was favorably impressed with the expedition and efficiency with which the many problems connected with opening school, were met, under the new administration. It was evident that his colleagues were cooperating wholeheartedly. By this time one of the teachers spied me and very kindly showed me the various rooms and answered my many questions, though they must have seemed somewhat childish to him. I learned that the high school was offering a general course, a teacher's course, a scientific course and a two, three, or four year commercial course.",
                "It was told to me that Miss Bode was the newly-appointed head of the commercial course. And when I got a good look at her I felt that the Board had made a wise choice. Miss Hammekool, Mr. Sietsema, Mr. Swets, Mr. De Boer and Mr. Mauw were back for another year, and the teaching staff again numbers seven. Naturally, I wanted to know whether the school had grown, and I was glad to hear that more than fifty new students had enrolled, and that the total enrollment was now one hundred and sixty students at the least. It has become necessary to have some classes come in the morning and others in the afternoon until larger quarters are secured. (The teacher said something about a \"two shift idea,\" and according to my present understanding, that might have something to do with automobiles, but I did not want to show ignorance by asking about it). What a contrast with its beginning in the old church building at 72nd and Loomis streets. When my guide began enthusiastically to speak about the new building, that was being built at 71st and May streets. I determined to see that also, since I was so near it, anyway. I went my way there with a gladdened heart.",

Heeding this request, we ask the Synod to recommend that in all our churches a yearly collection be taken up for the Union of Christian Schools, preferably on the Sunday before the yearly meeting of the Union, which is held shortly before the opening of the Schools in September. The reasons for this are that our churches have a great interest in Christian education. The growth of the Christian School movement in our land, in our judgment is the foundation of a healthy and reasonable development in church life. We deem it proper, that the collection be taken up just before the annual Union meeting, (shortly before the time that the schools are reopened), because at that time attention is paid to Christian education. The Advisory Committee instructed the Synod to grant this request, and the Synod concurred. On account of this the Christian Reformed Churches are being requested to act according to the decision of the Synod. Mr. Fakhema, who writes about the case, announces that a collection will be highly appreciated, the more so because this year a deficit is in sight. We hope that the brothers, who spend so much time and talent on this worthy cause, may be made happy through generous contributions from the churches.",

                "Answer to Mr. P. Termaat regarding the teaching of the Dutch language in the Christian schools..... Herewith, we give a reprint of the articles of the laws governing teaching. This law governs the teaching in the elementary grades. By elementary grades, we usually understand the grades from 1 and including 8, and sometimes 1 to 6 or 7, but in each case, it includes the grades 1 and 2. The motion which was debated by the society Ebenezer was in two parts. The first part proposed that the teaching should be in Dutch for the first two years. The second part proposed that the Dutch language be kept in the higher grades as a course. Where the teaching is the same the first 2 years as in the first two grades (where teachings are given in the elementary branches of education.) it would absolutely be against the law to teach the Dutch language as it was proposed in part one. That the Dutch language, as a course, was not against the law was disputed by no one and yet the amendment to the motion to teach Dutch as a course thru all the grades was rejected. We say this to show that the meeting was unwilling to import more Dutch at the expense of the language of the land.",
                "As to the remark that the case was handled onesidedly at the meeting, we must say that there were more arguments against than for the motion. It was not the president's fault but that of the meeting. In our opinion, every one who had anything to say in regard to the motion was given an opportunity to do so. True, everyone was restricted to speak twice on the same motion, but that was the same on both sides. Anyone who feels slighted by the president may appeal to the meeting for justice. No one though made any use of this right. As far as criticism about the membership of the meeting is concerned we can say that only members of the society participated in debate and voting. Whether or not it would be better to set a minimum age for members is another question and had nothing to do with the honest handling of the discussed question. Lastly, there is a difference of opinion concerning the place which the Dutch teaching should take in our Christian schools. Every one has the right to plead his own convictions and if possible convert others to his point of view. If, however, the Society comes to an agreement then we feel that further agitation will be a detriment to the well-being of the school. If the importation of more Dutch was absolutely essential to rule the Christian character of our schools, it would be different. The Dutch language, however, is not a real part of Christian worship. Personally, I am in favor of the teaching of the Dutch language in the lower grades. The following is an article written by me in Religion and Culture in 1925 -- \"The Americanization of our people of Holland descent is making rapid headway, but to a large number of our children, Dutch has not yet become a foreign tongue. Because of favorable home and church environment (favorable to the acquisition of Dutch), it is comparatively easy for our children to master the Holland language. It is certainly far easier to acquire the Holland language than a foreign one. Does it not seem shortsighted and lacking in a preciation of a rich legacy to ignore the language of the Motherland? Is it not withholding something from the children to which they have a right, and if we deny it to them, will they not one day censure us for denying them the key to a vast spiritual wealth, the key to a culture of which they are products, the key to a literature -- especially theological which we consider invaluable? As it was then, so is it also my position now.\"",

                "Many good people are withholding their support from the Christian school movement, because, as they say, they do not wish to play a losing game. The Christian schools, according to their way of thinking, are bound to peter out. This is the way they size up the Christian school situation. The idea of the Christian schools has not only been imported from the Netherlands, but the whole educational system of the Christian school is characteristically Dutch; as such, it is foreign-outlandish. This being the case our schools must die out with our Holland churches. Progressing in the Americanization movement spells decadence in the Christian school movement. Discard the Dutch language and you bury the Christian school. Do these predictions agree with the actual history of our schools? Let us see. Those who are somewhat familiar with the history of our Christian school know that the schools have passed or are passing through three rather definite stages of development.",
                "In their first stage, the Christian schools were Dutch schools. The teachers were Hollanders, rather than Americans. Thought was conveyed by means of the Dutch tongue. The teaching methods, the customs and manners were largely, if not entirely, Dutch. Even the ideals held up to the children were often more foreign than American. Regrettably, this is the picture which many of the opponents of Christian education have of the Christian school, even to day. They seemingly do not know that just as a child outgrows its childish prattle and childlike ways, so also the Christian school movement had outgrown the Dutch language and the Dutch customs. (Those which still devote sometime to it, largely teach it as one of the many subjects in the curriculum.) In these schools the tendency is to make the study of Dutch elective. In its second stage of development the Christian school movement is marked as being largely a church affair. Our schools, though not in name, were in reality parochial schools.",
                "The pressure which was brought to bear upon our people in behalf of the Christian school proceeded from the church, and was done largely for the sake of building up the church. The leaders of the church were also the leaders of the Christian school. The institution of the school was subordinate to and existed for the institution of the church. Sad to say, our schools have not yet out- grown this church stage. Some schools must still become free - free Christian schools. It is, however, a hopeful sign that those schools which are blameworthy in this respect are struggling hard to free themselves from the ecclesiastical stigma.",
                "The third or final stage of our Christian schools can be characterized by saying that our schools are American free Christian schools. They are American -American in the sense that they are constitutional, willed by our country, being expressions of religious freedom - that glorious privilege of which Americans will always boast, as long as the America to be, develops in a manner consistent with the spirit of the American which was. Again the schools are American in the sense that they hold up American ideals, that they teach true love for our country, and, in the same sense, that they foster a loyal citizenry, and doing all this in a far more effective way than can be done in a religious educational institution. The Christian schools, in their highest development, are free free in the sense that they strengthen both state and church. Instead of proceeding from the state ( as do the public schools), or from the church (as do the parochial schools), the Christian schools owe their origin, their maintenance, and their management to separate societies, called in to being for that very purpose. Furthermore, the Christian school, in its last stage of development is Christian - Christian in the sense that the spirit of the school, its teaching and its discipline are, in a deep going fundamental way, conditioned by the word of God. Such has been the development of the Christian schools; from Dutch to American, from parochial to free. As Dutch families our people migrated to America, but in due time, by natural development, these Dutch families became American families. How could our schools fare differently, inasmuch as each school represents a group of families. In our next article we hope to take up the expansion of our Christian schools in a more thorough manner. M. Fakkema."

The object of the Board shall be to constitute unity in teaching in the different schools. Through this Board much good is expected; through the medium of this board a moral course in ethics will be opened and opportunity shall be given to Christian teachers to better condition themselves by attending the lessons at Englewood on Saturday morning. So you see, dear reader, that Christian teaching here makes steady progress. We are striving constantly to better the schools for their cause.

Dekker that at present 190 children are attending the school and that the current expenses for this year will amount to about $5,400.00, making $1.60 a month for each child.",
                "The committee made a motion that the school-fee for each child should be put at $1.60 per month, and that a supplementary fund should be created for the support of those parents who are having many children at school and who are not able to pay the full amount.",

During 1912, our school turned out nineteen graduates, of whom some went to high school, others to business college, and, naturally, a certain number went to work and occupied places in stores, offices, and workshops. Of the graduates who went to other schools to obtain more knowledge, we heard that their standings are O. K., and in that way these schools give evidence of the standard of our instruction.",

A storm of protest went up among our Dutch people, when Mr. Vander Ploeg, gave vent to his feelings in such a rude way, about the Hollanders and their schools. Despite this the Dutch public until now, has not given him a fitting answer.",
                "True, there were men who acted as interpretors for us in Onzetoekomst, but upon those interpretations much can be improved. We Dutchmen must answer for ourselves. We must do this in large numbers. But our answer must be Christian, and to the point. God's business has always been resisted, is always being resisted and will always be resisted. Yet this resistance is beneficial to the Christian, we must have something we can fight for. The life of a Christian is a wear of faith. In this war we do not call each other names. but we pray and work. Works of faith and salvation. Let us then not be angry with Mr. Vander Ploeg, but let us pray for the man, who denounced Christian education so bitterly and untruthfully.",

Our schools give better education and better bringing up of our children than the public school, but our school buildings are far behind the public school buildings.",
                "The public schools have money in abundance, while our schools are poor, thus the most decisive answer to Mr. Vander Ploeg, is to dig down in our pockets and to see that our schools are remodeled and that our teachers be paid more and regular. We must not be a Christian and Hollander by word of mouth, but also with our hearts. When Christian education is a matter of our heart, then our pockets open automatically. We do not progress by rejecting some one elses principle, but by placing our own principle foremost and then live accordingly.",

Van der Ploeg, at the dinner of St. Nicholas Society, in which the Hollanders in America, especially if they are supporters of Christian education, are being put on trial in such a way, that cannot pass unnoticed.",
                "To my great pleasure, I noticed that Onzetoekomst already reflected on it, in its issue of December 25, in which unreservedly takes up the challenge for Christian education, concerning the reprint of the speech, which appeared in the Record Herald, cited in a broad sense in the above mentioned number of Onzetoekomst.",
                "The speech of Mr. Van der Ploeg brings out the following points: 1. That the Dutch in America are of a very poor origin. 2. That as a result of this they are backward and even unable to grasp the meaning of education. 3. That the establishment of Christian schools is the ultimate consequence of this.",
                "4. That the Christian schools are entirely misplaced and unfit to make Citizens, fit for our American Nation. First we draw your attention to the fact that we champion the name Christian schools against, (as they were referred to by the speaker): Parochial and Private schools. Our Christian schools are not parochial nor private, they are rather the only institutions for elementary education, which can claim the title, Free Schools.",
                "The speaker stated that the Netherlanders who emigrated to America are of poor origin, that is largely true. It was not often that luxury brought them to America, that is certain, but nearly always betterment of their position, which made them take this long journey, for the rumors that came from here were always encouraging and continually tempted others to come to America. Wonderful opportunities were to be found in America,it would be foolish for any person to pass them up. Therefore it is improbable that their poor origin was the cause of being backward and unable to grasp the idea of higher education.",
                "It is a known fact, that once established in this country, seeing that the manacles of poverty had fallen off their hands, they advanced far beyond those of other nationalities. Or do you think this is an exaggeration? Let us then turn to the facts.",
                "If it is reasonably correct that Chicago has a population of 2,000,000 people of which 20,000 are Hollanders, this would constitute 1% of Chicago's population. Now study the telephone directory, take carefully from it all the Dutch names, multiply them by 100, and you will find there would be need for a much larger directory than we have at present. Go still another step down the National ladder and compare their love for freedom. This battle for freedom was fought by the Dutch people as a whole, as well as by the individuals and this battle goes on unabated.",
                "Back in the sixteenth and seventeenth centurys, they fought for religious and political freedom, and from the Netherlands, the Reformation spreaded over Western Europe, its influence was felt far beyond.",
                "It is that love of freedom, which has grown indestructible in the Dutch people. When through the French revolution, unnatural and unbearable bonds were made, then the freedom-loving people could not be held in check, and in 1834, at the separation of church and state, freedom of the church was anew acclaimed. Meanwhile something happened that can be called something new in history. Until now the battle was waged in spiritual, political and national terrain, but the task of making education free had just begun. Our youth was being considered. Elementary education had until now been more or less checked. At first it was Rome, and after the Reformation the Reformed church also took possession of education, and tried to use it to its own advantage. Then came the reaction, and the schools became state-property, and education was not free, except where the free school was established.",
                "In the Netherlands they are becoming increasingly popular and the public or state schools are gradually becoming the exception whether the free schools are Christian schools, makes no difference.",
                "The other parties have the same opportunity, but on this point they seem more lax, for when it came to a fight for freedom. The free school is yet in its infancy, and if it is true, as is being claimed that this century is for the child, then you will realize that the child can no longer be tied by unnatural bonds, and they will give to him the freedom to which he can legally lay claim. This can only be accomplished in a free school, which is under the control of the parents. The child belongs to the parents. When a child is born it becomes a member of the family, and the parents have the right, and are responsible for the entire upbringing, and it is an abuse, when the state says to the parents: You are responsible for the entire bringing up of the child, except his education for which I am responsible because it can not be entrusted to you. But the parents who understand their full responsibility, will not turn them over to the state, but will undertake to educate their own children.",
                "This proves that Mr. Van der Ploeg was wrong when he declared that the champions of the free school, stood in the way of freedom and progress.",
                "It is just against the enemies of the free school which we are protesting, they are too conservative, too backward on the problem of education to realize, (as the speaker said), the new order of things. I deem it improper to reply to the last point of the speaker, namely that the above mentioned schools are unfit to make good citizens for our American nation, for two reasons. The first because this case was made plain in Onzetoekomst of December 25, 1908. Second because, as Onzetoekomst rightfully pointed out that this teasing is too low, and the honor of the free school demands that we remain silent on that score. I wish to make only one more remark, namely, the entire of Mr. Vander Ploeg speaks of thoughtlessness and carelessness.",
                "The speaker is well known as a famous lawyer, and has the undivided trust of the entire Dutch element and his influence reaches to far beyond that. Correctness and completeness always earmark his work and it is continually to his honor to do everything complete. It remains a puzzle to the undersigned, how a man like Mr. Vander Ploeg, without studying the case in the least, could make a vicious attack on the Hollanders pet Jewel, as though it were only trash.",
                "I also appreciate the value of the public schools but that is no reason why we should throw our ideals overboard. We trust that Mr. H. Vander Ploeg will confess that he missed the ball, and if such is not the case then he will reply to the above article.",

It is your privilege to differ with me on the question of the value to our people of parochial schools and you also have the right, both as an editor and as a individual to criticise my views upon that, or any other subject. But your statement in reference to me personally, that I cherished a deep and venomous hatred against the Christian education of our young people, caused me to denounce all that was dearest and best in them, is without any foundation or excuse.",

Among many other things I said is the following: \"It will not do to say that these schools are necessary for instruction in the Holland language, or for the purpose of reading the Bible in the schoolroom. The Bible may be and is usually read deily in every well regulated family among our people. In addition to this, the parents who advocate and support these parochial Schools, usually send their children to Sunday School, Catechism and other Church services. Many of them I am forced to say, often make Sunday Service irksome rather than interesting and pleasant for their children, at least it was so in my boyhood days. Let us confess that many of these practices and usages are followed, not from a sincere desire to worship God, but rather because they have been so practised and handed down to us from father to son. We are creatures of a habit, and adaptation to a new environment is often difficult and tedious.\"",

The progress of the world, the change from the old to the new, our adaptation to the new order of things, is the very essence of our existence. And again: We want to see another descendant of our heroic race become the chief executive of this nation. Not as a distinct Hollander, but as a type of that strong, wise and progressive American Citizenship, that dares and dares again, yes, always dares - with which the possibilities of our race are so pregnant. We do not know what victory or defeat, what success or failure, what glory or shame may be in store for the people of our new and adopted country; but we can rest assured that the men and women of Dutch blood and their descendants will help to maintain and defend its free institutions with that same spirit of self-sacrifice, devotion and valor, which in the 16th and 17th centuries preserved to them the independence of their native soil and won for the people of Holland, the lasting Why then, did you detach a small portion of my address, and then state that I abused everything that was dear to our Holland people? I have always upheld the good name and glory of our nationality and have always been proud of the fact that I am a born Hollander. My voice has ever been raised and my efforts are always directed for their advancement and welfare, not perhaps as you see it, but as I honestly understand it.",

It is entirely superfluous to defend parochial instruction against such crude attacks. Parochial instruction itself, and the fruits which it yields, here as well as in the Netherlands, are above all such criticism. In the Netherlands, people have given up that type of criticism for some time past; here, where this instruction is of relatively recent date, as is everything else in this country, people dare to place it in a wrong light. It is principally for that reason that a word of protest is not altogether superfluous. This is what the speaker had to say:",
                "\"Coming as these people (the Dutch immigrants) do from different parts of Holland, and chiefly from small villages and country districts, where wages are low and the necessities of life dear, they arrive here with very fixed notions and prejudices, which are often the result of their birth and environment instead of a sound education and wise judgment.....I am afraid that the majority of them are also opposed to the study and adoption of what is best in American life and manners. They seem to have such fixed notions and habits that it is difficult for them to realize the new order of things. They wish to continue to measure and to judge things by the standard of the home they have left, and not of the home they find.",
                "\"So extreme is this obstinate adherence to Dutch customs and usages, that our worthy Holland people establish Dutch parochial schools in many places, and would, if they could, establish exclusive small Dutch villages or settlements, even in our large cosmopolitan cities. It is usually only the poorer people who send their children to these schools, and so, besides paying their share of the taxes for the maintenance of our splendid public schools, they are also burdened with the support of these little private schools, which are usually poorly equipped. It is seldom that a school of this character has a competent teacher. As a rule he is not proficient in either English or Dutch, and seldom indeed in both.....The result is that the child must unlearn in later years what he should have learned correctly and well in his childhood, and is at a disadvantage for years to come, because of the time thus foolishly spent.\"",
                "And so the speaker continues to heap nonsense upon nonsense. The last sentence, with which the speaker concluded his demonstration, is especially curious, and indicates how thoroughly he \"understands\" his subject. Indeed, how can a person, at an elderly age, forget that which he should have learned as a child, and thus, which he has never learned? A more impossible conclusion cannot be imagined.",
                "His whole reasoning indicates that the speaker is completely uninformed on the subject of parochial instruction; otherwise he would have acknowledged the fact that the teachers in our parochial schools have grown old in the service; that our parochial schools, no matter how recently they may have been built, are turning out young men and women, who have been prepared for life; who are second to none of the children of the public schools. The speaker should have mentioned the fact that heretofore the parochial schools, due to lack of sufficient forces, offered instruction only as far as the seventh grade. Therefore, the Dutch students had to continue in public schools, and in competitive examinations carried off prizes, proving that they did not need to forget that which they had never learned. Then he ought to know that generally the teachers in our parochial schools are well matched (in both English and Dutch, if you please) with the teachers in our public schools, whose teaching, even for the greatest advocates of our public schools, is pronounced to be, to put it mildly, \"inadequate\"; and he ought to know that teachers in parochial schools are accepted without teachers' certificatesby necessity, and last but not least, that the teaching personnel of our parochial schools teach from principle and conviction, and therefore are inspired with an enthusiasm for the work which cannot be found in the public schools. Then he should know that the renascent Netherlands has to thank the parochial school for its development, and that men like Kuyper and Bavinck, who have even come to America to explain the development of the reform movement, belonged to the first advocates of national parochial instruction.",
                "As we mentioned at the beginning, the parochial school does not need to be defended against such foul imputations. But we wish to emphasize particularly the fact that the future of America depends on its continuing to permit national parochial instruction of the youth of our people. If you take away the Bible and the doctrine of salvation from our children, your penal colonies and prisons will be enlarged.",
                "Let our people cling a little more closely to the old Dutch principles. It will not do them any harm. Our Dutch people here in America are not surpassed by any group in the sphere of knowledge and science, or commerce and industry. Only--and is this an offense?--our Dutch people do lag behind so far as the number of criminals and drunkards are concerned. Of more than 20,000 native-born Dutch living in Chicago, not more than ten ever come in contact with the police. These are our Dutch people, who lag behind and stand in the way of other people, Mr. Van der Ploeg. Beat that record, if you can!",
                "But it is not our desire to discuss this nonsense any further. It is really not our business, because, according to Mr. Van der Ploeg, the ministers, alone, are basically to blame, and we do not have any claim to that title.",
                "Furthermore, the speaker says: \"In many of the small Holland settlements in Illinois and elsewhere, that I have observed, there is a lack of public spirit and enterprise which should be foreign to people of our nationality. And I am not afraid to say, for nothing personal is intended, that this spirit of self-sufficiency and smugness is often due in no small part to their leaders, and especially their ministers, to whom they look for guidance and of whom they expect so much.\"",
                "That closes the door for further dispute!"

What was known already, was shown by the report of the committee which was appointed at the last meeting, that the diploma's given by the Christian schools would only permit one to enter the public high school, when a specified course of study was made, according to school Superintendent Cooley. The Board of Education would then send an inspector, who would sign the diploma's. A committee was named, consisting of the principals of the different schools and a delegate from each one of the school-societies which until now have had no principal, to formulate such a plan. It was decided to question the different school-societies, whether it would not be to their advantage to formulate a union of the various societies and to form a central committee, which would handle matters of universal importance, and at the same time would place all the societies in Chicago on an equal footing."

Jacobsma, who functioned as master of ceremonies, opened the meeting and requested the singing of Psalm 105:5, after which he requested Dr. P. Moerdyke to lead in prayer. After the opening formalities, the Rev. H. Harmeling spoke masterfully before the meeting on the topic \"The positive confession of God is necessary in the teaching of children\". Following this the chair was given to Mr. A. Bulthuis, who with a few proper remarks laid the cornerstone of the new building, after which the meeting sang loud and clear Psalm 100:4, now the chair was given to Dr. P. Moerdyke, who made a beautiful speech in the English language, and his topic was: \"Christiam instruction a necessity for good citizenship\". The last speaker on the program was the Rev. C. De Leeun, who spoke about Christian instruction and the knowledge, which speech was outstanding through its simplicity and clearness, after which Rev. E. Breen led the meeting in a prayer of thanks to God. The Christian school on our West Side has progressed remarkably during its existence.

                "In Roseland, for instance, there is a school, a public school, where they want certain things done. The city however considers such expenditures unnecessary, so a way has been devised to raise the necessary money. The children will perform a \"drill.\" The majority of the school children, as well as parents and others who are interested, must pay admission to see the show. A great deal of money has already been collected. The sponsors of the public school system certainly support the principle of public education,regardless of how inadequate that education may be.",
                "We also have our parochial schools, consecrated to Jesus Christ, who died for suffering humanity, and yet it is difficult to collect money for our schools, for our parochial schools. Our churches are full to overflowing on Sundays. When I think of the meager financial support given to the parochial schools, I am forced to ask: \"Christians, what evidence do you give of your Christian beliefs? Do you imagine that simply by going to church, you are giving evidence of your beliefs? Do you not know that the seed of Christian life is a war against the [secular] world, which is a world of sin? In the public schools they are teaching the children to dance, and other such immoral practices. Using our parochial schools as weapons, we must war against the evil that is being disseminated among the children in the public schools. Therefore we say, Prove your faith and show your principles by your deeds. Prove that you believe that you are only the servants of the Lord. Prove that from the earthly possessions, of which the Lord has made you the administrators you will give as much as you can for the Lord, and that includes your support of parochial education. Therefore to arms, men, women, and children, who have allied together under the banner of the Cross, and prove that your interest in parochial education is as fervent as is that of the secular world toward public school education.\"",

                "In Chicago, the saloons have side entrances which are convenient to the toilets. In the Netherlands, however, one finds only urinals, to serve the public. If you do find a comfort station, which is an exception, you pay for the use of it. So I come to the conclusion that the toilet situation in America is better than in Holland. I doubt whether erecting a sufficient number of comfort stations would prove Mr. Bolt's theory that there would be fewer drinkers. Closing the saloons or houses of prostitution does not remove evil. People of little breeding have evil passions and are looking for each others company either in saloons or in other public places. People whose desires are normal, seldom frequent saloons.",

                "The word \"prohibition\" is of the same meaning in the Dutch language as in the English. Although the meaning remains the same, it seems to be altered to the extent that in daily life it is only used exclusively in relation to the sale and use of alcoholic liquors. However this may be to the supporters of personal liberty who lament over the enactment of the prohibition law which curtails their personal liberty(?), prohibition will also be enforced against narcotics and all forms of dope. The so-called Miller anti-narcotic bill was accepted by Congress in Washington and it was up to President Harding to make this much-discussed subject a law.",
                "Those who are against opium prohibition have time and again declared that such a law was inadvisable, and would be impossible to enforce, pointing to the yet many cases of drunkenness in spite of the prohibition law. But, in the first place, the violations of this law are steadily declining and in the second place, the fact that a law is being violated cannot make such a law undesirable. Besides it will be much easier for the authorities to enforce opium prohibition than liquor prohibition.",
                "The new law gives the entire opium trade, manufacture as well as import, into the hands of a committee consisting of three cabinet members. This commission is completely empowered to stop all unlawful trade in morphine, cocaine, and other narcotics. Violation of this law can be punished by a fine of $10,000 and a five year prison sentence. And this law was necessary. The use of opium has, especially since the enactment of the prohibition law, alarmingly increased and for thousands of men and women, old as well as young, worked bodily and spiritual loss. Where a person does not know how to protect himself bodily and spiritually, then it is the duty of the government to come between and to protect the people from possible condemnation in spite of themselves. The government is in the service of the nation and does this not for the protection of a single person, but of the entire nation as such.",
                "Honor to the present government which had the courage to enact the opium prohibition law, and if there be obstacles to the enforcement of a law, those obstacles can be overcome. This was proved by the Sunday closing law in Chicago. Just as did the mayor of Chicago, the government at Washington shall find that the strict enforcement of the prohibition law and of the opium prohibition law will have the support of the best part of its citizens."

Mayor Thompson, what do you care if the wet army calls you guilty of treason? Let it talk and stick to your principles. Now, on Monday morning many a man, who drank on Sunday and felt the effects on Monday, goes to work Monday morning fresh as a rose and fit. And what does it matter if the saloon-keeper says that Thompson killed his trade and took his living? That is only bluff. The saloon-keeper took the bread of the workman and his family and now that he cannot get it, he protests in the name of \"Liberty\". Be brave, Mayor Thompson and do not cater to the saloons.

On the other hand, others criticize the smokers and point out that other fare-paying people have as much right to these seats as the smokers.",

But the nasty and ill-bred manner in which some gentlemen blow their smoke in the faces of other passengers, deserves everyone's disapproval and demands a severe reproof. Not only the last three benches, but sometimes all the seats of the open cars, are occupied by smokers. Closed cars' platforms are always taken by men who smoke, so that when a passenger opens the door to leave the car he has to cross through a cloud of smoke. The public ought to protest against this.",

Let us say, here and now, that we would strongly favor the closing of the saloons on Sunday. The possibility of this is another question. Then Mayor Dunne was a candidate for Mayor, he was requested by a committee from the \"Women's Christian Temperance Union\" and representatives of other temperance societies to answer the question: That if he were elected Mayor of Chicago, whether or not he would force the saloonkeepers to keep their doors closed to the public on Sunday? The Nayoral Candidate answered that he was not ready to answer this question, but that he could assure them, the committees, that he would enforce the law as it was actually written.",
                "Dunne was elected, but the saloons stayed open to the great disappointment of the \"Women's Christian Temperance Union\". Some assert that the Mayor does not keep his word and does not enforce the law, and they even call this a wanton violation of the oath which he took when he was installed as Mayor of Chicago. There is, so they declare, a law which prohibits the keeping open of saloons on Sunday and this law is not enforced.",
                "This declaration is not without good grounds. Indeed there is such a law. Although old, it is not obsolete, but is so covered by political dust and filth that it is hard to find and can,positively not be seen by the naked eye. But the Mayor, and in his name also the Chief of Police, declare that they have nothing to do with the enforcement of this law. It is, so they declare, not a City ordinance, but a State law, which compels the closing on Sunday, and if the State law must be enforced, then they must go to the Governor with their request. The Governor is the man who must take care of that, says Mayor Dunne. The Governor is also deaf to the request. He declares that he was not chosen to act as a bailiff or a policeman. And so things continue. The saloons stay open. No one feels himself responsible enough to enforce the law, be it the Mayor, the Chief of Police, or even the Governor of the State of Illinois.",
                "Just one question in conclusion: Why do we have so many laws which are being construed as unenforceable? The Sunday Closing law as well as many others, was never enforced and will evidently remain a dead letter."

In this country, with the wide, unpeopled, stretches of territory, much vaster than our wildest dreams, we are already complaining that there is not room enough for our growing humanity. We are puzzling ourselves about the future of the generations to come. The Dutch have solved that problem. Instead of complaining of the scarcity of land and the over-abundance of people for the land, they have reclaimed land from the ocean, and have enabled the Dutch homes to increase, without creating misery, squalor and social distress in large centers. Holland is preeminently a country of homes, there being in that land, that which more than any other has, the element capable of solving the perplexity of our day, the social problem.

The best citizens of Holland have among them, the descendants of those that were persecuted in Spain.

                "When the powers of darkness threatened to deprive that brilliant man of the privilege of speech, it was again Holland which protected him, and while assassins lurked in the streets of Amsterdam, ready to cut short the career of this torch-bearer of light, it was under the kindly protection of the Dutch emblem, that he worked out his system of thought fundamental to modern scientific investigation. Holland resisting Spain, bodily and spiritually, spread the teachings of modern thought. She was the torch-bearer of light because this country was the first free home of the sciences. Nations of home builders are always in the van of those who are pioneers in civilization. Look at Dutch art. What is the great characteristic of it? The homely themes are lifted up to the heights of symbolic suggestion. It is not like Italian art, glorious in tints and colors, creating for the moment the overwhelming sense of the power of man who has breathed upon the canvas the symphonies of glorious hues; it is not like German art, deep and mystical; not like French art, often frivol us and light; it has a character of its own. It is the story of the Dutch home, the Dutch home as the cynosure of happiness, built on the realization of human obligation and reciprocal responsibilities. They say the Hollanders are phlegmatic; it is true. They are not mercurial. That is the secret of Holland's conservation, it springs from the home, it is the very condition of Dutch progress, of Dutch progress, of Dutch liberty and Dutch love for looking forward together towards greater emancipation. Mercurial nations toy with liberty; they flirt with freedom. The French worship liberty and fraternity on paper, the Americans talk largely of liberty. We carry fraternity and equality on our lips. And yet we become a nation of sheep, allowing the rogues and rascals to shear us without as much as a murmur. Things happen in America to which even the Turks in Constantinople would not submit. While professedly loving liberty, we are all engrossed in making our way in the world. The spirit of self sacrifice has gone out of us and we want to change every four weeks or four months, because perhaps \"change\" is not plentiful in our pocketbooks. Every four years we look for a new nostrum, such a nostrum as no druggist would carry in his drug store, a patent medicine he would refuse to handle. We are like children, spasmodically talking about politics, and then very eager that somebody else govern us, and then we complain if we have statesmen in Springfield (God save the name) who should not be in Springfield but in Joliet. And in Chicago we have such political manipulators as that immortal statesman, Hinky Dink, of the first ward, is master of.",
                "Do you suppose that in Holland, where there are Dutch homes, such things would be tolerated? No, the Dutchman is phlegmatic, and will stand much, but he does not flirt with liberty. He is married to liberty and he wants his wife, and he himself, to carry on this marriage with all the obligations and responsibilities, and therefore the Dutch cities are well governed and the government of the nation is a model one. It does not matter if we do have a queen as a figurehead of our government she is a permanent president.",
                "She has less power than our president in Washington. She cannot interfere with legislation. The will of the people is at once made effective. They do not elect a parliament there and allow eleven or twelve months to elapse before calling it together, but immediately convene after the general election; thus they can have a change whenever the people desire one. Holland is, in fact, a republic of constitutional government, creating rights for and exacting duties from each citizen. It is rather a phlegmatic conservatism, but under it the condition of the Dutch works better than does the mercurial system of our American nation. I believe that the backbone of the American nation has been the element that came over with the puritans. They were also phlegmatic. They got ahead because they could resist and would fight for their rights.",
                "Holland risked the very existence of its country when invaded by an enemy. They threatened to cut down the dykes rather than submit to the invader. That is heroic phlegmatism, but this heroic phlegmatism, has always been carried by the Dutch into the home and the nation. Another thing which the Dutch home illustrates is cleanliness. They do not merely say that cleanliness is next to Godliness. There is nothing more inspiring than the morning housecleaning in Holland, and perhaps you all have suffered before you escaped the wrath of the Dutch maid in making her house as clean as possible. In Philadelphia they have also a passion for water. The Dutch may perhaps object to taking his water inwardly and will not do it without a silent grumble. The Dutchman may take his gin by preference, but outwardly he applies water most liberally. What could be better for Chicago than to have a Dutch housecleaning? They built out into the ocean to make new land, but they are now of the opinion that mud in the street is real estate in the wrong place. Let us have a little Dutch in Chicago and clean up in this city and make our influence felt. I am proud to have been with you to-night. The flag I learned to love was your flag. My America adopted the colors of Holland.",
                "I thank you for your attention, and I hope my words have not bothered you too much. Mr. Lloyd left us because he was afraid he would lose his train. I am afraid I have lost the train of my thoughts.",

                "Fellow Members and Welcome Guest:-",
                "Perhaps I should preface my remarks tonight with an apology for the fact that there is a Holland Society of Chicago. For in that city on the banks of the river up which Hudson sailed some hundred years ago, there is another Holland Society. It has its annual meeting recently. We have all been sorry to learn from the New York newspapers that it was a surprise to some members of the Holland Society of that city to receive an invitation to the annual dinner of the Holland Society of Chicago. There were arching of eyebrows and the question arose,\" Who are those Porkopolis Dutchmen, and where did they come from?\" What business did they have on earth anyway? Those effete, degenerate sons of sturdy, noble Dutch sires questioned our right to exist. They accused us of trying to imitate them. They threw out hints that we were snide Dutchmen. Those Peter Stuyvesants of Greater New York or lesser Amsterdam who take cold when the Prince of Wales gets his feet wet, who say, \"Don't cher know,\" and put hyphens in their names. Those Wouter van Twillers, who smoke cigarettes, instead of good old Dutch pipes with long stems, who would faint if they sat down to Weineker beer and Edam cheese, want to know who these upstart Dutchmen of Chicago are! It was an act of unpardonable presumption for Chicago to take the World's Fair away from New York City. It was still more unpardonable for Chicago to make a magnificent success of it. In like manner, it was a piece of unwarranted impudence for Chicago to organize a Holland Society. New York had gone into the Holland business first. We don't blame New York for its priority in this sort of thing. It has the first chance. The Dutch hit that town before they hit ours. We know, to be sure, if that city had been started by the same kind of Dutchmen that we have in Chicago, they would have made a thundering better town of New York But that only makes our offense all the worse. It is presumption... It smells to heaven. Still all of you have read the Knickerbockers' History of New York ( and you were not worthy sons of the Zuider Zee if you haven't read it) know that the early Dutch settlers of the Island of Manhattan, however much they have been lacking in the ginger that the early Chicago Dutch possessed, were way ahead of their descendants who still inhabit that close corporation. Where was Father Knickerbocker at the Bardley Martin ball? He simply wasn't in it. Not a Knick. Here was the greatest event of its kind of the century, heralded by miles of newspaper laudation, and transpiring on the Dutchmen's native heath, yet what was there to remind us of him? Absolutely nothing. Not even as abbreviated a costume as made another Gotham function so notorious about the same time. If there had been as prominent a society event in Chicago, do you suppose it would have been a strictly Prairie Avenue and Lake Shore Drive affair? Not on your meerschaums! The Dutch would have had something to say about it, and the time-honored wooden shoes of our ancestors would have clumped merrily up and down on waxed floors. In case any New Amsterdammers from the neighborhood of Gowanis Bay may be in hearing, these remarks must be understood as being made in a Rip Van Winkle sense - they don't count. I am speaking in particular of the Gothamite Hollanders, who turned up their Fifth Avenue noses at the mention of the Chicago Society and made cold, unfeeling remarks about the presumption of those \"Jyes\" out there on \"Lyke\" Michigan. But imitation remains sincerest flattery in all times. Let me dismiss this pleasant little reference to our New York friends, who, after all, would be good fellows on all occasions if only given a little Chicago training, with the observation that, at this same annual meeting at which was discussed our right to exist, there was much solemn debate over the question of adopting a Society button, a point in the history of our organization that was successfully passed when it was a few weeks old, but the New York Dutchmen are wrangling over it yet. Fellow members of the Holland Society of Chicago, I bid you be of good cheer. The infant is out of swaddling clothes and looks with calm self-reliance into the future, seeing naught but the bright rainbow promise of hope. Gazing back at our completed year of existence, there is nothing to regret, and much to which we can point with pride. The first annual banquet set a pace for future functions that will certainly compel the committees having them in charge to put forth their best efforts to equal it. The excursion to Holland, Michigan, on two beautiful yachts, so generously placed at our disposal, was sweet solace to those compelled to endure the midsummer heat of the city. Our year book is an excellent record, handsomely printed, of the early history of the organization. Our membership is increasing, slowly but surely, just as we would like to have it. And, unlike the Holland Society of New York, we are not compelled to say, as did one of the speakers at their last banquet, we contrive to keep up our membership year after year.",
                "Our Board of Trustees has labored unceasingly to lay the foundation of the organization broad and deep. From the members, not in the directory have come words and deeds of cheer and encouragement that have upheld the hands of those who have been entrusted with the guidance of affairs. The inspiration of our first president, Mr. Ackerman, has become a glorious reality, as attested by this meeting tonight. We are growing as a Society and we have no debts, nor do we have any reason to fear that our treasurer will imitate a recent example and hypothecate on securities. We are face to face with the gravest problems, national, state, and municipal. Little need is there to point out that the times are, awry. But in and through it all, let us remember that the Dutch as a class have ever been good citizens, even in Chicago, though perhaps New Yorkers would not admit it. \"Corruption wins out not more than honesty,\" might well have come from the pen of a Dutchman. In clean government and clean cities are the cardinal principles of our Fatherland. There are no half-way Hollanders. They are either all good or thoroughly bad. Saving the presence of the ladies and our clerical guests, allow me to say that even the alliterative reference to the\" D--d Dutch\" you so often hear has in it that which bears me out, for the phrase is always uttered in tones of the highest admiration or redolent with emphatic contempt. I know that the good Dutchmen predominate in Chicago, however, and therefore can promise that the 25,000 Hollanders and descendants of Hollanders who have made this city their home is a wonderful leaven for the municipal lump and go a long way towards working out our political purification. Our mothercountry, which in 800 years has increased in area from 600 to 13,000 square miles, has taught the world what thrift and sturdy application can do. It has furnished the object lesson of the centuries. It makes us proud that we are descendants of Dutchmen, that we trace our lineage to the blood Royal. The misty traditions of the past come to us tonight mellowed and yellow with age. Schnaps mingles with sparkling champagne. Out of the silent centuries softly stealing come the spectral forms of Stuyvesant and his sturdy Burghers, of Hudson and his merry men, of the settlers of the Manhattan Island and the Mohawk, clad in quaint costumes. We feel their presence invisible at our board. It is the inspiration which has given life to the Holland Society of Chicago. It is the golden promise of its future. Fellow Dutchmen and guests, fill to the brim the measure of a common kinship. Let it strike with glad sound the golden cup of friendship. Let us unitedly pledge the memory of our illustrious ancestors. And now ladies and gentlemen , it gives me unusual pleasure to present to you the toastmaster of the evening. I say \"present\" advisedly, for he needs no introduction, especially for the ladies. Let me add, that if every member of this Society would give his time to increasing its numbers as unselfishly and pertinaciously, in season and out of season, as Vice-President Peter van Schaak, our next annual banquet would be held in the Coliseum. Even then, I would have serious doubts as to the capacity of that building to accomodate all the members. To Mr. van Schaak has been assigned the pleasant duty of introducing the gentlemen who have honored us with their presence tonight, and who are filled with a wealth of oratory which but awaits the application of the corkscrew of opportunity to sparkle and effervesce before you. Let the doors be locked, so that none may escape. Mr. van Schaak, you are in charge."

He wants the most common laborer to receive a living wage; that there shall be steady work for every member of the Organization and a working adoption of the Golden Bule in all relations between employer and employee.",

Many who continue according to old methods may keep it up for sometime longer, but the optomist is certain that the Eagan method will be the most successful in time. \"Corporations have no soul, but even if this company has no soul, it shows that it possesses a heart,\" says the Pittsburgh Post. And the Christian Science Monitor adds this: that this method shall afterwards be recognized as the only, best and most profitable. The Golden Rule shall be known as a safe guide in all dealings with our people. To obtain a lasting peace between capital and labor, the question of hours and wages, must be solved in a Christian manner by both sides. Mistrust and money madness must make way for right, regardless of the consequences.",

A motion to deal with this program point by point was made and accepted with the result that after short discussions, the entire program as it was formulated by the committee was accepted by a unanimous vote. (The platform is on page 8 of this number). \"This,\" said the leader of the meeting, \"becomes the basis of the organization.\" A motion to accept this program as a basis for organizing was made and accepted. Then the business of organizing was taken up. Forty -five persons were immediately enrolled as members. A vote was taken and it was decided that the committee on preparations shall constitute the controlling body.

                "Our new Primary - Law viewed from the side of the politicians is a complete success; from the side of the voters a failure, notwithstanding the fact that most of our large American dailies praise its good qualities and advertise its good points far and near. It is a failure from the side of the voters, in the first place, because they are compelled to state at the polling place to which party you belong. The independent voter, who only takes the ability and fitness of the candidate into consideration, without asking which party he belongs to is eliminated. This should be changed my writing the names of all the candidates on one ballot. In the second place we call it a failure, because in most cases it does not bind the Convention to stick by a candidate, for whom the voters cast the majority of their votes. How crippled the law is in this respect is proven by the fact, that the politicians of both parties had to make up the lists of the candidates, who were to be supported at the convention, at their caucuses, after the primaries. It is still the same meddling as ever; not the voters, but a few political bosses, decide who shall have the nomination for this or that position. And that is the reason we said, that from the side of the politicians it is a success, but from the side of the voters a failure. It is hoped that this will be discovered and as quickly as possible the necessary changes and improvements be made."

The majority would have been much larger if thousands of Democrats had not voted for Mr. Yates instead of voting for their own candidates.",

Among them we must mention John J. Healy, candidate for State's attorney, and our compatriot G. L. Rries, candidate for county commissioner. The loss of Mr. Healy is especially to be regretted because his opponent John E. W. Wayman, who was nominated has declared positively that he will not attempt to enforce the Sunday closing law, which Mr. Healy in recent years tried to enforce, although his efforts were rewarded with little success.",

Kries, a man well known to our readers. He is a man who has lived among us for years, and has never been ashamed of being a Hollander; instead he has always regarded it as an honor to be one of a people who once fought for the civil and social freedom of the Middle Ages, and who are still known as the most liberty-loving people on the face of the earth.",

                "Mr. Kries was born in Allegan, Michigan, in 1859, and came to Chicago with his parents when he was a child. Mr. Kries belongs to a famous Dutch family of which every Hollander can be proud. His uncle, A. C. Tris, who came from the Netherlands in 1851, and spent his life doing missionary work among the Jews in New York, was known by practically every Dutchman in America and was respected by all.",
                "In his youth Garritt Kries was trained as a printer, but he was forced to give up this work because of his health. He opened a grocery store and market at 477 Western Avenue, and has been successfully operating that business since 1892.",
                "His ability as a politician is demonstrated by the fact that for several years he has been the acknowledged leader of the Republican party in the Thirteenth Ward, and one of the most esteemed politicians of the West Side. He has been asked many times to become a candidate for alderman, but although grateful for the honor he has always declined it.",
                "This time, however, he has heeded the insistence of his many friends and has agreed to become a candidate for the office of County Commissioner, mainly because this office administers the public charities, and the interests of the poor, sick and helpless of the county. Mr. Kries knows of no more satisfactory duty than that of keeping the interests of unfortunate people at heart.",
                "He reared and educated three of his nieces, and has provided a nephew with an education which has enabled him to move in the best social circles. This is an indication that, although he has no children of his own, he is deeply concerned with the welfare of others.",

To strengthen our contention we offer a letter that Mr. George E. Cole, for years president of the Legislative Voters League, wrote Mr. Ton a short while ago:",

He is also a member of the celebrated Chicago Charter Commission. He was one of the three organizers of the so-called \"Board of Hope,\" which was directly responsible for the passage of the new primary law. To Mr. Ton is due the adoption of the law that put an end to the deceptive practices of the private employment agencies. He was also instrumental in the passage of the bill to abolish white slavery.",

                "Therefore, we must insist that our countrymen of the Thirteenth District do everything possible to promote Mr. Ton's candidacy. We urge this, not because we are afraid that his opponent is more powerful, but because the election of Mr. Ton will lead to the obliteration of the saloon element.",

The Allies promise to aid one another in time of need, or, at least, in case one or the other gets into trouble with another country, to observe strict neutrality. An accord between two or three nations means more than mere sentimentality...Great Britian's purpose is mastery on the seas, expansion of the empire of world commerce, as well as leadership in the financial world. Japan's purpose in the first place is expansion. It already has gone to war three times for this purpose, with China, Russia and Germany; and everytime it came nearer to its goal. It won Korea, Formosa, Port Arthur, Saghalin, and economic control over Shantung, and military occupation of a large part of Siberia, as well as strategic points in the Pacific Ocean. And you know what Great Britian won. British friendship for the United States still consists in uttering words. With the strained relations existing between our land and Japan, we should consider very carefully what a renewal of an accord between England and Japan can mean for us. Let us not be misled by England's soft whistling. Beware."

At least not as far as actual disarmament is concerned. In the first place, because of the ever growing hate and jealousy among the peoples, such a disarmament agreement constitutes nothing else than blinding one another. Officially they may agree to a certain extent but in another manner they will continue their war preparations. In the second place, armament as well as disarmament cannot be controlled.",

In a few hours they make the trip, dropping in flight heavy mail bags in the cities which they pass on their given route. But in those 5,000 mail carriers you have also a mighty weapon of war, one of the mightiest to be exact. Those same machines fly like a swarm of birds from off the coast at the coming enemy fleet and drop, instead of mail bags, bombs weighing a couple of thousand pounds each. And not a splinter of the fleet stays above water. So much for defense.",
                "Then you have a strong merchant marine. Steamships, who in time of peace spread the commerce of your land over the seven seas and at the same time train many experienced seamen. In war times these merchant ships take on board these bomb-laden mail carriers, and no enemy fleet is safe on sea or in harbor, and there is no enemy fortification or coast defense that is not blown up if the bombs are heavy enough. Last week such a means of warfare was tested. As a target the erstwhile mighty German warship, the Ostfriesland, was used. Bombs of 1,000 pounds T.N.T. were dropped on it. These bombs had some effect. Then bombs of 2,000 pounds were used. These bombs, which were used in the test, missed the ship and fell alongside but when they exploded had such power that through the enormous force of the water the strong steel walls of the warship were crushed as though they were paper cartons.",
                "Add to this that all factories such as typewriter, needle, mail, etc., in a short time can be transformed for the manufacture of the most accurate bombs; that T.N.T. can be made in numerous industries without detection; that deadly poison gas can be made in paint and whitelead factories, and you see that you may talk about disarmament and come to lovely mutual agreements but the conclusion does not mean a thing.",
                "Then they may agree to lessen the building of large warships, which they fear may be sunk at the first opportunity, and possibly we may get our money back a little sooner, but for the real disarmament there is very little hope. Now we hope that Uncle Sam will make 10,000 fast mail carriers, and that our merchant marine may grow in a like measure so that we may be armed when it is necessary.",

They were conquered by much smaller animals through the use of poison stingers. I have seen a calf being killed by a number of wasps. Let us hope that the U. S. A. will not be such a calf. Let us be armed and they will have respect for us. And let us not give the building of these airplanes into the hands of $1.00 a year men, who during the war have squandered nearly a billion dollars and have not produced a single good and useful machine.",

The most active ferment in what promises to be one of the great crises of history, the sentiments to which you in this society gave your applause at your last annual meeting - sentiments demanding liberty, justice and mercy for an oppressed people near us - have been making rapid progress in the twelve months that have passed since. A story is told of Thomas Huxley, the philosopher, rushing out of the British Museum in a tremendous hurry, jumping into a cab and telling the man to drive as quickly as he could.",

After he had been riding for some time an idea struck Mr. Huxley, and he said to the man, \"See here, do you know where you are going?\" \"No Sir,\" was the reply, \"but we are getting there very fast.\" Such seems to be largely our position. I don't think we know just where we are going, but we do know that we are getting there very fast. We hope that we can see, not far ahead of us, two more Republics in the world - a Republic born in Cuba, and the Republic of Spain, the Republic of Castelar, (Spanish statesman and author) awakened again from its sleep of twenty years. The struggle which seems to be now approaching a climax is the same old war which has existed for three hundred years, begun long ago by William of Orange - the war of democracy against despotism; the war of free inquiry against the inquisition; the war of argument against assassination. And the contestants are the same. On the one side are the men of liberty, and on the other the men of slavery, with this difference. Alva,the representative man of the old regime, was able to boast when he left Holland for the last time, that in six years he had put to death 18,000 Hollanders; but today the Spanish representative of Alva in Cuba, Weiler, ( I don't know how to pronounce his name, but I suggest that we give it the German pronunciation and call it Viler), leaves Cuba, guilty, as Consul General Lee tells us of the death in one year of 200,000 men, women, and children. There is enough Dutch blood in the United States to put an end to this thing. We want no war. God forbid that there should be war; but if we have not yet arrived at the point, as Tennyson says, when we can leave unsought all the points of war, and fuse the people into one; if we are still on the stage where, as the same poet says, \"The voice of any people is the sword that guards them, or the sword that beats them down,\" let us meet the issue as brave men and honest lovers of liberty that we have inherited from William of Orange, Washington and Lincoln. We want no Spanish money; we want no Spanish soil; but I mistake the American people, if this issue comes to a climax, if they are at peace again until the American flag has been run up once more upon the sacred spot where the dust of the marturs of the Maine lies abandoned in the desecrating mud of the Harbor of Havana. We want no Spanish money, but if we are forced against our will to avenge this intolerable wrong by war, then we shall not end it until the real castles in Spain pay every cent of the bill of indemnity, down to the last farthing. And if Spain and her allies and the adherents of peace ask why we have not used measures of conciliation and arbitration, we can not do better than answer, perhaps, in the words of a story that I heard the other day. A man, carrying a pitch-fork, who had been attacked by a bulldog, ran the dog through. The owner coming up in a great rage, said,\"Why didn't you defend yourself with the other end of the pitch-fork?\" \"Why didn't your dog,\" said the man, \"come at me with the other end!\".............",

One of these items is the influence of women. The best intructress is better than the best instructor and the worst instructress is much better than the worst instructor. The world must be made milder and purer and must receive a clearer insight. That is the reason why I am in favor of music in the public schools--but only the proper music.",

Even the money system of the world is only a play. In a short time, you will discover that wars have their beginning in the banks. Let the money powers be shaken and a revolution will follow. The people will not tolerate the irregularity of clearing house certificates and false value standards. I am for genuine democracy! Woman's hope is in the public school--and the child and the student of a State's university must, in the first place, view such institutions as their own; secondly, they must invest in it (sic.) as much as possible and thirdly they should get out of it as much as can be gotten.\"",

Some of them have prospered to such an extent that they now possess large greenhouses and hot-beds, but most of them have still only a small existence. I am thinking of the celery farmers and truck farmers around our large cities in the midwest. This, that I read, could open to them prosperity in a big way. Certainly we must be thankful for our daily bread, but it is also our duty to look for advancement. Here is what I read and recommend:",

The highest court in the United States, by a recent ruling, has upheld these laws, with the consequence that about 30,000 Japanese are preparing to leave about 500,000 acres of California land. The Japanese must sell under pressure of the state. The land consists for a large part of small, prosperous truck farms of between twenty and forty acres. These farms produced seventy-three million dollars per year.",
                "The issue was fought for twenty-six years and now, through the decision of the Supreme Court, the fight is ended with the victory over the Japanese for the State of California. Some in California wonder whether the victory of the State is not too large and ask with fear, what is to become of these farms if the Japanese leave them in such large numbers? And how will the State carry the loss of Seventy-three millions?",
                "The Japanese are going to other states where such laws do not exist, to the East and to western states, such as Oregon, Washington etc. The newspapers in California say that there are no whites in California to take the place of the yellow race, and that thousands must be imported from elsewhere. And now I come to the question:",

                "If ever a movement could be called nationalistic, then we may say that this movement is a Dutch national movement which is being acclaimed with hearty sympathy everywhere in the world where the Dutch live. And yet everyone who knows our Dutch people, divided as it always has been into different parties and groups, with aims continually in conflict with one another, wonders whether a movement could ever be started, no matter how nationalistic in scope, which did not have obstacles in its way. There are always a few who are leaders in their own circles, and in defense of their groups they always have in view their own groups' welfare and the real or imaginary faults of other groups, so that they regard doubtfully in advance anything that does not originate in their own circles and is not meant for them. If they see anything come up which in itself looks inviting, then they naturally ask: Why is that not meant for us? So a certain Mr. S., a professor in Hope College, in an article in De Hope, sent to me with the request to answer it, asked: Why do they not seek to establish a chair of Dutch history, language, and literature at Hope College? The objections brought forward by Mr. S. in the article against the establishment of the chair at the University of Chicago I will gladly discuss, especially since this was the only article that sounded a sour note in this widely extended and general movement. I regret that this article came from Hope College, a school so long favorably regarded both in America and in the Netherlands.",
                "This [article], however, does not in the least influence the sympathy for this movement, for against this one Professor S. stand no less than five other professors and the President of the United States, who signed the petition to the University of Chicago. But it causes me pain that from the institution of Van Raalte, who with his colony left the old Fatherland and braved all hardships and sufferings to escape party persecution, now after only half a century should come the voice of partisanship, and that [this college] should close its eyes to the national cause for which all the scions of the Dutch race could work together. It is painful to hear from such a place the age-old exclamation: Why not give these donations to our institution? Why not establish that chair in our college? That Mr. S. is on the wrong track is readily seen when he refers to the writings of Dr. Kuiper and seeks his support in them, whereas Dr. Kuiper himself, as was manifested by the letter which we published, conclusively declares himself in favor of the movement.",
                "We do not doubt in the least the good intentions of Mr. S., but we may take it that he evidently has misunderstood the writings of Dr. Kuiper or has drawn from them the wrong conclusions, conclusions opposed to Dr. Kuiper's personal convictions. This is all the more evident because Professor Barinck, who also firmly adheres to Calvinistic principles, proves to be in full accord with Dr. Kuiper and with the entire movement. Ignorance of American conditions, especially of the University of Chicago, cannot be charged against Dr. Kuiper and Professor Bavinck. They are conscious of what they do and write. Both have been in the United States, have delivered Stone lectures, and know the University of Chicago better than many others. But let us discuss one by one the objections of Mr. S. His first objection is that the teaching of Dutch history and literature at the University of Chicago could not be done \"to the glory of God,\" although the Scriptures demand of us that we shall do everything to the glory of God. Let us see how true this is.",
                "The University of Chicago is a gigantic institution, with a teaching staff numbering between 300 and 400. That is no small community to be controlled by only a few persons. Most of the professors know only a small number of their colleagues. The various departments hardly concern themselves with one another. Men of all principles function there, for the most part independent of one another. The names of modern men such as Foster and Mathews, which are used by Mr. S. as scarecrows, have therefore nothing to do with the teaching of Dutch history and Dutch grammar. I have now associated for six months with the men of the University and have never had the pleasure of meeting or of hearing Professors Foster and Mathews. Therefore, I conjecture that the men who teach theology at Hope College are immeasurably more in danger of falling under the influence of those professors than the man who will teach Dutch history in Chicago. The department of history in Chicago teaches nothing but history; it has nothing to do with theology or philosophy; its teachers associate with one another and appreciate one another according to the knowledge of history which they have. Should you think that if some one was appointed to teach Dutch history and had all the sources for that work at his disposal and was master of his field, just as others are, each in his own field, any one in the world would make remarks about the teaching of our history according to the method of Groen or of Fruin, both great historians, who so wonderfully agreed on the most important points? Then why could not the instruction in our history be really historic as well as in accordance with our principles regardless of the institution in which it is taught? Whether a thing is done to the glory of God or not depends on whether it complies with the ordinances which God has instituted for it. And what other demand could Mr. S. make for the teaching of Dutch history then that it be faithfully examined for truth and taught as Groen the Calvinist and Fruin the liberal both understood it? Regarded objectively, the University of Chicago has no scruples against the teaching of Dutch history and literature, and subjectively it depends entirely on him who is called to this task. This automatically brings us to the second objection of Mr. S., namely, that a professor in Dutch history and grammar at Chicago would be doomed to be a biased teacher. Yes, still more. Professor S., further says:",

                "These words of Mr. S. are an insult to the University of Chicago as well as to me personally; they are at war with the truth and with brotherly love, against which, according to the Apostle, [one may not offend with impunity] (Romans 14, 4).",
                "I have personally listened in the University to men with different aims, among whom are the best orthodox speakers of the Baptist, Episcopal, and Presbyterian Churches, without ever discovering a trace of prejudice. Frankly and sincerely they proclaimed in the great auditorium of Mandel Hall their convictions, and again and again I saw the complete freedom of thought which was also accorded to men of Calvinistic principles. That the evolutionists shall speak freely, and men such as Foster and Mathews shall enjoy the same right and make use of it, is permitted not only in the University of Chicago but even in most of the churches of America, among them the Presbyterian churches also; is that any reason why Mr. S. should condemn their ablest leaders as biased teachers? It appears to me that Mr. S. has formed an opinion which is out of line with the truth about this great institution, the University of Chicago, in all its functions, just as some simple Calvinists asserted that Philip II., like Herod, was consumed by worms, and as some simple Catholics said of Calvin, his opponent, exactly the same thing, without knowing that such stories are not founded on the truth.",
                "Condemnation and prejudice have never occurred to me, and in the teaching of Dutch history and literature they are entirely out of place. Such teaching entirely depends on the measure with which the teacher himself is provided with material--whether he has the necessary sources at his disposal, and whether he is able to make known the incontrovertible results of the best investigations, against which no one in the University will have any objections. Now is it not lightly judged and at the same time in opposition to brotherly love when Mr. S. mentions me personally and declares that I, as teacher of Dutch history and literature in the University of Chicago, will be as a mouse in a strange warehouse? Has he the right to judge thus when I am unknown to him, while men like Dr. Kuiper and Professor Bavinck, in whose shadow, according to his own statement, he would like to stand, and who have known me for the last twenty years, express themselves so entirely differently? Not only the teaching of Dutch history and literature but also the writing of articles must be to the glory of God; therefore it should be done according to God's ordinances and not flippantly. All to the Glory of God and for the magnifying of His Holy Name! What a beautiful and holy principle! May every Christian write it on the tables of his heart and through it be built up in the holiest belief! But that selfsame holy principle is abused when it is used as a weapon to mow down everything outside the vision of one's small circle, and when one adds: If you want to do anything worth while, then you must undertake it in our circle. This might appear to be a Calvinistic principle, but indeed it is not.",
                "Apply this holy principle, for instance, to your own life, to your eating, your drinking, to your conversation, to your speaking and writing; then do you not come to the conclusion that measured according to this rule, the holiest things in this life have yet a preceding principle, that of obedience? And does it not cause you to say, if things are well with you: 0 God, have mercy upon my soul! It is so easy to misuse this holy principle flippantly and with it to break down everything because there is so little in this present life which can bear up under temptation. With it you can bring numerous people into discredit, every one, in fact, who must work among those of other opinions, be it in politics, in the community, in the missions, or in the [public] service as ambassador or consul; and likewise in the labors through which our national history must come to take its rightful place in the great center of the American population you may in this way flippantly enough try to estrange the hearts of our Christian people from all these things and say that in your circle, in your school, in your church, in your immediate vicinity this evil demand is being satisfied, and then it would appear to be Calvinistic, but the Calvinists have ever done just the opposite. In their own circles they were strict with the critic of God's Holy Word. They came together to confess their transgressions, to hear revival sermons, and to humble themselves before their God. And for those who were called to work in foreign circles and in foreign lands they were full of love; they remembered them in their prayers before God and strongly supported them with all the means at their command; and assured of that support and sympathy, [these workers] went their way among all people, over all seas, into all lands, and there gave testimony, as wise men who knew the time and its ways. Thus was the knowledge of Calvinism and of the deeds which God had done among our people made known in all lands, and His Name was honored. And so it should be now."

                "Only a few days ago the request came to me from the Holland Society of Chicago that if it were possible I might devote my time and my labor to the movement to establish a Chair of Dutch language, history, and literature at the University of Chicago. This task, regardless of the honor connected with it, I pronounced, so far as I personally was concerned, a delicate task, and against my undertaking it I mentioned three obstacles. In the first place, I am unknown to the Dutch in America, and this fact might easily damage the movement; in the second place, I have been repeatedly mentioned in connection with the movement, and it would appear that I was working in the case for personal profit; and in the third place, I know the condition of the Dutch in America and their inclinations only in part, and I did not know how to lead the movement to a successful conclusion. These three main obstacles, however, were overcome by the members of the Holland Society of Chicago. In their opinion I was the right man, and they would provide the necessary means to introduce me personally; they would provide all the documents pertaining to the history of the movement; and last but not least, the Holland Society had decided to guarantee a fund of a thousand dollars, half the amount necessary for the success of the cause, and at the same time they pointed out to me the way to procure the other thousand. I was informed that inasmuch as my name was connected with the matter, it would be genuinely American for me to put my hand to the plow. Never was a university, a school, or a church established unless those men who were most interested made a supreme effort. Thus checkmated, I could hardly withdraw, and since I could see the general interest in the matter, an interest shared by many men of reputation and influence, I had reason for joy and thanks that the Holland Society had such confidence in me as to make me its advocate and counselor.",
                "In the first place I had to introduce myself, and for me that was a delicate matter. I felt somewhat as Beets did when he wrote that chapter in the Camera Obscura in which he himself played the main role, which was the reason why he was embarrassed. But the Holland Society came willingly to my aid. One of the members had without my knowledge written to the Netherlands and requested references regarding me. As a result of this the following letters were handed to me with the request to make them known to the Dutch in America as my introduction. The first letter is from Dr. A. Kuiper and reads as follows:",
                "Dear Sir:",
                "Glad to see your handwriting, and I venture to state that Mr. De Vries is a very clever man, of keen understanding, thoroughly acquainted with Dutch history and with the Dutch language. I do not see how you could find a better teacher, and I shall be very [glad] if you succeed in giving him a Chair in Chicago.",
                "Yours very truly,",
                "Dr. A. Kuiper.",
                "The second letter is from Professor H. Bavinck and reads:",
                "Amsterdam, October 28, 1910.",
                "Dear Sir and Friend:",
                "It gave me great pleasure to receive a letter from you and to note that you are in good health, and I was no less happy to read that Mr. T. De Vries may obtain a Chair of Dutch history at the University of Chicago. I hope that the money will be collected, and that a Chair will be established in Chicago for the history of our people. That would be of the greatest consequence for the Dutch settlements, and Holland's name would be honored still more in America than it already is. And Mr. De Vries, when placed in this Chair, would speedily prove that he was the right man there. He has studied much about our past and has lived with us in the present. In addition, he is a man of strong convictions, who recalls to our people with spirit their glorious past, and he is thus, through his spirit and his character, more easily understood. Therefore may God bless your efforts. With hearty greetings from Mrs. Bavinck and me,",
                "Yours truly,",
                "H. Bavinck.",
                "The third letter is from the well-known Professor Blok of Leyden:",
                "Leyden, December 15, 1910.",
                "Dear Sir:",
                "I have the pleasure to testify that I know Mr. T. De Vries as a very clever man who from his youth has had a remarkable fondness for historical reading and research, buying and reading books and manuscripts and composing useful bibliographies and histories; expecially [valuable] are his biographical notes on the Dutch statesman and Calvinist Groen of Prinsteren.",
                "P. J. Blok.",
                "These are the letters which the Holland Society requested me to publish. When I arrived in America to pay a visit to my son, I had the pleasure of seeing consecutively Princeton University, the City of Philadelphia, the Library at Washington, the University of New York, Yale, Harvard, and Cornell Universities, the University of Chicago, and that at Madison, Wisconsin, I gained the acquaintance of a multitude of prominent professors and the welcome accorded to me everywhere made my stay in the New World exceedingly pleasant. Many times, in Holland, I had heard of the hospitality of the Americans, and when I was ready to make a tour of America, the question arose in my mind: What can I do in return when I am hospitably received? I decided to take pictures of historic and geographic interest illustrating all the provinces historic and geographic of the Netherlands, and from them I had lantern slides made so that if desired, I might give lectures on Holland. So I arrived in New York with 350 slides in my possession and found a hearty welcome awaiting me, extended by the members of the Holland Society. A few weeks later I gave a lecture, at the request of the Holland Society, before its members, and I had the pleasure of spending a happy evening there. Later, when I arrived in Chicago, I had the pleasure of giving a lecture on Holland with lantern slides before the Holland Society in the Stratford Hotel, and I had an opportunity to acquaint myself with many members, whose warm friendship I have enjoyed ever since. And it was here in Chicago that my attention was drawn to the movement for a Chair of Dutch history, language and literature, and in very high circles I was urged to hold myself in readiness for that position. To tell the truth, it had always been my plan to occupy a Chair of that sort at one of the universities, and I had planned my course of study with that object in view. But opportunity in the old fatherland is scarce; there is seldom an opening, and the old party war often plays the main role, so that sometimes one may wait his entire life before attaining his object, even though men of influence stand behind one with their recommendations. Yet what is hard to attain in little Holland would probably be easier in the greatness of America. Nearly all those who came from Europe to America have thought that they would try to attain there what they could not attain in the old country. And this same thought was with me under the influence of my many friends in Chicago. I would, however, not continue to hesitate what to do. If I wanted to settle here and do for my part whatever was possible to qualify myself to teach Dutch history and the Dutch language, then it would be absolutely necessary to bring a large part of my library, which I had gathered in the last twenty years to America, and that required time. I decided to take a chance with America and Americans, acquired my first naturalization papers, returned to Holland, and brought over a large part of my library, which only a few weeks ago arrived in thirty-four boxes at my residence, 5429 Drexel Avenue, Chicago, and to me it is true enjoyment to see again all those acquaintances of the last four centuries around me, and to be able to spend a large part of my days and evenings with them."

                "That Mr. van Woerden's qualifications in the Medical world could not remain unobserved was to be expected. In the Netherlands, his ability as a chemist and his method of urinalysis drew the attention of the principal medical authorities. Even while still a boy, he proved that he had a natural talent for chemistry, and drew the attention of the celebrated chemist De Kruif, who at that time was established at his birthplace, Delft; from De Kruif he learned much in the sphere of urinalysis, meanwhile continuing his studies under the guidance of Dr. de Haan of Bleskensgraaf, who during his life was known not only in the Netherlands, but throughout Europe, for his great talents.",

                "In Chicago his services were requested by the Medical Specialty Company. Before he was accepted, however, he was submitted to a strict examination, which ended to the satisfaction of all concerned. This Company has offered him a salary of $5,000 per year. This is not only a sign that the company gives him its full confidence, but it shows also, when professionals offer him such a salary, that he indeed must have produced much in the field of urinalysis."

                "Last Wednesday evening for the third time in the last seven months, many Hollanders gathered in Orchestra Hall. Last fall it was Mr. Alt of the Netherlands, who was the attraction, and a few weeks ago the Luther film. Both these programs were very good, although the audience, was not wholly able or educated to be over-enthusiastic about them. With the program of last Wednesday evening it was very different. The popular Homer Rodeheaver was there, not to give a classic or historic program, but to give in a simple, informed way, his talents to a common audience. And was it interesting? Ask anyone who was present. As leader of Billy Sunday's musical services and as well as in phonograph records and by his singing over the radio, he is generally known. But to hear him sing, personally, to hear him speak, and to hear him play on his trombone, is certainly a delight. We'd like to have seen the Hall filled to capacity but there was plenty of space, unoccupied. Those who were not there missed something of which they could have had pleasant memories for days.",
                "All those present were appreciative as was evidenced by the silence which predominated during the different numbers, and the spirited applause, which followed each number. We do not have many such opportunities and that is why we advise everyone to make use of them whenever and wherever they present themselves. Mr. Rodeheaver was supported by his sister, Miss Vivian Tripp and Paul Beckwith. If we are not mistaken they are all busy with Evangelical work, and the holding of Gospel meetings at Aurora, where Billy Sunday is, at present, with his large tabernacle.",

The weather was favorable so a large crowd of Hollanders and Holland-Americans took advantage of the occasion. The attendance was estimated at more than 1,600 persons. As to the organ music and the singing-we loved it, and we owe Mr. Sunhouts and the \"League of Societies\" of the First Christian Reform Congregation, a word of thanks for the good which through their efforts was given to our race. That Mr. Alt is a master of the pipe organ is doubted by no one. But the fact that he gave us music for a large part of which at least, translated feelings that are alive in our people, and which bring out individuality, made it that much nicer. Our souls could be elevated with the music to Him to whose honor all things must be.",
                "Among the listeners were reporters from the large daily papers and, at least two of these appeared the next morning with a good report of the recital of the \"Dutch organist.\" There was very little criticism. Both papers bore witness to the ability of Mr. Alt, although they would compare him with American organists, due to the fact that he produced something entirely different from what is given to the American public, as a rule.",

What struck us in one of the reports was the mention that Mr. Alt's organ music had a classic character, instead of being born or composed by him. His own compositions were not left unnoticed, and made a very good impression.",
                "The entire program, judging by the hearty applause, was well appreciated. We end with the wish that the League, or any other society, will prepare for us a similar wholesome evening of pleasure and that the public may again respond in the same spirit."

The Hollanders have proved by strong unity in the great City of Chicago, that, together, they could promote something good. There happened what has never happened before, that the great Orchestra Hall was filled with Hollanders; that the consecrated music of the Huguenots, the music of our Dutch psalms, the music which was sung many times by martyrs on the fun ral pyre, was heard in the place where usually nothing but worldly tones are heard, that the words of our unequalled Dutch psalms resounded under the mighty arches of the large building. One of the big Chicago dailies wrote, \"Orchestra Hall seemed like a mighty Cathedral on that evening, with the consecrated music elevating the hearts.\" That is different from the \"jazz\" music of our time. Even the world pauses a while and listens. And we are glad that Mr. Alt, organist of the great Church of Bolsward, made such a good impression even on the master critics of the big Chicago dailies.",

The attendance was 1,600 persons. Total receipts were $1,346.25; total expense for hall rent, advertisements, commissions, etc. $697.50.

Let us spend a few delectable hours in pleasant surroundings, where Christian fellowship prevails. The larger the attendance, the greater encouragement for repetition.",

                "Question: In the daily newspapers we read much concerning the coming Hudson Celebrations, taking place during the week of September 25, to commemorate the discovery of the Hudson River in the year 1609. Although Henry Hudson was not Dutch by birth, he, nevertheless, was in the service of a Dutch firm, and so the undertaking was strictly a Dutch venture. In view of this, allow me to ask this question: What is being done by the Dutch in Chicago to commemorate that fact? Or are our people indifferent about this matter?",

It would have been glad to plan a large gathering in the Downtown district, be it in the Auditorium Building or some other well known hall where one or more famous speakers would appear, but it was a question of money or rather of lack of it. Such a meeting would have cost at least $1,000, and it is hard to find someone who is interested enough in the case to spend such a sum.",
                "Other plans were also considered, for example, a large gathering exclusively for Dutchmen. This would be possible with the co-operation of the churches or the different Dutch societies. But to do this, there must be co-operation, and that is usually non-existent among our people. But it is not yet too late. Possibly there is someone among those who read this who can tell us how to handle this problem."

Who ever looks upon the proud buildings and no less upon the proud people on Michigan Boulevard at Chicago, will not suspect at a first glimpse that here is a true center of Holland art and culture, but by further investigation it is revealed in its full glory. The Art Institute in the first place, where Netherland art is being shown and admired. On the southwest corner of the main building one may see the names of Rubens, Rembrandt, Van Dyck, Feniers, Hobbema, Ruijsdael, and other famous artists, while inside a great collection of Holland master-pieces of the afore mentioned and of yet later artists are hung on the walls.",
                "Not only is here represented the old school of Rembrandt and Rubens, but also the newer school of Joseph Israels, Mesday, and Maris as well as others. Also the more decorative art such as Delft porcelain and earthenware. But more, also the planning of the Art Institute was for the most part Dutch, because of the most well known and beloved teachers in the drawing and painting was a Netherlander, Mr. John H. Vander Poel, whose book, The Human Figure, can be bought in all bookstores, and today, Mr. Herman Rosse, a Netherlander, known master in the decorative art, is one of the most important teachers at the institute. Further north on Michigan Boulevard is the Chicago Public Library. For a long time the library has had many Holland books as well as some Netherland newspapers and periodicals. The books were badly aged and in a bad condition.",
                "Recently the library received an exceptionally good collection of Holland books from Martinus Nyhoff, of the Hague, out of which collection is delivered the best of the new Netherland culture: poetry novels, prose, history, travel stories, colonial culture, and so forth. The names of the writers are world famous, Couperus, Van Eden, Multatuli, Heyermans Borel, Buysse, Emants, Helene Swart, Schendel, de Meester, Ouerido, Sable Scharten, Antink, Streuvels, Kloos, de Clerg, Fruin, Derwey, and many others more or less known.",
                "It was a pleasure to the writer to see the flower of this literature and to recommend it, because the librarian, C. B. Roden, had asked for Dutch advice, and through the medium of the Consul General John Vennema, Mr. C. Grentzebach were enable to give this advice. If only there is no shortage of Dutch readers, then this new collection may bear much fruit. Also the John Grerar Library across from the Public Library, has an exceptional treasure of Dutch books, possibly a couple of thousand. These books are more on scientific terrain, economics, nature study, technical subjects, history and states archives, in which this library is exceptionally wealthy. For a Dutch student, this collection is invaluable. North of the river is the Newberry Library, which has also a good collection of Dutch history and theology, and in this it has for long excelled. Also there is a number of Netherland periodicals; and you are well treated there. To make the measure full, the University of Chicago has also a good many of Dutch study books, and Dutch knowledge ranks high there. The name of the new president is Ernest de Witt Burton, who favors the Netherlands even as his predecessor, Dr. Judson.",
                "Chicago has thus a generous supply of Dutch art, culture and knowledge, so may also the existence of a paper as Onze Toekomst be of much joy, as well as the youngest movement which has as its purpose to give to Queen Wilhelmina an Art Album. That the ignorant criticise this, does no honor to the Netherlander, for without the Netherlands and the House of Orange, world history would have taken a different course and a free and Protestant America would have been impossible. Whoever will not honor the Netherlands and her beloved Queen Wilhelmina in this 35 year reign jubilee, has very little conception of the origin from which he sprang or the spring from which he drank.",

                "The Dutch press is the soul of Dutch life in America, and of the soul, the editors are the strongest revelation. That is, Dutch Journalism in the United States has the mark of personal journalism and is governed by a few influential persons. These persons are usually Dutch by birth, of genuine Dutch principles and character, and have thus impressed upon the Dutch press a strong character with Dutch peculiarities. The Dutch press in America is divided into a church and a secular press. But the last also carries a religious character. Experience has taught that a neutral Dutch press among the Reformed Dutch in America has no chance for success. The Church press has its home in the State of Michigan where there exists the largest Dutch population. The Hope, and the Leader of the Reformed church are published in Holland, Mich., while De Wachter and the Banner are published in Grand Rapids, Mich., as well as Religion and Culture. Grand Rapid is the bulwark of the Christian Reformed Church. The contents as well as the form of the English printed publications look definitely American. The language, however, is secondary for their main purpose is the well-being of Churches and Institutions. The two main papers of the Church, DeWachter and De Hope have, like their English sisters, about the same contents, more or less dictated by different needs and circumstances. In some cases, the same articles appear, although translated, in both the English and Dutch papers. The influence of these papers is very large in their respective Church groups, for what is printed in De Wachter or De Hope is usually taken for granted. Not alone have these church organs great influence as such, but also as carriers of the Old Dutch Civilization and as users of the Dutch language. These papers reach nearly all the Netherlands population in the United States and give to this population a feeling of self-appreciation as well is maintained our spiritual heritage. Next to the afore-mentioned church papers, weeklies, and news papers such as De Grondwet at Holland. The Christian Journal at Grand Rapids and the Hollandsche Amerikaan at Kalamazoo, Mich. have a far-reaching influence. De Grondwet is the oldest Dutch newspaper in the United States and was established in 1860. (It has never denied its exceptional character as a newspaper.) Besides general news, these Michigan papers have columns for Netherland news, correspondence agricultural news, editorials, and other such contributions. De Hollandsche Amerikaan, which is published semi - weekly, and the Christian Journal are more local of character and circulation than is De Grondwet. In contrast to its English name, the Christian Journal contains in the main Dutch articles, and but little news. The Eastern part of the United States has two Dutch organs, Het Oosten (the East-tram) at Paterson, N. J., and Holland and Her Colonies, a monthly, Published by the Netherland Chamber of Commerce at New York, and the Netherlands American foundation, of which Mr. Edward W. Bok is the head and founder. The first paper contains much news, is a Christian paper and is circulated largely in the immediate vicinity. Holland and Her Colonies is a trade organ with the purpose of making the ties between the Netherlands and America stronger. It uses the English language. This periodical with its glorious photographic pictures and good articles of high calibre, is devoted to the commercial cultural interests of the two countires. This organ is supported by influential Americans of Old Netherlands origin. In Chicago, the second largest city in the United States, and the actual center of Dutch life in this country, there is circulated in addition to the weekly, Onze Toekomst, a Flemish weekly, The Gazetto of Moline.",
                "Originally a young people's organ, Onze Toekomst, in a quarter century, became the most important newspaper among the wetherlanders in America. Under the energetic leadership of the Present editor, this paper has spread and has become a great influence. The foreign news bears witness to its sharp-seeing eye, the Netherlands news is newer and more interesting than that in most other newspapers in this land. Thru its numerous advertisements, it has become independent and was even able to publish and extra page called \"Het Westen\" (The West) which is edited from Orange City, Iowa. The main contents of this issue is written in strong and sometimes illustrious Dutch, which is a sign of good taste. In Iowa, there are now three Dutch weekly papers, De Volksfriend (the People's Friend) of Orange City, The Pella Weekblad (Pella Weekly) at Pella and the Sioux Center Weekblad (Sioux Center Weekly) at Sioux Center. The first mentioned of these publications contains many articles and pious editorials as well as a far-reaching correspondence from the Western States, while the other two are more local in character and meaning and are possessed of the same local characteristics. In the different publications in the Dutch language in America, there is, however, revealed one tone, namely, the tone of love for the Netherlands and the House of Orange. In this love they have never strayed or failed, because the ties to the Netherlands Royalty and the love for the old fatherland were in their blood as well as in that of the writer.",

                "A Christian Reformed church young-men's society in Chicago have hired the large Orchestra Hall, in which it will present a moving picture about Martin Lather and his times, which is the period of the Reformation. The profits will be for the Chicago Christian High School. The leadership of this meeting is assigned to two ministers of the Christian Reformed Churches of Chicago. The Boy's Society, before it started on this venture, asked the advice of the consistory under whose control it stands. The consistory found no reason for objection. We do not speak about the purpose to which the money will be given, because that in itself would not justify the case, if the case were not right in itself. But the venture, in our opinion, should not be rejected. The Boys Society has sufficient guarantee that the pictures, which will be shown on the canvas, will be about Luther and other persons and events of that time, which are educational and proper. That is the first demand that may be attached to such a case. The second demand that the pictures be shown under Christian leadership and in a Christian atmosphere, is also complied with. The leadership is put under our men and the people attending are our own Christian people. Thus we may not place such a showing in the same category with the moving pictures, which are condemned by us all.",
                "In the worldly places they have mostly disorderly and crime building pictures, and they are being shown in a worldly atmosphere. But just because the world misuses God's creation, is no reason why the Church should let go of them. For then we should have to let go of all books, music, songs and all art. For example, what rotten filth there already is in our daily papers. But against this misuse of God's creation by the world God's people show the right use for it. And then it cannot be denied that, pictures whether they are slides or moving, are a gift of God to education. Every one of us has a picture Bible to explain that, which the word of God teaches. And so we have in City Mission, Jewish Mission or Foreign Mission, pictures, which we show to our people. We have also had in Chicago other moving pictures, for example the Christian Charity in Germany. Although there is no evidence against this case, a word of warning is in order, namely, that we know the difference and do not go over from one to the other. That we should not take such a moving picture as reason to go to other bad, worldly, moving pictures. The danger cannot be denied, that there are always young people, who cannot recognize the difference. Against this, earnest warning should be given. And another warning is, that we have not too many of those plays. A picture or slide may be in its place, but that is not the point. As men, Women, young men and young daughters, we must make progress through study and by investigation, in society and in the home. That must be the main object and not the pictures."

                "This is a fast age. An age in which good and evil influences abound. All of us are subject to either the former or the latter. Judging from appearances at the present time, evil influences or tendencies seem to have the upperhand. And among them, especially, the tendency to dispose of a number of things which in the past have made life richer and better. Included in this number marked for destruction are homelike pleasures, such as worth while conversation, discussion of serious topics, and quiet evenings at home devoted to books, relatives, and friends. What pleasures are better? What enjoyments are comparable to these?",
                "While attempting to destroy them our rapid age would provide fancy substitutes; instead of books, it suggests movies, instead of relatives and friends, cabarets. An unbiased observer, however, should be able to discover quite readily, that the value of the substitute can not be compared with that of the original.",
                "As an example, read a book, for instance, Dickens' David Copperfield, as you attentively peruse sentence after sentence, the magnificent tale unfolds, slowly and carefully, a faithful portrayal of life. You conceive ideas of little David, follow him along the path of his career, meet delightful Micawber and other friends, listen to their conversation and thus receive a stimulant, an aid to your imagination, besides learning lessons of great value. All of this is infused into your mind slowly, carefully, as it ought to be if you desire permanent, lasting impressions.",
                "Now substitute a movie, David Copperfield is thrown on the screen. The tale unfolds quickly through on-rushing pictures. A few captions to explain hurriedly what the pictures portray. No opportunity, or very little opportunity, for the cultivation of imagination. No listening to delightful conversation. No valuable lessons learned. At best a very hurried, rushing conception speedily blotted out. The moral seems to be: Retain the homelike pleasures of life, enjoy evenings at home devoted to books, relatives and friends. Seek no substitute. Keep away from the movies.",

                "It is not alone the thrill idols (as the moving pictures were titled recently by a sister newspaper) who are worshipped by the idol worshippers who attend the movies, but the persons who are being photographed, who pose for the plays, that are really the personifications of this new and general idol worship. Actors and actresses who play the main roles for the movies, the stars, receive unbelievably large salaries. They live as kings and queens and as such they are honored by the public. Charles Chaplin, an English-Jewish boy, raised at the footlights, has, by making faces and being funny, within a short time made a fortune in this country, and has won a place in the hearts of most of our school children. And not along in America, but also in Europe. Last year he made a trip to the Old Country. Nowhere could he go but the people awarmed around him to do him honor. Mary Pickford, the brightest of the film stars, a small bundle of humanity less than five feat in height, during a visit in Paris was carried on the people's shoulders and in all the capitals of Europe was hailed as \"Our Mary\" and her husband, her second, as \"Our Doug.\" All these and other celluloid stars, with hundreds of others in the making, live in a so-called colony at Hollywood, near Los Angeles, California.",
                "That, that was made public from Hollywood recently is all but good. As we said before, these people receive fabulous salaries. And they are strong legs, which can carry riches.",
                "Now as far as that goes, Hollywood houses a weak-legged battalion. Scandalous drinking, petting, parties, harem plays, eastern opium evenings and nights and all forms of scandal and vice take place there. Life as it is portrayed on the screen is to a large extent a reflection of what really takes place in Hollywood.",
                "You may have read of the party last Labor Day, which was held in one of the hotels, that culminated in a scandalous murder, in which the fat idiot, Arbuckle was involved and for which he is still held. You may also have read of the murder of one of the film directors, Taylor, a man with a shady past, some weeks ago. Free love reigns in Hollywood, which was proved by the letters of important film actresses, found in the room of the murdered man, addressed to him during his life.",
                "Most of these prayed-to idols were married and divorced once or oftener, but practice, almost without exception, the things of which they point out the danger to the public, on the films. Oh yes! The films must teach the public. This they do by portraying the forbidden fruit in all its splendor. Bad money makes crooked that which is straight. Also, in the film world, the saying is that money has all the sins. If one of the stars violates the law then money also covers this sin and no more is heard from it. The earlier mentioned Mary Pickford lives with her husband, Douglas Fairbanks, to whom she was married after having obtained an unlawful divorce from her former husband, Owen Moore, in a palace that is fit for a king; sunken and perfumed baths, hanging gardens, a swimming pool and a complete assortment of bathing costumes to accommodate a hundred guests, make life there somewhat bearable.",
                "The film industry is one of the most important in our country. It is very little less important than the automobile industry. The movie habit, that is, the regular attendance to the idol temples, is as habit forming as the use of opium or morphine, more general, and is no less damaging to spiritual and moral life.",
                "Naturally, sometimes they produce as bait a very innocent play to come in the good graces of the more scrupulous and conservative public. Race relations play a most important role in the moving pictures, be it sometimes in the more, and sometimes in the less-concealed form. The film producers protest their innocence by saying: \"The public wants it.\" But they themselves have created the bad taste of every decent person, not to say Christians, for these pictures.",
                "The film producers and distributors, fearful about the protest of a part of the public, are not disposed to lose this gold mine and have coaxed one of our cabinet members, with a salary of $150,000, out of the cabinet with the intent, as they say, to clean the movies. But not only that, the film producing millionairas, mostly Jews, realize how a man of political influence and prestige, like Will Hayes, can protect their industry against laws and enforcements which are unprofitable for them.",
                "A warning against the movies in their present state is in order, because many of our young boys and girls are regular patrons of the moves. The danger, dear reader, young and old, is greater than many of us realize. To sum it all up: The regular attendance of the movies is a detriment to home life. The company that one meets in the movies is not upbuilding for our youth, to say the least. No difference is made. Everyone is welcome - gamblers, robbers, and all other undesirables as well as honorable citizens who go to see the movies and to spend their money. The plays are not true to life and that which is true is only the sinful part. False emotions are awakened. When conscience is being worked upon and it cannot be satisfied, such is damaging to character. For example: Pity is awakened with an imaginative person possibly mistreated by the state; children neglected by irresponsible parents; a woman fooled by her husband or another man, and so forth. Too often they see such plays, that when in actual life a person comes in contact with such a case the feeling of pity is deadened to such an exteat that the offering of help or the seeking for lightening of suffering is left behind. The plays are so produced as to prod desire and in a sly way facilitate the unlawful accomplishment of those desires. (This is said plain enough, we think but it is necessary). The devalopment of the brain become dull rather than sharpened by the plays, so that earnest thinking and common reasoning become lost. The movies are based on gain in the first place. Large attendance brings the most money. To gain large attendance they have to know how to reach the public. And this, as the film producers have laarned, can best be done by giving plays which are right on the edge, or a little over. Gain - that's what it is for. With higher motives they can't be bothered. Much more of the shady side of this shady industry could be summed up. Let this, however, be enough to warn parents and children.",
                "Be on your guard, parents. The devil has one of his strongest bulwarks in the movies. You may condemn the dance hall and tolerate the movies for your children, but the movies approve of the dance hall and is there pictured so interesting that for many youths the longing to also go there is irresistible.",
                "We repeat once more that the discover of moving pictures and prodection is nice and may be put to good uge. But the movies as we know them nowadays we disapprove of in the strougest of terms. We condemn them with the dance hall and the saloon on the same line."

On January 1, 1911, there was $40,969.46 in the treasury; an increase of $1,924.70 since January 1, 1910. Of this sum, $40,881.00 was the required reserve, leaving a balance of $88.46.",

This proposal was accepted with the inclusion of two other amendments, which read that not only Dutchmen, but also Belgians by birth or descent can become members and that the children of members, who are not from Dutch descent, may also be accepted as members. Thus children, of other foreign nations, whose parents are members, may join but no others. A few other minor changes in the by-laws were made, but most of the proposals could not be discussed, because most of the members left immediately after the election. As a sufficient number of members did not remain to form a quorum no lawful decision could be made. A noticeable improvement over former years was the fact that there were four ballot boxes instead of one. The election was thus made easier, and the counting simplified.",

                "Since that time the matter has not been discussed. Last winter, at the general meeting, the people were so noisy that no particular subject could be discussed at length. A committee was appointed to revise the regulations, but it was evident that the people present did not know what was going on, and that this committee could do no more than bring in proposals for the revised bill. These proposals can be discussed only at the general meeting in February, 1909, and the revisions cannot be approved until they are voted on in a special meeting.",
                "In view of all this a special meeting is necessary to adjust the discrepancies of the meeting of May, 1907.",
                "The advisability of increasing the death payment was discussed some time ago; therefore we deem it unnecessary to review the arguments pro and con. We are of the opinion that an increase is necessary. It is best to decide this matter once and for all, so that no business is left undone or half finished.",
                "We suggest that the payment for adults be not less than one hundred and fifty dollars, and a proportionate amount for children. The present payment is much too small to be of real help to our people in case of death."

We are loath to imagine such a thing, but it cannot be denied that such a possibility exists. The well being of \"Zelf Hulp\" depends on the executives who handle the business in the right way, and a Board of Directors, which has the good of the society at heart and does not consider time and trouble too costly to give for the good of all. For this reason, whatever your plans may have been, let these words awaken you, not to stay at home, but by your presence show that you have the interest of the society at heart. Then vote for officers as well as directors; for men whom you know, that they may have the interest of the society and your interest at heart and apply it consciencitiously. The following items prove the increasing prosperity of the society, which makes further proof unnecessary. Death benefits paid: In 1880, $ 39.00; 1885, $622.00; 1890, $2,415.00; 1895, $5,362.50; 1900, $7,215.00; 1905, $8,720.00.

Since our last visit, one building has been completed and an entire new one added, which is a sign of expansion, but not enough expansion. The buildings are overcrowded in the basement. Some rooms were even built in the basement for patients, and the beds are too close together. But under the circumstances, it cannot be different. The administration is anxious to fill all application for space, but is unable to do so. Many applications have been turned back for lack of room, and the lack of room is a consequence of lack of money, and the stinginess of many of us towards this project. A visit to the hospital makes one feel again, what a large gift God has given us, in a healthy brain, and how awful it would be if one had to miss that. For that reason we are called upon to help these unfortunates as much as possible, and show them our charity. In this it is part of our calling as Christians to give to our nervous sufferes and the insane, Christian treatment. We noticed again how orderly and clean everything locked. That the treatment there is unsurpassed we found through one of our friends, A. Vogel, one of the nerve patients, with whom we spoke. Let us remember this institution in our prayers and donations."

De Jong gave a report on thirteen different denominations, which had been helpful in the work for this home. The ladies have gathered during the last six years $10, 471.36. The ladies of the church, where the gathering took place, had prepared a wonderful program and refreshments, of which good use was made. Mr. Tamminga, in short, pointed to the fact that the time was ripe to build a new home. Later we will hear more of this. The meeting was closed with prayer by Harry De Boer.",

There was a dialog of five ladies, a duet was sung and other entertainment was had. Mr. J. De Jong gave a report of our Tag Day. The Matron told the ladies what was brought into the Home in the last three months by friends and that some young people, surprised our aged with a visit to spend a pleasant evening. According to the By-Laws of the Circle, three ladies from each congregation had to resign after four years of service.",

The Tag Day, held on May 14 last, brought the sum of $2,415.11. To this we can add from friends $31.50, thus making a total of $2,444.61. We had more workers this year than the last four years, and it certainly paid. Each year we climbed higher, but this year we had $573 more than last year. A true word that many hands make easy work; and we thank all the ladies, young and old, and those who have sent in their gifts for this purpose. This month our Ladies Circle completed, of its existence, eight years.",

In the last meeting of the society Excelsior, a plan was brought forward to make efforts for the acquisition of a Home for the aged, for the benefit of our Dutch people. We all know that in Chicago are many aged Dutchmen who due to their old age are not capable of making their own living. So many are there who must apply to one or other charitable institutions and ask for assistance for their support. that they may spend their last days there. And very often the support of our aged by friends and relatives as a rule is short lived. And so you see, then the poor farm is their only refuge. And what that means only those who have experienced it know.",

The box which I took from Holland was not nearly enough, to give each girl wool enough to make one pair of stockings. I asked Capt. Jos. Pedlow, see of the American Red Cross, to permit him to become acquainted with the work of our society and to see if he could help us supply wool and knitting needles. Captain Pedlow testified: Miss Kuiper, your society is doing really splendid work and I will do whatever I can for you. And the well liked Captain Pedlow kept his word and opened for us the horn of plenty. Sixteen boxes containing 1,300 K. G. wool; 2,000 yards flannel; 100 cartons toothpaste; 1,000 comfort bags, which serve as work bags; 100 cartons of buttons and a large collection of binding.....We came to the conclusion that we had wool enough to knit a sweater and a pair of stockings for each child and enough flannel to make a dress or suit for each child. After that Pedlow made a tour of inspection, and signified his satisfaction saying: \"Well, Miss Kuiper, your children and mothers have really done the best they could. Do you know that these dresses are all so well made and show such good taste that in Wall Street, New York, they would be glad to sell them, and they would get a pretty high price for them, too..\"",

Evidently there are many who do not understand what a line of division Americanization in the home life creates, how it is possible that the parents do not understand their children nor the children their parents. But when we speak of the possibility that parents and children do not understand each other, then we mean that there is present such a difference of opinion that it forms a division line which works unprofitably for the oneness and harmony of homelife and was many times the cause of much suffering. The fact is that our children grow up as Americans. Born here, they have no idea about the land of their parents, often times a wrong idea. Their rearing outside the home brings them in contact with American ideas which form part of their early development. The atmosphere of the American life is their own.",

Is the natural love between parent and children cooled? No, at least not in every case.",
                "But there is a difference and that difference does not unite, but spearates. What is that difference? That the parents have held fast to the habits of the land of their birth; have declared themselves many times unsympathetic towards their children about the language and habits of the new land, and have tried so little to acquaint themselves with their new surroundings. The language was possibly felt to be the sharpest stumbling block. Many a parent has showed his animosity to his children and towards the language of the land, even giving orders not to use the language of the land in the home.",

                "As self-consciousness grows, this is felt: The child feels if he wants to express himself properly he must use the language of the land and you will always find they are using it wherever they go. The net result is that they are slowly but surely beginning to look down on the language and with the dialect too learn to hate the Holland language and with the language every thing Holland.",
                "This is too bad, but it is a natural result of the course that was followed. The writer has many times heard confessions of people born here and who made a trip to the Netherlands that they had an entirely wrong impression of Holland and from whom did they get that impression? From their parents... Americanization is a stream you can not turn, you can dam it for a time but the result is that the water goes over the levies and sometimes does much damage. The damage is already large enough... What must we do then? The answer is this, that we must start with Americanization in the home. Parents must understand that they must adjust themselves to the land, that their children are Americans who feel just as much love for their land and language as they did for their birthplace and language. Only then can their children take their place with honor and influence to do the most good if they are really brought up in the language which is theirs, in which they think and in which they live. All efforts against that are bound to result in disappointment. If we love our principles let us see that they are propagated here but that they will sink with us in the grave and that only can be done by sound Americanization.",

But, as it so often happens, there was nothing more heard about the affair. Later on the silence was broken again by Mr. S. E., who in the same manner wrote an article on this subject in Onze Toekomst, Since then however, nothing more was heard, and it seemed as if this matter had come to an end. This, however was not the case. For a long time people were working on the matter, and at present things have come to such a pass that they must be laid before the public.",

                "Friday evening, February 14th, all people interested are invited to come together in Soustek's Hall, at the corner of Laflin and 18th Streets, where all information can be obtained and definite precautions taken. However, I hope to give more definite information about the enterprise in another number of Onze Toekomst."

Instead of lowering the wage-standard, these hundreds of thousands of immigrants are giving more work to the people.",

The talk had a personal note, but the application made by the speaker was that the United States should always be prepared for any national emergency, and not be caught napping, as it was in the Spanish American War, when the nation desired to liberate Cuba and Porto Rico, but lacked even the most rudimentary elements of modern warfare.

Posthuma, vice consul of the Netherlands. The host was well satisfied with the attendance, because, as he said, of the twenty-two invited, twenty-three were present. Prof. E. D. Dimment, president of Hope College at Holland, Michigan was present as a guest of honor. Vice Consul Posthuma is thought to have found his number (23) because of the remarks he made after the speech of the guest of honor. After the partaking of the well selected food, the program of activities was handled in a most businesslike way. The new organization shall be known as the _________________________ Chicago Knickerbocker Society. The By-Laws, proposed by a committee, were adopted with few changes.",
                "The principles of the society are: The cultivation of mutual pleasure, the immortalization of the folklore, the keeping alive and propagation of the principles and qualities of the Dutch people. Further, the society hopes to give its support to Dutch art and other institutions in Chicago as, for example, the Holland Old People's Home, and so forth. Officers chosen were: President, Gelmer Vuiper; secretary-treasurer, D. J. H. Hospers; delegate-at-large, J. J. Van Pernis. In closing, a speech was made by Consul General John Vennema."

These eleven men knew what they wanted and their meeting and perseverance was the medium for organizing the society, Emm. In remembrance of this event, Emm held its 13th annual meeting on February 23rd. During its existence, it collected a small contribution of 10 cents per week, the society has accumulated a treasury amounting to over $1,500 at present. It has not only been able to acquire a treasury but has shown itself at all times to be helpful to the membership and also to those Hollanders who were not members and who proved their need. During the Boer war this society, was in the front in supporting the Boers financially in their great struggle with England. That Emm, during all that time has survived and has been successful, is not only proof that it is not composed of disreputable persons, but that it is founded upon good principles, and that the executives and the members know how to cooperate. On the occasion of its 13th anniversary Emm celebrated by having a feast in the beautiful Sibuse Hall on 12th Street last Saturday. This great auditorium was more than filled by the members and those generally interested. This feast was a great success, and the feast-committee has shown that they were fully able to carry out the task assigned to them.",
                "The orchestra consisted partly of members, and in a short while there is a p possibility that they will have their own orchestra. The feast was very successful and it was proven again that the beautiful saying \"Eendracht maakt macht\" is not just a hollow sound.",

Of this meeting you will find an announcement in this number of Onze Toekomst. We can add nothing to this except to state, that everyone who is interested in the well-being of our people, here and in the Netherlands and in all corners of the world, is energetically invited, not to let this opportunity pass by. Let us as Dutchmen support the well-being and prosperity of our people, especially where this is so closely connected with the wellbeing of this land, our newly accepted Fatherland. At this executive meeting it was also decided to establish a respectable Dutch library, the details to be worked out later. This work was started by a gift of $50.00, which was our division's share of a donation to the General Dutch League of $500.00, by H. M. Queen Wilhelmina, for the purpose to spend among the Netherlanders who live abroad, in this case those who live in Chicago. The library will be named \"The Queen Wilhelmina Library\", in her honor. The adminstration hesitated somewhat to make the above mentioned decision, not knowing whether the attendance would be sufficient to justify the establishment of such a library. We are happy nevertheless that this decision was made, because nothing else could serve better to teach our people Dutch grammar, knowledge and wisdom of all descriptions, as a respectable gathering of Dutch literature."

                "Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:",
                "To appear before you this evening to offer you the second annual report of our division, affords me much pleasure and I trust, it will be the same to you. If many had expected, that our division would have ceased to exist, that thought, luckily was not confirmed; just the opposite, according to all indications, it has come to stay. Compared to human life, our division has reached the age, in which one learns to walk. But you know, how the child at that time needs the aid of other.... Taken as a whole, the year 1906, for us, can be successful. The board has been able to convene regularly each month, and the minutes can prove to you, that not alone through faithful, attendance, but also through earnest consideration, it has indicated that it has the welfare of our division at heart. Two open, and two ordinary meetings were held in the past year. The first open meeting took place on April 17, in the First Christian Reformed Church 14th Street. The speaker for that evening was Rev. Broekstra of Englewood. He made a beautiful speech on the subject: \"lasting relationship with the Dutch race is necessary for those of Dutch descent in this country to be a blessing for the American people\".... The second open meeting was held on August 31 (Queens day) in the First Reformed Church on Hastings street. The President, then, gave us an historic resume of the house of Orange, and sketched for us the meaning of that day for the Dutch people and for us. The main speaker, Rev. Breen, after that, spoke on the topic: \"The influence of the Republic of the Netherlands on that of the United States of North America,\" The speaker said, in a way all his own, that, although language and grammar, make it look as though every thing here is inherited from England, this in truth is not the case, which is plainly shown by the following oppositions: in England, rule by the Aristocracy, here equality; in England, church ruled by the state, here division of Church and State; in England a difference in election, etc. etc. After that he pointed out, what an influence had gone out from the Netherlands, and reminded us of the Union of Utrecht, the stay of the Puritans in the Netherlands, etc, and ended with the assertion; that the union of the different peoples here, is fulfillment of the prophescy of the union of the people on earth.",
                "On the regular meeting, held on June 12, an interesting debate was delivered by Messrs. De Boer and Dr. Birkhof, the subject: \"We must maintain our distinctive nationality here, as long as possible;\" and on the regular meeting of October 30, a debate was also held between the Messrs. Holstein and Emmering on the Topic: \"A seat of learning for the Dutch language in our universities is necessary, so that we may know our American institutions.\" Added to this, there were held on the above mentioned meeting some recitations by the Messrs. Ottenhof. Holstein historic resume of the house of Orange, and sketched for us the meaning of that day for the Dutch people and for us. The main speaker, Rev. Breen, after that, spoke on the topic: \"The influence of the Republic of the Netherlands on that of the United States of North America,\" The speaker said, in a way all his own, that, although language and grammar, make it look as though every thing here is inherited from England, this in truth is not the case, which is plainly shown by the following oppositions: in England, rule by the Aristocracy, here equality; in England, church ruled by the state, here division of Church and State; in England a difference in election, etc. etc. After that he pointed out, what an influence had gone out from the Netherlands, and reminded us of the Union of Utrecht, the stay of the Puritans in the Netherlands, etc, and ended with the assertion; that the union of the different peoples here, is fulfillment of the prophescy of the union of the people on earth.",

Ottenhof, Holstein and Koelikamp. Through the medium of the executive board, we received a gift from Queen Wilhelmina of fifty Florins, which gave momentum to the establishment of a Wilhelmina - Library, for which the first shipment of books can be expected soon. Correspondence with the Dutch Chamber of Commerce at New York was had, with the view of organizing such a Chamber of Commerce in Chicago, but the Board considered it necessary not to go into such an undertaking for the present, on account of the many hardships connected with it. The correspondence with the executive Board has been regularly kept up and was always of a friendly nature. Lately there has also been correspondence with the Book committee. From the West - Indies we received an inquirey about conditions in the United States for the benefit of a very promising and brilliant young man. We also received a letter from Denver - Colorado, for information concerning a certain branch of trade, and from Asia fro information and help for the building of a factory for the manufacture of Cotton - seed oil. A report of the Chamber of Commerce of Smyrna was sent to us, and one from Haarlem of the Colonial Museum, which is located there. From the executive Board we receive monthly, propaganda numbers of Neerlandia. (Official publication of the General Dutch League). They also mailed us 25 pictures of H. M. Wilhelmina, which were gratis and 25 at our request, for the low price of 30 Dutch cents, a piece. Besides every member having received one, the picture also decorates the walls of the Theological School in Grand Rapids, the Theological Seminary at Holland, Mich., and the Christian and the Christian Schools 104th Street and Englewood. From this you will get an idea of some of the work we seek to accomplish. Our membership, which last year had mounted to 30, is now increased by 8, that would be a membership of 38, but during the past year 4 resigned and 2 were scratched by the Board. Thus the members in good standing actually count 32. The By - laws were amended so that the Board has control over the acceptance of all new members. In 1905 we were exempt from contributing to the general fund, but this year we did not take advantage of that privilege and sent our share to the executive Board. Even then the Treasurer's book closed with a net balance. From the outside we were treated royally. The use of the Churches was gratis and the singing school and men's choir served us gratis. Looking back on the year just passed, we have reasons to be thankful and that gives us courage to face the future hopefully. Naturally we have not yet reached our goal, but in the Division itself, signs of life are beginning to show, and if I am not mistaken, these signs are an assurance for the acquisition perfection.",

                "On Friday, March 4th the \"Young men's Society of the First Christian Reformed Church\"will present for your approval an eight reel motion picture entitled, \"Martin Luther, His Life and Time\". A most remarkable picture, showing in detail the life of the great reformer and the age in which he lived. Conditions in the Roman Church during the period of the Reformation are portrayed. The student, Martin Luther, finds the Bible in the library of the University of Erfurt, 1502. Martin Luther vowing to become a monk during a thunderstorm, July 2, 1505. The young monk Luther in the Augustinian Cloister at Erfurt, 1506. Luther's first view of the eternal city as he approached Rome, October, 1511. Luther, nailing the ninety-five thesis upon the door of the Castle Church at Wittenberg, October 31st, 1517. Disputation between Luther and Eck in Leipzig, July 5th, 1519. Luther before Emperor Charles V at the Diet of Worms, on the evening of April 18th, 1521. Luther preaches beneath a linden tree in the village of Mohra on the morning of May 4th, 1521. Luther's marriage with Catharina Von Bora on, June 13th, 1525. These and many other phases of Luthers life are portrayed. Truly this is a picture that must be seen to be appreciated. Don't fail to see it at Orchestra Hall, Friday, 8:15 P M....",
                "Endorsement of picture by Dr. Clarence Bouma. The committee received the following letter from Dr. Clarence Bouma dated February 2nd, 1927: \"Replying to your recent letter in which you request my endorsemnet, if possible, of your proposed plan to present the film entitled \"Martin Luther, his Life and Time\" under your own auspices, and for the benefit of the Chicago Christian High School, allow me to say the following. From my lecture on \"The Movies\" delivered on various occasions you may know, that I am the sworn foe of the corrupting influence exerted by the present - day moving picture theatre. The average moving picture theatre is, in my opinion, a positively demoralizing influence, and ought not to be patronized and supported by Christian people. The art of moto-photography, however, which the moving picture houses are using almost invariably, today for their corrupting and debasing purposes, is in itself an art which, under proper limitation and judicious control, can and ought to be used for the highest educational purposes. Any attempt to produce films, which are truly clean, educational and inspiring, and to present such films under proper auspices to the Christian public, ought to be welcomed and deserves our support. Now without a moment passing upon all its details, I consider the Luther film, produced under Christian auspices in Germany, a splendid help to our Christian public to cultivate love for, and appreciation of, the great work of God accomplished through the heroic reformer of Wittenberg. I heartily endorse your plan to present this film under your own auspices and am convinced you are in this way furnishing clean, instructive and inspiring entertainment to the Christian public, which ought with increased determination, to turn its back upon the present day moving picture theatre with its worldly, demoralizing influence.",

For each family, whom we visit, we write a card on which is written the name, age, and the nationality of the members, whether they are orthodox, modern, or unbelieving Jews, whether they own a Bible, and in which classes and meetings in our mission, the various members of the family participate. As soon as one of us comes in contact with a new family, a card for that family is written. To get acquainted with a new family we must have a medium. In our city, we find the doors to the homes of those not known to us mostly locked. Now the medium we often find in the children, who visit our classes.

In our minds, it is the most ideal last resting place for our dead. Mt. Auburn is ideally situated. The cemetery borders on West 41st Street and South Oak Park Avenue. It can easily be reached by automobile, over paved roads, or by the use of the elevated or surface lines. The route runs west to South Oak Park Avenue and then further along the yellow bus line of the Chicago and West-Town Railways Company, straight to the entrance to the cemetery.",

This booklet explained what bright prospects were in store for colonists of the type represented by the thrifty and hard-working people of Noord Brabant and Limburg especially. The result of his efforts was, that in March, 1848, he set out from Rotterdam with three shiploads of Catholic Hollanders. The vessels bore the names, \"Maria Magdalena, America, and Libera.\" All who accompied him settled in the Fox River Valley, a very fertile and beautiful area, but at that time an uncultivated and uncivilized, part of Wisconsin, between Lake Winnebago and Green Bay.",

                "It may be said that the Dutch Catholics, both at home and abroad, have at all times shown themselves strong advocates and champions of religious education in the schools; hence, in parishes where their number is insufficient to form a congregation of their own, they pledge their material and moral support to parochial institutions, irrespective of nationality, and they manifest appreciation of, as well as fidelity to the fate which their forefathers kept and cherished thru ages of oppression and other forms of adversity.",

It is important news, because such a work is not only large and expensive, but the issue of this book for the blind will be of great influence. Because of this latter fact, I wish that you had mentioned that this work for the blind can do them little or no good, but harm without end. For Hendrik Van Loon in his Story of Mankind is a blind leader. He is entirely a materialist and an evolutionist. He seeks the beginning of man, not in a deed of the creation of God, but--we know that theory--in slimy mud, out of which millions of years ago an animal appeared which became the father of all mankind. From this foolish theory, from which God is simply left out, no light can be expected that will make them see the light."

Although Pastor Van Hulst had not been strong recently, his death did not come as a result of sickness, but was due to an accident. He had arisen to light the gas in his room, but the effort had evidently taxed his strength to such an extent that he had to hold on to the gas cock which broke, and then he fell down unconscious. Another priest in an adjoining room detected the odor of gas, opened the door to Van Hulst's room and brought the unconscious old man outside. Although a physician was called immediately, and Father Van Hulst regained consciousness so that extreme unction could be administered to him, he died about an hour later.",

He worked for twenty years at the University of St. Louis, first as a professor, and later as director of the Home of the Good Shepherd, a charitable institution to which he dedicated his whole life, and which he continued to serve here in Chicago.

                "In order to grow, a society of young men or young women requires co-operation among its members; for a house divided against itself cannot exist. Thus the ideals and the purpose of a society must provide inspiration to all its members. Young men and women who share the same ideals organize a society in order to attain them. This aspiration is responsible for the existence of the reformed boys' and girls' societies. Such societies must necessarily devote themselves to the study of reformed principles. But what are the reformed principles? We can define them as \"The thoughts of our God, as revealed in His word.\" God's word teaches us the meaning of life and how we must always walk in His holy presence. Reformed principles give us thus an appraisal of life and of the world. Reformed principles must gain more and more ground, and for that reason they should be studied and examined. Guided by those principles our youth will be able to brave the storms of life. We are happy, therefore, to have in our midst a union of reformed boys' societies. I am glad to say a few words about that union. \"In union there is strength\" says an old Dutch proverb. The reformed families of this community have grasped the importance of this saying and have put it into practice in their own lives. The different societies have banded together in one union of young people, in order to face the difficulties of life together. Such a union, to be profitable, should have frequent meetings. In these meetings the principles common to all should be discussed.",

He in whom Christ is living must produce fruits. Boys and girls, live up to your vocation, be true to the covenant of your God, even amidst the temptations of life!"

The Sunday-School administration had called the members and their friends together to witness the jug-breaking which was to take place that evening. We were also glad to see such a large audience gathered in the Church auditorium on that occasion. And because of the fact that the steering committee had provided a good program, fitted to the occasion in which young and old partook, the meeting was a complete success; and to us is a proof of the progress of our congregation. And although we are at present without a pastor, we had the pleasure of having in our midst Mr. Rotschafer of Holland, Michigan, who will shortly travel to the Missionary field of India, who gave us a few glimpses concerning the missionary work in that country.",

The church was filled by those who were interested, and no wonder! This organization does something and does that something well. It numbers twenty-nine members and at least two hundred beneficiary members. Anyone can be a beneficiary member, who pays at least $1 per year. That this organization of young girls can and will work and is true to the motto, \"He who gives to the poor, loans to the Lord,\" has been proved during the past year by the setting aside of $25, for the foreign mission. And this year it has set aside $200, for the same purpose. The donations pay for the support of two Indian children in the mission station, Rehoboth, N. M. That is indeed an example worthy of following. The administration of that Society consists of the Rev. E. Breen, Honorary President; H. Bos, President, Miss Annie Mensinger, Vice-President, Miss Nellie Huiner, Secretary, Miss Dina Balk, Treasurer, and Miss Hatty Balk, Librarian."

If America in in the future is to receive immigrants at no expense to itself, and is to have them protected and Americanized at European expense, it must be that immigrants in America are considered to be a good investment. Unquestionably the requirement of certain standards of protection, with reference to working and living conditions in immigrant countries is to be an important consideration in determining what countries will be favored with immigration. Certain countries are already carrying heavt burdens, not only on account of the physical condition of their returning immigrants, but also because of financial burdens, due to their failure to succeed in new countries, a situation often due to prevailing conditions of employment. The Dutch Government has under consideration a plan for calling a conference of European States to consider this very question. This conference, when held, will doubtless raise the whole question of the desirability of having a system of protection which will take care of the immigrant from the time he leaves his home until he arrives at his final destination in the immigrant country.",

                "A reporter of the Chicago Daily News writes from Amsterdam, that the decision of the Department of Commerce at Washington to send a representative to the Dutch East Indies, fills the Netherlanders with hope of a return of American commerce. For a year past, the United States was not officially represented in the Dutch East Indies, commercially. There was fear, according to the correspondent, that on account of the strong influence of Germany in the Indian trade world, that the United States would turn cold shoulder to the Dutch East Indies. An official in the administration of the colonies told the correspondent that information concerning conditions in the East Indies was many times exaggerated and that the truth is not as told, but the opposite, that the Netherlands government is awake to the danger of German domination of the East Indian trade.",
                "This official also mentioned that confidence in the credit of the Dutch East Indies is growing stronger abroad. As proof of this fact, in the United States, there was subscribed $25,000,000 recently for Dutch East Indies obligations; in connection with this news, it was mentioned that organizations as the Netherlands Chamber of Commerce and the Netherland America Foundation, both situated in New York, are making all efforts to work together to make the Netherlands and its colonies better known in the United States."

Before her stands a small girl, looking at the little one with great interest. The girl who posed for this group, is now the present mayor of Rotterdam. The most able art experts here are speaking very highly of this picture. The color, the light and the grouping is excellent. Every Holland lover of art will find it worth while to pay a visit to our Art Institute to study this masterpiece.",

                "Aneta tells us: In connection with the reception, which our navy received in Japan, the Aneta office of the Hague, asked the Japanese Ambassador to Holland, concerning his opinion regarding the relations between Japan and the Netherland Colonies. We asked Mr. Kantaro Aschiai, if the banquets which took place, would have to be regarded as meaningless international formalities, or that there was really talk of friendship. His answer was thus: The Japanese, and first among them the merchants, still know that the Hollanders for a long time were the only Westerners, who had regular relations with Japan, and that the Japanese, thru the Netherlanders, came first in contact with Western civilization, who among other things taught them medical knowledge and about world commerce. No wonder that the Holland fleet is looked up to in Japan and that they indicated their feelings by giving them an especially hearty welcome. Added to this is the fact that in the last years the already lively trade with our colonies was made broader, and the Japanese wish that these economic relations would become still closer. In the signing of peace, the ambassador does not expect a reversal of these relations, but the reverse. When we hinted as to the distrust, that many in our colonies and in the Netherlands have, about the purposes of the evermore powerful Japan, Mr. Kantoaro Aschiai said that there is no reason for distrust. Japan wishes without any ulterior motives to keep good relations with Holland and its colonies. The just appointed Ambassador, Mr. Philips, also granted an interview to a representative of the Aneta office about the commercial relations of his America and our overseas colonies.",
                "The Ambassador gave as his views, that an entirely new era starts for American-Dutch Indies relations on economic grounds, now that the war is ended and the United States has emerged from it stronger, commercially. Before the war America's commercial fleet was insignificent, so that very little was exported and they busied themselves mainly with raw materials such as flour and other foodstuffs. During the war many ships were built for transports and the carrying of arms and ammunitions, but which now will be used for the export trade, as well as the ships still building. There is now in America a new spirit, not of isolation, but one that calls for expansion in world commerce, instead of staying within their own borders. The colossal strength of American industry has grown up with that spirit. America can supply the world markets with many products of industry and in return receive in trade such articles as she herself does not possess and which other parts of the world can supply. We do not have to worry about the high tariff so said Mr. Philips as he viewed them, as of a fiscal nature. Now as far as the relations with our colonies goes, the Ambassador expects a quick development, for not only are the colonies easily reached from America, but the American people also get along well with the Hollanders. He predicts then a lively attendance at the coming feasts of the Pilgrim Fathers. The Ambassador hopes that many Americans will visit our country on this occasion.",
                "When we spoke of the opinion in America about us in connection with the antipathy, which existed in many countries who participated in the war, his excellency answered that our country suffered no more of that, than the rest of the neutrals, but that in America the feeling was not as high as in the other mentioned lands. However, there is now nothing left of this animosity, if it ever existed. The American industrialist and trader is anxious, as soon as possible, to do business with the Netherlands. Some technical obstacles, which are still in the way of the regular trade must be credited to circumstance, that the United States officially is still at war with Germany.",
                "Every part of the American people is striving for normal conditions to better their positions as far as trade is concerned, then before the war. In this connection, Mr. Philips said it was a lucky thought to send a committee to America. Whether or not they succeeded he was unable to say, but was sure that many American Business men were glad to learn more of the Netherlands trade and industry conditions. We are of the opinion that the people of America interest themselves more with Holland, than do the Hollanders with America. His excellency spoke with sympathy of the Holland Ambassador, Mr. Cremer, whom he gives credit for furthering peaceful relations during his stay at Washington. Also about the Netherlands, Mr. Philips had a good word to say. In the short time of his stay in Holland, the population had already given him the impression, which he had expected, an impression of prosperity and influence, and of good will to less prosperous countries, and hospitality toward strangers. With pleasure he starts his new task."

The line springs from Arent Meindertzoon Fabricius of Haarlem, one of the oldest among the defenders of Ostend in the Spanish siege from 1601 to 1604. After the fall of Ostend Fabricius was honored by the states of Holland and Belgium with a silver chalice in token of their gratitude for his faithful services.",

These things were presented to the city of Haarlem by Baron J. C. W. Fabricius in 1883. The cover of the chalice is inlaid with a view of the besieged fortress, showing the position of the batteries, and the camp of the Spaniards.",

And this Dr. Heldring was the great-grandson of a certain Captain Heldring who as commandant of the royal guards accompanied Prince William the Third on his voyage to England when William became king of England.",

I have no doubt that you will call the attention of your readers to this plan and will give an opportunity to those who wish to contribute to this cause to do so. A short time after the happy event takes place the sum which has been subscribed could be collected and through your [journal as] medium be turned over to me; I would send it to the treasurer of a committee to be formed, which according to the wish of various Dutch committees would consist of only a few ladies, under the leadership of Mrs. Louden, wife of our ambassador at Washington. Inasmuch as her Majesty has proclaimed her wish that the gift of the Dutch people shall be used for a charitable cause, negotiations are being carried on to fulfill her Majesty's desire. Then the proceeds of our collection will be turned over to the main committee in the Netherlands, after the deduction of the sum necessary to print a beautiful album, to contain the names of all the donors and their biographies and to be illustrated with pictures of the \"New Netherlanders\" and if possible with [photographs] of the present Dutch settlements in this country and of everything in connection with them."

As Netherlanders by birth or descent, the Knickerbocker Society deemed it proper, because of the choice of the people, to elevate Judge De Young to one of the highest positions in the state, and to honor him with a luncheon. More than thirty distinguished guests took part in this affair. After an interesting speech by the president, Mr. Gilmer Vuiper, the floor was given to the Netherlands Consul General Hon. John Vennema, who pointed out the high spots in the life of Judge De Young, whom he had learned to know a quarter of a century ago as a young lawyer, and the progress of whom as a public official, he had followed with great interest.",

He was followed by L. Holstein, who without preparation and in a fascinating way, told the listeners that it is an honor to belong to the citizens of Holland blood. One of the city's aldermen, Wiley W. Mills, of Dutch descent and graduate of Hope College, in a beautiful way praised the guest of honor, after a few words had been spoken by a representative of this paper. Finally, the chair was given to Judge De Young, who heartily spoke his appreciation of all the compliments and for the luncheon. He said, among other things, that he was thankful that his fellow citizens of Dutch race, appreciated that one of them was elevated to the office that he now takes at Springfield. There were a couple of pleasant hours which in the annals of this club, next to those of other pleasure gatherings also held in the City Club, will be held in happy remembrance."

                "Monday noon, the last remains of the 70 year old minister, the Rev. William Greve, were entrusted to the earth in Mount Greenwood cemetary. He was known by nearly every Dutchman in Chicago, loved by many, and honored by everyone who knew him. It was a solemn moment. The 74 year old widow was the only one of the relations who was present at the interment. But what the couple missed on blood relations, was well compensated for by the large number of friends they had made. The church of the 71st Street congregation, where the funeral services were held, was filled by those interested in rendering to the Rev. Greve their last respects. The services at the home were led by the Rev. Poppen, one of the most trusted friends of the deceased, and at the church speeches were made in the order given by the Pastors Van Dellen, Breen, Einink, Kuiper and Van Uliet, while at the grave the Rev. Van Dellin leddin prayer. The Rev. Grave was born January 16, 1836, in the county of Bentheim, where his father, Willem Greve, was a gardener. Mr. Greve, the father, was financially able to give his children a good education, and they were taught in a school with the Bible, which at that time in Bentheim was the public school. From his childhood the young William felt a longing to study for the ministry, a longing which resulted in his conversion to God. His conversion and the manner of living he assumed through that, were the cause of his being cast aside by the family. Yes, even despised and banished.",
                "Although his father was a religious man, true conversion was for him a strange business. The attempts made by the young man to become a minister were fruitless. This was the reason that he resolved to try his luck in the \"New World\". He journied to Cincinnati, where he had preached the gospel many tines before private or public gatherings, until, at last, the now deceased Rev. D. J. Van der Werp, provided funds for his education in the ministry. In 1869 he became a preacher. He served the following congregations in order, Chicago, Cincinnati, Passaic, N. J., Borculo, Mich, and Grandville Avenue, Grand Rapids, Mich. In both of the first mentioned congregations he served twice. Later, after a well earned rest, he served the congregation at Hull, Iowa. He was a man who wanted and had to work for, the cause of the gospel. The ministry was his life. This was also the reason he made so many friends. His most beloved place was Chicago. When he obtained his diploma, he first moved to Pella - Iowa, but his longing for Chicago was too great, He sold his possessions in Pella and went to live in this city, in restful Englewood, where he spent his last days. In the last few weeks of his life he suffered greatly from asthma and Brights disease which made an end to his life, may his remains rest in peace."
