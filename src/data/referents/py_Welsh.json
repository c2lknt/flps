When our churches and church organizations will appreciate Zion\u2019s music, they will see the beautiful Zion is not so now, but once in a while a flash of the beautiful, even in this day, is heard and felt through the influence of music that has been composed and sung by consecrated people, and its influence stretches farther than we can imagine.

Speaking of the current rumors that there is discord among the Welshmen in relation to the formation of the international festival, Mr. Powell said yesterday: \u201cWe have been successful thus far in securing the cooperation of the best musical and literary talent among our people. We have distributed over 10,000 pamphlets throughout Great Britain within the last month, to which the most encouraging replies have been received. The National Association now in session at Swansea, Wales, has officially recognized our efforts and will send a deputation of the Gorsedd here at the time agreed upon. There are something over 2,500,000 Welshmen in this country, nine-tenths of whom will indirectly, at least, contribute to the success of the distinctively characteristic festival. There is no discord and there will be none beyond the discord which may arise from a friendly difference of opinion as to the best methods to be adopted. True there might be and doubtless there are some personal jealousies, but those jealousies will not and can not materially abridge the scope and success of the great enterprise.",

It was the social banquet of the National Cymrodorian Society, and everything was Welsh from the menu to the strange and somewhat dissonant melodies that were sung. The toasts were responded to in English. It was an unique entertainment, and one that was thoroughly enjoyed by the hundred \u201ctrue-hearted sons and daughters\u201d of Wales present.",

It was a song too unlike anything heard in American to be soon forgotten. So also was \u201cLlywn On,\u201d which was sung by Mrs. Anna Lewis- Kimball. George R. Davis responded to the toast \u201cThe World\u2019s Columbian Exposition.\u201d D. V. Samuels spoke of \u201cThe Cymrodorian and the International Eisteddfod of 1893.\u201d The Rev. Jenkin Lloyd Jones responded to the toast \u201cThe Press.\u201d Miss Grace E. Jones sang the Welsh melody \u201cClychan Aberdyfi.\u201d One of the most striking features of the program, however, was the harp solo \u201cMarch of the Men of Harlech\u201d by Robert Griffith.

Jenkin Lloyd Jones, who was to deliver the address, arrived fifteen to twenty minutes before that time. They found the doors locked and Janitor Collier announced that no one had made arrangements for the hall, and that some on would have to be responsible for the rent before he would open the doors. The Rev. Mr. Jones, in the absence of the committee, volunteered, ad this difficulty was overcome. It was explained that the engaging of the hall had been left to a committee of two and that both gentlemen had been called out of the city.",

He said that in the future arrangements would be made so that these meetings should not conflict with those of the Church.",

He said it was the intention in founding the modern church to erect a building which would contain in its basement bath-rooms, a gymnasium and a bowling alley. The main floor would be fitted up as a reading a writing room, the tables would be provided for games, etc. On the upper floor would be the auditorium. There would be no pastor, and no collection, and the seats would be free. Meetings would be held each Sunday, and the workers would be give the opportunity of listening to men of all thought. For the present the meetings would be held in Brick Layer\u2019s Hall and would alternate with the Trade and Labor assembly, which meets the first and third Sundays of each month. Two weeks hence there will be a discussion between the Rev. Mr. Burch, secretary of the Ministers\u2019 Association, and William C. Pomeroy. It has not yet been decided whether the discussion shall take place in Brick Layers\u2019 Hall or Centenary Church.",

Mr. Jones as the speaker of the day, who took his text from the fortieth verse of the twenty-sixth chapter of Matthew: \u201cWhat would ye not watch with me one hour?\u201d He said these words were the cry of a soul for sympathy, the groan of the heart for companionship. This cry of the great Teacher in the garden was the wail of the centuries, and was the most fundamental thought of man, the highest privilege of religion to gratify. If he should be the subject of this afternoon\u2019s thought into one word it would be sympathy.",

                "The movement to establish a modern church carried with it great and prophetic interest. It indicated that the God of the Old and New Testament still lived. The church should be established on the root of sympathy. In it all prejudices should be buried. The road to sympathy was the near dear, holy road of service. The modern church should be the church of the good Samaritan \u2013 the good Samaritan brought down to the nineteenth century. The church that did not do anything in this world was not a modern church \u2013 not even an antiquity. It was a nuisance and a stumbling block, and should be put out of the way. It brought religion into disrepute.",

The object of this department was to make it possible for serious students in country towns to obtain the essentials of a conservatory education in music, and to earn credentials without the expense and inconvenience of leaving home. This was accomplished by affiliating qualified and established teachers in outside communities and enrolling pupils in a course of study paralleling that given by the main school in Chicago, the studies conducted by an affiliated teacher. This course of study was in printed text form, and embraced theory lessons and annotated exercises, studies and compositions. The course was divided into eight grades, and led to a diploma. Those who wished to go further with their music and work for advanced credentials at the main school, could lay a thorough foundation at home upon which to build when they went away. While those who did not wish to go further, had acquired a good music education at home.",
