It was used as a harbinger of these powers to promulgate religious doctrines, to dictate military movements, subdue the weak, to control production, freedom of thought and defenders of right. The right to express opinions was not permitted, and the public had to be subjected to the caprices of their egoistic rulers.",

It had to undergo most difficult struggles in its progress. It met obstruction on one hand, and impelling forces on the other. Time passed and the newspaper grew to be a power of the first magnitude, which produced tension on controversial questions each day. The desire to predominate exerts itself in those of the so called power class and the group which may be classed as hypocrites. They desire to hold the mass in ignorance and thereby strangle its liberty, obstruct justice and decry public rights. But their predominance is fading and the people are throwing off, more and more, their shackles.",

Thus, the newspaper has been good and bad; in the hands of the unscrupulous, it has done much damage, while in the hands of the righteous, it has been a constructive force.",

In all of these faults, of which the majority of the Mexicans are accused, there are some which are, in a way, true; however, we do not fail to recognize all that is just. How are we to respond, when we are treated as assassins? If we look into the past, we will actually see that we have, in times gone by, committed murders (made characteristic of us because our uncalled-for faults are not individualized, Mexicans being spoken of in general).",

This consists in guiding his children through the narrow path of right, and seeing that they obtain a good education; in seeing that they do not fall victims of falsehoods and fantasies. In a word, to see that the scheme of education develops a true spirit of friendship and a true spirit of sociability among these sons or daughters who are to correct the evils of our elders.",
                "This offspring, if we make it possible for them to receive a good education, and give them the advantage of our experience, may then be well fitted to fill their place in society. They will not be criminals, because their early life has been set up along the line of honesty and integrity. And, naturally, they will be disinclined to fantasies and the spirit of vice and crimnality. This is the first calling of the head of a family; even if there are some who maintain that all men found with the obligation of family, are not in a position to give an education to their children, because of the lack of funds. This objection may be answered in this manner:",
                "The man who desires a good education for his children, and who has no resources with which to give it to them, will find some way to do this job. He will start by sacrificing everything considered of little importance. With this effort, it will be found that the task is not so great as was anticipated, and the results which accrue to the children for exceed the sacrifice.",
                "The second approach, which is considered more convincing is this: If we do not wish to be victims of ourselves, and wish to stop the attack which we encounter at every step from those men of distinct nationalities, and not be victims of brute force, that they, as well as we, have used up to the present time in order to stain one or the other with blood, we should organize to form a union which will stand for the principle of confraternity, a sacred duty which we have to fulfill, one for the other. Likewise, we should put a premium on the up-building of all groups: to seek all means suitable to giving our children the best education possible. We should join every force which seeks to combat crime among our group.",
                "Mexicans! if we wish to have the good name of our dear mother-country respected, let us give effect to our beliefs and form a society which will have for its purpose the intellectual and moral advancement of all groups and other race brothers.

They seldom have enough for a period of idleness, and work is always scarce in the winter. The first winter here is a hard one.Those already established lend a neighborly hand and do all they can to alleviate the suffering. The cold weather adds to the suffering for the supply of clothing, bedding, and furniture is very meager. The Mexican Consul tried to prevent this suffering during the winter by inserting a notice in the chief Mexican papers warning the people not to come to Chicago in the winter expecting to get work. Many, however, did not see this notice.",

                "The Mexicans are establishing accounts at various banks. The Mexicans in the Hull-House neighborhood particularly favor the Atlas State Bank, which opened a Spanish department in October, 1927, with a Mexican from Michoacan in charge. He reports about 600 Mexican depositors, most of whom have savings accounts, and about 400 other Mexican customers who come largely to buy New York drafts to send to Mexico. Depositors are given this service free, but others pay the usual fee for the drafts, and the bank furnishes addressed envelopes in which the drafts may be mailed.",
                "An employee of the bank reported that one Mexican family returned from the Michigan beet fields last winter and made a deposit of $800, the amount that the mother, father, and three children cleared by their summer's work. This is believed to be the largest Mexican deposit, for generally the savings from the beet work are much less; but average amount of these bank accounts is $600. In another Halsted Street bank there is no Spanish department, and the officers do not think that the Mexican business is sufficient to warrant the establishment of one, but there are several Mexicans in the Christmas Club of this bank. They report several Mexican depositors with balances building accounts, but the great number of their Mexican depositors do not build balances.They sell New York drafts to Mexicans, charging the usual fees. Still another bank on Halsted Street has in charge of its Spanish department a man who came from Argentina two years ago, having been educated in Spanish in the schools of Buenos Aires.",
                "This bank states that the number of Mexican, accounts reaches eighty during the summer. Many of the Mexican depositors in this bank live in box cars on railroad sidings. These box cars are moved about as work demands; the Mexicans, therefore, have no permanent mail addresses. The bank has established the custom of supplying their customers with envelopes addressed to the bank. The Mexicans write their names on these envelopes and inclosed them when writing to their families and friends in Mexico. These letters are then held at the bank until called for by their owners.",
                "As to the relations of the Mexicans to business enterprises, it may be noted that there are near Hull-House fourteen restaurants, five pool halls, five grocery stores, one barber-shop, one shoemaker, four bakeries, one meat market, one print shop, two sign painter shops, one photograph gallery, one tailor shop, and one music shop, owned and operated by Mexicans.",
                "These are all on a small scale. The other neighborhoods have similar business enterprises, but not so numerous as in the Hull-House neighborhoods. South Chicago adds a drug store to the list of business activities.",
                "In the University of Chicago Settlement district the railroads and Packing Companies furnish work for the Mexicans. When any of these industries reduces labor, it is the Mexican who suffers most. They are the last to arrive and the first to be laid off. The Mexicans who have been here more than one winter have learned to save money for the slack time. The Peoples Stockyards Bank reported more than 1,000 Mexican depositors; and the bank across the street, the Depositors State Bank, reported 150 Mexican depositors. The packing companies hire their own men, as do most of the railroads in the neighborhood.",
                "There were formerly two labor agencies on Halsted Street, but both went out of business during the industrial depression of the winter of 1928. The South Chicago Mexicans are largely employed by the steel mills. Each mill has its own employment office. Men are employed and given work numbers. The Mexicans have a custom of selling or lending these numbers to other Mexicans when they wish to leave the work. Sometimes they sell the numbers outright, and again they charge a fee for their use while the rightful owner makes a trip to Mexico or tries his luck in other employment. The foremen do not seem to be aware of this practice. Perhaps all the Mexicans look alike to them. When it is necessary to check on the Mexican's work record, his assumed name must be known. When the Mexicans get into trouble, they give the names under which they are employed, and not their own names.",
                "The hours of work in the steel mills are as follows. In the Illinois Steel Mill, laborers work from seven in the morning to five thirty in the afternoon; others work from eleven at night to seven the next morning, seven in the Morning to three in the afternoon, and three in the afternoon to eleven at night. In the Wisconsin Steel Mills all men work eight hours per day. Their shifts are from 2; P. M. to 10: P. M.; 10:P. M. to 6:A.M. and 6: A.M. to 2:P.M. Wages of the Mexicans in the steel industries vary from 42 1/2 cents per hour for a ten-hour day for common laborers to 54 cents per hour for an eight-hour day with a Saturday half-holiday received by molders. When the mills lay off for long periods the men generally ship out for somewhere else. A few who have families provide for unemployment, by saving during employment. Generally the men do not bring their families until they have a regular job.",
                "The Illinois Steel Mills have what is known as a Good Fellows' Club. The employees pay a small weekly fee which entitles them to borrow money from the club, or to be taken care of in case of necessity. All employees are of course protected by the Workmen's Compensation Act. The Company also fosters a group insurance policy whereby the employees receive a death benefit by the payment of a small weekly premium.",
                "SCHOOLS AND RECREATIONS",
                "Reference has already been made to the schools attended by Mexican children, and Table I shows the enrollment of some of the Mexican children in the schools by grades. Not all the schools report their Mexican enrollment by grades, and the table serves only as a general indication of the grade distributing.",
                "Table I shows the locations of the schools enrolling Mexican children and the number of Mexican children enrolled in each. The large number of children in the first grade shows, as has been stated before, that many of the families have only young children and that many others are just beginning their study of English. It is generally the single men or families with one or two children who come to Illinois. The number in the open-window-rooms is possible indication of the poor economic status of the Mexican families here. When pay is low, work irregular, and living quarters poor and crowded with little or no sunshine, it follows that the children's physical condition will suffer. The number of Mexican children in the eighth grade seems quite creditable, since most of these children are well beyond the compulsory educational law requirements as to age, and the economic conditions of many of the families is such that it is a real sacrifice to keep the children in school rather than to allow them to take jobs.",
                "The number enrolled in Catholic schools is 162, or 9.8 percent of the total enrollment in elementary schools. While the school enrollment shows concentration in the Hull-House, the University of Chicago Settlement and the South Chicago neighborhoods, it is interesting to note that the families are moving west and north into better houses and more desirable neighborhoods. They are in fact found as far north as the three thousand block on Seminary and as far west as Trumbull Avenue.",
                "Recreation in the Hull-House neighborhood is limited almost entirely to that provided by Hull-House and the Fireman House Settlement."

If we are to judge the gravity of the ill by the exterior we must accept that the present generation is very much contaminated when it shows such corrupted grounds as those subsequently related to the absolution of divorce. This is the most diabolic attempted directed against the divine family institution whose tides end to be corrupted under the concealed hypothesis of reasonable motives.",

But in the end, they will sink as the drug addict, into a living flame and if God does not interfere they may continue their existence in a state of constant frenzy, as those who inhabit the lowest ranks of humanity.",

In vain has it tried to put a stop to such inconsistent wave that may drown the last vestiges of personal dignity."

If in the first case, when he entered the hospital he was asked whom they should notify in case of death. When this happened we hated to go to see him. In the second case it is hoped that after a certain period has elapsed the interested party will find out and will generally go to the police station some time after they have had no communication from the deceased whos body very kindly was frozen to avoid decomposition while waiting to be claimed for burial. The great majority of the people in the Mexican Colony are single men who come to this country to improve their conditions but whose relatives, reside in Mexico. Many of them make friends but so lightly as they can not even remember the names or the number of the street they live on. When interrogated at the hospital they can not give a correct address. Practically they are along lost among four million people, and fifteen thousands of our own nationals in Chicago."

In order to imitate the severe fasting practiced by Christ in the wilderness for a period of forty days. In preparing ourselves for such holy celebration we must keep very strictly the fast ordeal and if possible the mortification of flesh not only depriving ourselves of illicit things, but of those things that we consider licit as well, by becoming moderate to such attractions as entertainments.

The merit of the Mass and of the rosary. It is permissible to announce in a loud voice before beginning each tenth, but it is not of an absolute necessity when it is prayed in privacy. It is more valuable to pray with pause, once, than one thousand times in haste. He who wishes to secure his salvation must commend himself to the sacred Mary through the rosary devotion. She has clearly stated: \"The soul that is commended through the rosary shall not perish\"."

No fooling! Of the many types that I am going to speak of, there is one in whom I can be identified. I cannot say which one, because that would be too much self exposure for whoever unveils his soul is in danger of being scoffed at, lapidated and even exploited. I am not ready to suffer the consequences, (why should I?) as one of my cousins would say. (A Mexican usually calls the American, a cousin).",

In the course of this study we may speak of ironical things if necessary, but, it shall be truth as I understand it. By the way, let me say that my intention has been and shall be to speak plain, so I can be understood. It wouldn't be my fault if what I say is mal-intrepreted, for we know that a lack of comprehension is one of the greatest ailments afflicting us most severely. May I say, that my attitude has been toward constructive things and if it has not produced the effects desired, it is due to the arid soil I have tried to cultivate. As social leaders, we may consider them, (even though they are not) all those who take an active part in the guidance of a social group, thus it is necessary to have some term to designate them.",
                "There is a variation of types, even though in appearance they may look the same. They have come to the scenery of our social life, and precisely to this variety is due the lamentable failure in the accomplishment of a social work.",
                "The different characters of our leaders have been manifested in the methods they have employed upon the same undertaking. We have had dreamers, idealists, ill-intentioned,selfish, true patriots and mouth piece patriots, but the ignorant elements have predominated, having been characterized by one or more of the afore said qualities, have figured prominently, but unjustly. And specially to these people is due the disorganization of the colony. It is because them that has always existed the enmity amongst our social groups particularly when something is being done for the unification of the colony. It is because them, also, that those who have intended the confederation of Mexican societies, have failed completely in bringing mutual understanding, proper orientation and a more coordinated work. And if we add to these, newspaper editors who have a lack of civil courage, who from time to time have come to enlighten us, we complete then the group really responsible for the disorganization we are now lamenting. The newspaper men that I speak of are responsible, because they have tried to evade their responsibility, they have not been concrete when they should, that is to say when we tried to cure the ailment which caused the decay in our social organism.",
                "The masses cannot be blamed because of their unconsciousness, we must take into consideration that mental development is a slow process. Very frequently we have heard that the colony does not respond to the call when something beneficial is intended, but that is a false affirmation. During my stay in Chicago, I have noticed the large contributions made by our colony for different purposes. The colony has been defrauded of such contributions by unscrupulous individuals,in other words, pickpockets and thieves who appropiate to themselves that which is entrusted into their care. Many cases of these nature have occurred, that is why the colony within its unconsciousness refuses to support our leaders. The story shall be different the day when a sound and well directed group may be formed, and above all with well-intentioned aims. The unification of the colony, in order to be effective, must be conscious, intelligent, and honestly directed."

For the reasons mentioned he should, therefore, avail himself of all means possible to see that the money invested in these festivities by members of the Colony is not diverted to gratuities and other expenditures not fully justified.

The object of said institution was to give a mutual and collective aid to the Mexican people in the field of culture and education and to offer an opportunity to the Mexican children to express themselves in sports, art and in other phases of education. This, however, gave us the impression that we would soon see the Mexican colony occupying a place of honor among the other foreign colonies in this modern 'Babylon' called Chicago. The time passed and we heard of this project no more, so, we thought that this talk was just a momentary flame, which lasted only while being discussed. During all this time we were wondering as to the reason for remaining inactive and defenseless amidst a fearful misery affecting many of our homes and outrages suffered by many of our people.",

Due to our own negligence, either willingly of forcibly we are compelled to join the public charities. Therefore, we say that only through a strong organization we can,to a certain extent, overthrow the hostile propaganda voiced in some of the newspapers who accuse us of being a burden to the Relief institutions, a menace to the public health, and a hindrance to the estability and advancement of the life of the native worker. One other reason adduced by the organizing committee, is the development of our social life, of which we feel happy because they thought of so important part. After the presentation of this project by the committee, there will be a dance and a real moment of expansion for all. Dear countrymen: Let us form the Centro Mexicano."

When the industrialist and agriculturist of the West and Southwest import Mexican workers he imports at the same time people who are full of susceptibilities. The profit the industrialists make by paying cheap wages is more than counter-balanced by the taxes they have to pay for charitable purposes. The Indian within the confines of the United States soon became infected with the vices of the white man. He was not adaptable to urban life. His race died out without any serious repercussion upon the white man. Dr. Goldberg believes that all the Mexicans are uncivilized Indians and that they still carry bows and arrows. This doctor should be better informed before making such a blunder.",

After that time the regulations of 1924 came into effect but in spite of that, 42,000 entered this country in 1926, and 66,000 in 1927. The number of Mexicans who died of tuberculosis in 1927 was 97.1 per 100,000 against 87.7 per 100,000 which is the average in Chicago.\"",

Christianism and Communism are in itself antagonistic to each other, thus where one exists, the other cannot exist. The Christian Proletarian should be a group whose members have acknowledged through rational analyses that it is impossible to have an economic and material equality. Since all the people cannot produce the same, they can not possess the same. Even though the impossible should occur at a given moment, not all the people would be able to keep it.",
                "Some because of larger families, others due to a free expenditure on vice, or ill adminstration. However, there are many inevitable differences in production, Therefore, the Communist equality is not only an awkard chimera, but also an unjustified system. The Communist Proletariat is, in the contrary, the conglomeration of workers who have been seduced and deceived through false promises, which is an unjust impossibility as we have demonstrated above.",

                "For many years there has existed a certain difference between the Medical and Dental professions with respect to infection and disorder set up in the human body because of teeth decay. However, during the last four or five years a firm alliance and\"practice arrangement\" has been worked between the two professions, and today they are working jointly in promoting good health.",
                "The medical profession admit that 70 percent of rheumatism, 50 percent of heart disease, 50 percent of neuralgia and disturbances of the liver and kidneys, many of these maladies proving fatal, are caused by disorder or infection of the oral cavity; that is, the mouth.",
                "In the mouth, we not only find the teeth, the decay of which is the cause of suffering and systematic infection, as has been indicated, but besides Gingivitis is set up; that is to say, inflammation of and wasting away of the gums, having the same effect of distruction as pyorrhea. This wasting away of tissue continues into the mucous membrane lining of the mouth, which is susceptible to infections. Then, there is the tongue so important and so liable to cancer in the presence of decayed and broken teeth. Again, the salivary glands whose secretion is so necessary to proper digestion may be effected by disorder in the mouth. A disordered condition in the mouth may and usually does cause infection of the pharynx, called Pharyngitis, an adenoids, the infection of which may cause serious consequences.",
                "The exercise of the jawbones in the proper mastication of our food is very essential to good digestion. Another essential is that the food remain in the mouth long enough to stimulate the salivary glands and fully absorbe sufficient saliva so that good digestion may take place.",
                "From these facts it is clear that sound and perfect teeth are absolutely necessary. A lacking of these means that our food cannot be properly broken up in the mouth. Then when this insufficiently masticated food enters the stomach this organ is upset, in that it has to secrete more than a normal amount of gastric juice to prepare the food for further digestion. The net result is, that in time this most essential organ is damaged causing serious consequences to the body as a whole.",
                "The formation of a set of teeth begins in the prenatal age. Then in order to assure the unborn baby properly developed and formed teeth, much attention should be given to the diet of the future mother. This means that the diet should be made up of fresh and natural foods, pure water, exercise in pure air, and daily walks outdoors, exposing as much of the body as possible to the sun. The irremissible decalcification of the enamel of a woman's teeth at this important stage should receive the best of care. This can be effected by proper hygienic care of the mouth. There is no reason why so noble a Being should be brought into this world handicapped in its most tender age and suffer conditions which could have been avoided.",
                "If one is ignorant of proper prenatal care proper advice should be sought in the early stage of pregnancy and before danger becomes serious.",
                "Children should receive special attention due to the delicate condition of their bodies and to their inability to care for themselves. Proper care to the needs of children in their most tender age will make it possible for them to avoid such maladies as typhoid and scarlet fever, small-pox, meningitis, bronchitis, measles and others generally called childrens diseases. Any one of these may prove fatal or leave the child crippled or otherwise handicapped throughout life. If the child is given proper hygienic care all of these maladies may be avoided. The adult should also see that he himself be well informed on the ways and means of conserving health and with this his happiness and well being in this life is assured."

                "Mr. Valle has the most interesting array of art I have ever seen. He expresses his work as follows: \"There we have exclusively Mexican art in clay, wood, leather, feathers, glass, cloth, rugs, hats, furniture, etc. For instance we have these silhouettes much of different kinds of cloth portraying Mexican types, cowboys, girls in national costume, bull fights, etc. Rugs of intricate Maya and Aztec designs. Hand blown blue glass work. Pottery made so as to resemble blue steel as you can see you can not tell it is clay; the meticulous design does not leave any details untouched so it will look like steel. We have leather works, cigarette cases with Aztec and Maya motives. The wood carvings are exceptional pieces of art because of the careful and detailed patterns. We have been commended by the press of Chicago in the beautiful feather work we have. We make birds in their original colors and with their own feathers in different sizes;as pictures, also calling cards. In pottery work we have cooking dishes, table sets, exotic Mexican motives and animal designs; they are grotesque but very amusing and artistic. The Mexican girls are dressed in native costumes.",

                "Chicago and nearby towns shelters a considerable number of Mexican people and if I dare make these calculations, there must be over sixty thousand Mexicans, mostly from the States of Michoacan, Jalisco, and Guanajuato which in fact form the mass unity of our race. And is due to this fact, perhaps, that the local sentimental artistic elements possesses such a clean cut principle.",
                "An evident proof of this is the Mexican Band of South Chicago, which is conducted by the well known and studious professor and composer, my good friend Cirilo Rodriguez. He is a natural product from one of the States that I have already mentioned, whose worthiness have been manifested in the organization of his modest but studious band of South Chicago.",

It is well known that a cultured and educated people, well prepared for its civic functions will not tolerate oppression nor tyrannies. Thence being already away from darkness our people have endeavoured to develop its artistic faculties\".",
                "Without going very far, let us briefly, mention the musical organization formed by Professor Gumaro Ortiz who with his thirty-six musicians has given very good concerts which have deserved favorable comments from the American public and foreigners as well. Gumaro Ortiz has built a musical organization that now constitutes a Band beginning with a very small group.",
                "So when, a few days ago we had the pleasure to attend the formal presentation of the Mexican Band of Chicago, which in doing so placed a high mark in the composition of music, we listened to a beautiful concert under the very skillful leadership of Professor Cirilo Rodriguez who recently composed the march \"Captain Carranza\" and added a victory to those already deservingly won. The formal presentation took place at Hull House, there, we were able to appreciate once more his artistic faculties.",
                "On that memorable night our artists executed very difficult, selections that only great professors have been able to execute. The applauses abounded in excess and to that Cirilo Rodriguez must be proud because, he has been able to climb one more step in the difficult musical art. Our astonishment, speaking therefore in accordance with the various opinions of the attending public, consisted precisely in that Maestro Rodriguez' Band is composed mostly of young people averaging 20 years of age which is a guarantee for us that our young blood is marching forward.",
                "Probably, the most acclaimed musician of the group was a cornet-player who is thirteen years of age. A more beautiful and deserving act cannot be found anywhere. Music, as well as many other arts is a tonic that fortifies the people, injecting the noble and positive feelings among those who cultivate it and amongst these are our young people who form the various Mexican musical organizations of Chicago and vicinities.",
                "In this populous ham city as some humorists have denominated Chicago we count with another musical organization which is the sprout of Maestro Francisco Calderon. This great group was formed in not less than three years and its results manifested; in many concerts we have been astonished for they have turned to be real musicians in spite of the fact that they are just beginners in the difficult art of music. But a misfortune made the director slacken and thereby certain economic upsets which I do not wish to mention because of respect I have for Francisco Calderon and his intelligent boys who form the Mexican band of Chicago.",
                "It has been spoken of defalcation, a suit was filed and the logic result was the separation of the organizer who worked so hard only to see his hopes failed. Besides these bands, we have also some orchestras who are formed by Mexican elements, among them are Jose Reyes, Ignacio M. Valle, Simon Atilano and Ricardo Valle A, the last one besides being a composer, is also a good photographer. He is the author of that sentimental Waltz, Dolores Del Rio, nothing less than the name of our Lolita, honor and distinction of our country who is honoring us in a foreign land.",
                "Why should I continue mentioning further, when I already said that our colony is composed of sentimental artists? It would be useless since the whole world is perfectly informed of it."

                "It is a rare treat to see a departure from either the conservative or the radical schools of painting that is unusual enough to be called an artistic innovation which at the same time the average man can understand and appreciate it without the aid of an interpreter. The exhibit by the eminent Mexican artist Enrique Dusolier Laureola, of painting on tile, at Fred Leighton's Indian Trading Post, 619 North Michigan Avenue, is as different from the academic and modern school as the materials and textures of its presentation. It is an artistic innovation of beauty as to execution and design.",
                "RAPHEL - LIKE TECHNIQUE",
                "There is a Raphael-like technique combined with the bolder methods of later artists in his \"Crucified Christ\" as conceived by the Indians of Mexico. It is presented on the blocks that have been fitted into a frame for hanging or easel showing. Each tile is about 4x4 inches. The paintings are done by a secret process that was achieved after years of research by the artist, who also is professor of the history of art in the University of Mexico.",
                "The finest and most delicate shades of coloring are applied to the tile in a manner that fixes the colors so securely that they will be preserved for all time. Taureola has presented in this manner the image of Christ that the Indians were supposed to have been shown by the Christian fathers who came to the Aztec empire as missionaries four centuries ago. The leg end says that the image was on a medal, an image so realistic and human of the agony of Christ that his expression thus portrayed accounted for the miracle of conversion.",
                "OTHER FINE WORKS",
                "In addition to this masterpiece of color and workmanship there are others as finely done as miniatures in the old art galleries of Europe. Among them are \"The Assault\" in soft colors, a medieval street fight in a latin land; a reproduction of \"Picador\", the original of which is in the Del Prado, Madrid Spain; \"The Convent of Churubuso\", in a lovely lavender sepiashade, a drawing with pastelike crayon that also was fixed by fire like the major works; \"The Patio Colonial\", an example of one of the beautiful houses of the period when Mexico was a Spanish colony. As to the secret process:each color and shade given in the painting proper implies determined degree of cooking by fire. The sketch is done first and then each tile is individually painted and burnt for preservation. The work is guaranteed against all discoloration and deterioration by the elements. The artist has gone far beyond the ordinary Mexican tile and pottery craftsmen for whom Mexico is justly famous. There are also on exhibit at the Trading Post some fine works of Awa-Se-Day, the Pueblo Indian artist whose colors have become noted for their pictorial art of the aborigines."

When she was only 15 years old, she joined a vaudeville show, travelled through Spain, and then went to Cuba, where she departed after having conquered an enormous success in Mexico and in Central America.

While in Chicago she stays amongst her countrymen and always ready to continue her career with more tenacity than ever. She and Paco make an ideal team. There is not one dance which these two luminaries of the stage cannot perform, from the Mexican Jarabe tapatio, (Tap Dance) our beautiful national dance, to the \"Tetabe,\" a Bedoine dance which she learned with such a mastery while she was in Moroccan."

We reached the hotel about 11:00 o'clock in the morning and were courteously received by him. It is necessary for us to mention part of his life's career, which has been a path of thorns and at times one of flowers.",

Pedro Rubin is a Mexican, he was born in the year of 1900 at San Luis Potosi, from a modest family His first and only vocation was that of a dancer, that is why, when he was very young dedicated himself to the study of it. He made his debut at the \"Salon Mexicano\" in Mexico City in 1913.",

In 1918 he worked in the \"Teatro Principal\" with the famous dancer Fernandita Areu, who at that time was considered as the first dancer in the republic.

                "Countrymen: Being the inalienable duty of every good Mexican to contribute some little effort to the prestige of our dear and beautiful country, on this date we have inaugurated musical rehearsals with the purpose of organizing a string band which will depend directly and exclusively on the Sociedad Mutualista Obreros Libres Mexicanos, and whose supervision and direction will be under my care. Therefore, I am making a call to the Mexican colony to give it an active and spontaneous cooperation, - be it a personal contribution or its moral and material aid, - in order to materialize the task we have now undertaken. In our social medium it is a necessity of great importance to seek our collective betterment, materially and intellectually as well. Taking in consideration the progressive spirit which characterizes us in the crystalization of our efforts, we feel the need of a decisive cooperation from all our racial brothers, in order to help in the reconstruction of our country's soil, that at this moment demands the aid of all its sons and the sacrifice of our personal interests, so that with fraternal harmony we may from a homogeneous group that may accomplish our final end, that is, to give our best efforts for the good of our beloved country. The rehearsals of the Tipica Obreros Libres Mexicanos will take place on Sundays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays every week, from 7:00 to 9:00 P.M., at 9011 Brandon Ave. This society cordially invites all Mexicans interested in this organization, which with in a short time will be one of the best ever had by the colony of Chicago.",

A proof of what I have said is, that the great majority of the young people who take part in the musical organizations in our colony, come from the above States. As an illustration we might refer to the Mexican Band of South Chicago, which is conducted by the able composer Professor Cirilo Rodriguez.",

When we ask why the love for music should be so deeply rooted in the people of Jalisco, Michoacan and Guanajuato, our answer is; because those people were liberated from the shameful oppression they had to endure from petty and spurious administrations as the one which culminated in the Madero's Revolution. People were then kept in the most profound ignorance and no opportunities for education were given them, For it is well known that a cultured people will exercise its civic duties and will not endure oppression or tyranny. From such an environment these people have been brought to a free country where enlightenment prevails and for that reason they are cultivating their artistic talents.",

Our astonishment is so much the greater as the band is composed of young men of about 20 years of age. The one who probably received the greatest ovation was the little cornetist who is about 13 years of age."

She is Milla Dominguez, wife of the vice-consul for Mexico in Chicago, and she will appear in joint recital with Clarita Martin, dancer, who also chose marriage in preference to a career that already had made her so well known as an exponent of old Spanish dances that she was \"commanded\"to a special performance before the former king of Spain.",

When she arrived in Chicago she could not speak a word of English \"But in three months\", she said today proudly, \"I was singing the English score of 'Hansel and Gretel' (with the American Company) without understanding one word I sang\". Now she speaks English fluently, having learned it during her stays at Washington, at New York, in Canada and now for three years, in Chicago.

Among the future plans, they have announced an annual festival, in which the principal organizations of these different nationalities residing in Chicago, have been invited. The first of said festivals took place at the Stadium, better known as \"Soldier's Field\", last Monday on a \"Labor Day\" celebration. The program consisted of twelve numbers of typical dances. Beginning with the old American dances and closing with those originated in Palestine.",

The Consulate of Mexico gave the names of the Societies 'Miguel Hidalgo' and Josef Ortiz de Dominguez'.",

These Mexican Organizations immediately began to work, and from their efforts resulted the presentation of the numbers which was best liked among the twelve which constituted the program. The three Mexican numbers were of great significance. When the name, 'Mexico' was transmitted, the audience burst out aloud and the prolonged applauses from the twenty five thousand spectators. It was a manifestation which indicated that our country is well thougt of and that our typical folklore, costumes and art is well appreciated by the sons of this country. The presentation of the Mexican numbers in the Soldier's Field, meant a great sacrifice on the part of those who organized it, because all of them are working people who have very little leisure and what little they have, would like to dedicate to rest. The artists who took part were amatuers and with scarce resources. None of them received economic renumeration. All their obstacles faded before the effort and tenacity in the preparation. It was very interesting, even though the skeptic thinks that we can not unite our efforts.",

Many of them did not have the necessary costumes but, they ordered them for this occasion, also many costumes were facilitated by the House of \"Blas Ensiso & Hijo\". The Director of the group was the sympathetic Chiquita Rangel, who sacrified a great part of per time and energy in order to train the artists exclusively to present something worthwhile in the name of Mexico Colony. The attitude of both societies \"Miguel Hidalgo of Costilla\" and Josefa Ortiz de Dominguez in accepting the responsibility was commendable and patriotic. It demonstrated that much can be done of which many of us think is possible, so as to reach the place that we as a colony deserve among the other foreign groups.",

It is our duty to respond to that affection and satisfy the inquisitiveness. Good for the \"Miguel Hidalgo\" and \"Josefa Ortiz!\" Good for Chiquita Ranguel and her sixty amatuers!"

This is what we believe happened however, we do not know whether there were any bases in the contest,or there were some bases but no contest.

The festive spirit of the Mexicans was general.",

Another lady to whom much credit is due is Mrs. Antonia Aguilar in charge of the committees,who was responsible for the artistic presentations. The \"Moraima\" act was splendid. The applause was incessant and the charming actresses were obliged to make repeated curtain calls. The Comedy \"El Suend Dorado\" was liked very much. Mr. Jose Jimenez played his role to perfection. The \"Duchess De Baltabarin\" was the climax of the entertainment. Afterwards there was dancing and it made me feel twenty years younger.",

It is well known to the colony of South Chicago the double efforts made of many of the residents of that vicinity in the organization of the program for the 16th of September.",
                "And it is due in the first place to the colony of South Chicago and secondly to the Caballeros de Guadalupe, (Knights of Guadalupe) whose institution was assigned by the colony to direct the work. One of the most important numbers in the program is the inauguration of the South Chicago Mexican Band whose members are workers of the Illinois Steel Company and other foundries in that region who, for the first time shall present to the colony the fruit of many years of labor. To make a complete history of the South Chicago Band is something that is not in our reach because we have not the complete information, nevertheless, we shall try at least to give you an idea of its beginning. Therefore, we now take the privilege of introducing the contents of a circular that was published at the inception of this organization which reads as follows.",

And thanks the great sympathy of Mr. P. A. Newton, General Superintendent of the Illinois Steel Company, and Mr. T. H. McKeeney, Manager of the same, who have offered us their valuable protection that is to give the members of this Band a preference in employment.",
                "They have given orders to the employment office to that extent, so, any person interested in the art of music may call at the Academy of Music 8751 Buffalo Avenue, South Chicago. There you may subscribe as a member, obtain all the necessary information and then we will send you to the employment office of the Illinois Steel Company. The academy is open from 9:00 A.M. until 11: P. M. and is located at the above address. South Chicago, Illinois. July 16, 1926. Signed: Gumaro Ortiz Director, Pedro Luna and E. Aragon colaborators.",
                "This copy of the circular was loaned to us by Mr. Pedro Luna who said that, at the time of its publication it was not taken into consideration that Mr. Luna and Mr. Aragon were the real organizers of the Band. Therefore, this is only an idea of the birth, the rest of its life is lost in the course of time. It is known that the members went through all kinds of experiences in their training with various teachers.",
                "The time went on and the help offered by the company was neglected some-how, perhaps because of the little or no advancement in the group. Some of the students became demoralized and suspended their studies, and others who did not went to see the dissolution of the band continued the studies.",
                "Three years ago Professor Cirilo Rodriguez through the friendship of Melesio Espinosa was brought to Gary, Indiana, where another band was being organized and thanks to the skill of Professor Rodriguez, who took the direction of the group,in nine months time the band was inaugurated. The same professor has undertaken the instruction of the Band of South Chicago, and perhaps the small progress that they have accomplished lately is due to his efforts.",

Unguestionably, the victory of some of our good artists in the movies, must influence the Spanish talking pictures considerably, so as to cause this to become a consolidated work with deserving honor for all and at the same time create a new field of development for our artists.

                "Last May, while I was in Hollywood, I had the opportunity to the premiere fim, \"One Mad Kiss,\" in which our fellow countryman Jose Mojica, a tenor appeared as a leading figure, seconded by Mona Maris and Antonio Moreno. Journalistic frankness must be accompanied with indifference to prejudice. It is for this reason that I want to be allowed to make some criticism and although it may not be in good form yet on the other hand it will be frank and well intended.",
                "\"One Mad Kiss\" is a film without an interesting plot. The Play, is nothing more than an imitation of the type like those which have made Douglas Fairbanks and other leap-dancers famous and whose action is more appropriate to a dancer than to a hero.",
                "Surely, our countryman Mojica films very well, sings better, though his acting is somewhat weak. It does not seem true, yet, our cultured artist was not sure of his part. Nevertheless, he did everything possible to sing well. In spite of the fact that he has much schooling, in the Opera there is much more to be desired and because of this fact, cannot say that this Mexican artist cannot be successful in his Motion Picture career. There are many things one can blame the vehicle picked by Fox Films, for the initial presentation of this Mexican tenor was stale. They could have easily found another plot so as to have avoided ridiculing him which as I have already stated was not his fault, for, we must understand that in the movies as well as in the theatre the directors and not the actors say what is to be done, and on this occasion they greatly compromised an excellent singer of the note of Jose Mojica.",
                "I understand that Mr. Mojica, is an accomplished Opera singer with more than eight years experience with the Chicago Civic Opera Company. His reputation is enough for him to succeed in the movies and on the stage. He photographs excellently and his personality and physical qualities are superior, his voice and schooling are of the first class and his ability as an artist is higher.",
                "All the above, makes me think that Mojica's film was taken and scheduled by exhibitors as a second class picture. It is enough to convince anyone when it is known that this film was not shown in first class theatres. This is one reason why our Spanish speaking people did not know when this picture was exhibited in the local theatres. In a large city like Chicago, with three and a half million people, one does not know what is happening a half block away. Mojica's film was classified as a second class picture and this explains why critics of the big press did not make any comment. Another feature is that the music is absolutely inattractive, although it was very well sung by our countryman Jose Mojica.",

The trill of the birds that populate our forests, the melancholy waltz which the winds compose upon the crystal keyboard of our gentle rivers, the caress of the incomparable love which our mother gave us in her loving arms, at her breast.

The Misses Navarro - what shall we say now-if spiritism were a reality, I would invoke the spirit of Calderon, de la Barca, or of Becker so they could lend me, out of their rich prose, the fortune of the song and the honey of their poetry, for these are two Panamian stars of first magnitude in the Latin Sky of Chicago.

Miss Esther Gonzales, dramatic soprano of the National Conservatory of Mexico, took charge of the program as a courtesy to this newspaper. She has shown once more her great artistic ability by surrounding herself with such reputable talent as Mrs. Milla Domingoez, Silvano R. Ramos, Francisco Tortolero and Jose Nieto. The later being an ace in the art of recitation and declamation, is demanded by our listeners, if we are to judge by the many telephone calls received asking us to have him take part next Tuesday in our program. Silvano R. Ramos, a tenor of unquestionable popularity in the colony has an excellent voice over the radio. Many persons have written to us, others have called over the telephone, all recommending us to tell Ramos to sing in all the programs. Milla Dominguez has completely revolutionized our broadcasts. Day in and day out we receive eulogies for her work in our program, Mrs. Dominguez's voice reproduces itself marvelously over the radio and is liked by all who hear it. Her songs are embellished and executed to perfection. Miss Esther Gonzalez, of the National Conservatory of Mexico, who enjoys great popularity in our colony sang very well on the night of our broadcasting. Mr. Casanova became the main feature in the program by singing \"Granadinas,\" \"Ay, Ay, Ay,\" and another song which we do not recall, all of them well executed. Of the program which Silvano Ramos is preparing for next Tuesday the 22nd, up to this moment we ignore the details. The facts we have at hand, which were made available by Ramos, are to the effect that in this program there will sing Lupe Plaza, Darwin Casanova, Silvano Ramos, and others whose names we do not know as yet. Another thing that the writer heard but to which he cannot vouch is that Jose Nieto will again recite next Tuesday. Be it what it may, anybody who has a radio should tune in at 8:45 p.m. W C F L, 970 Kilocycles, or 309 meters.",

I also wish to take advantage of this opportunity to congratulate the promoters and managers of these weekly broadcasts for the interest they have taken not only to acquaint those in this country with the sweetness and beauty of our music, but for the plan very fitting indeed of binding more closely the relations which ought to exist among those Spanish speaking countries.

At the hour here indicated, a few moments before the plates began to be served, the writer of these lines made the presentation of the Mexican Consul Senor Carlos Palacios Roji, the Vice-Consul Senor Tomas Morlet, Prof. F. Ortiga Rodriguez, and other gentlemen who were specially invited to this popular dinner. Having no other object in mind except to bring together periodically the representative elements of our colony and to bring closer relations of friendship and nationalism which must necessarily be impulsed in the Mexican family outside of Mexico.",
                "The Mexican Consul, the Vice-Consul and Professor Rodriguez took the floor, stressing the necessity of unity and fraternity among the various elements in our  colony. All the guests, very frankly were in favor of the continuation of this kind of reunion. The menu however was very rich, consisting of \"Mole Poblano\", tacos, tostadas, enchiladas frijoles, guayaba desert and Mexican cheese. For drinking, there were beer and coffee. The dishes were very well prepared and the guess praised the cook for her skill in the culinary art. The following persons were present at the dinner, Senor Carlos Carlos Palacios Roji, Tomas Morlet, Consul and Vice-Consul of Mexico, Prof. Fortunato Ortega Rodriguez, Salvador Alaniz, Santiago Samora, Dr. Eluid Garcia Trevino, E.

                "The next dinner will be held during the last week of September and is dedicated to the Mexican Societies of Chicago, each group must send at least three delegates. We are making preparations to that extent and will send the invitations on time. We beg all our friends to pardon us for not sending them invitations, but it was due to the limited capacity of the place where the dinner was to be served. From Indiana Harbor we received several letters from some of our country-men who wanted to come to our dinner, but unfortunately could not attend due to brevity of time."

                "Father S. Savoldi, Mr. Jose O. Velasco, Antonio Acosta, Jose Fernandez, and many other persons representing social and religious organizations, are very courteously invited to the next conference to be held by this committee in the near future. The main purpose of this campaign is to combat this serious disease, which, according to statistics, has caused considerable suffering among our nationals. In order to prevent its propagation, we must give the public sound and valuable advice on how to be protected against it. Dr. Benjamin Goldberg, director of the Municipal Tuberculosis Sanitarium of Chicago, with the cooperation of Mr. Rafael Aveleira, consul of Mexico in Chicago, intends to begin a real campaign against the spread of the disease which is gaining ground in an alarming proportion, according to the statistics of the Sanitarium. This educational campaign,--as was said in our edition of last Saturday,--shall consist of lectures, illustrated with films, by the Chicago Health Department. The increase of tubercular cases, so sharp in 1928, was counteracted in 1929 thanks to the campaign so effectively undertaken by the Health Department. Tuberculosis is easier to avoid than to cure, and its prevention depends largely on the public's ability to notice the first symptoms so as to go to a clinic for an examination before the infection sets its roots in the organism, that is, if the infection really exists. This is the aim pursued by Dr. Goldberg. The cooperation of the people is necessary, if we are to reduce the disease to a minimum. The Health Department maintains a board of medical experts and excellent clinics provided with the best advancements of science, where examination is free to any person who may have the symptoms or any indication of tuberculosis."

                "It is already of the public's knowledge, through leaflets and posters now circulating in the colony, that the Cruz Azul Mexicana (Mexican Blue Cross) at the present time is busy in the organization of a great concert and dance, intended to commemorate the glorious 5th of May. The affair will take place at the Ashland Auditorium, May 4th at 7 P. M. To judge by the enormous enthusiasm which now reigns among the colony, this festival promises to be a colossal event. It counts on the support of the Mexican Consulate and many of the Mexican societies of Chicago, which on this occasion have united in order to give more splendor to this festival in commemoration of one of the most glorious days in the history of Mexico."

                "Honorable Board of Directors:",
                "With due consideration I beg to call your attention to an article which appeared in the newspaper Mexico, on Apr. 5th, signed by Narciso Gonzalez, of South Chicago, entitled \"El Problema de la Cruz Azul Mexicana\" (The problem of the Mexican Blue Cross). As for myself, although I have ceased to be a member of your Directive Body, I have a great interest and enthusiasm for the Mexican Blue Cross, and the article here mentioned is very significant for these reasons; (1) The article, written in a conscientious and spontaneous manner, has come from our modest working class, the main element of our Mexican colony in South Chicago. Through it a call is made to the Mexican colony to give their contributions and entire support to the Cruz Azul Mexicana. (2) The writer, as I said before, belongs to the working class; he knows perfectly well what the needs are because he is in close contact with both the existing misery and prosperity in the Mexican colony of South Chicago. It is for this reason that he is authorized to speak on the matter the way he did. And, lastly, the article in question is highly significant because, having been written by a humble person,--a laborer,--it simply shows the interest that exists among the Mexican working class element of South Chicago as regards the Mexican Blue Cross. It further shows that the South Chicago territory should be a very favorable and fertile camp for the activities and development of this beneficent and noble institution; favorable, because of its large Mexican colony, among which funds could be raised to maintain this aid society.",
                "Unfortunately, the geographic location of South Chicago in regard to the center of activities of the Mexican Blue Cross makes it difficult to extend such activities into that territory, due to the enormous distances the nurses of this institution would have to cover to investigate cases, and visit the sick, etc. The article goes on to say that the colony of South Chicago needs the Mexican Blue Cross, that the Mexican Blue Cross needs the cooperation of all the Mexican colony, and that it is imperative to take up some measure in order to correct the deficiency that now exists due to the difficulties above mentioned. That the S. Chicago colony has received little attention is self-evident to any observer who, as myself, has had the opportunity to know and be in close contact with the needs of our colony there. How many times, while discharging my medical duty, have I seen families in misfortune, not only unable to pay the doctor's fee or buy medicines, but unable to buy their daily bread. And, in spite of that I have chosen not to call upon the Cruz Azul Mexicana to solicit aid for these needy people, because I understand perfectly well that due to the distance, cases could not be attended with the required efficiency. How many times have I preferred in such cases to extend my services to them free of charge, giving them medicines, etc. Taking into consideration the aforesaid, with the utmost respect, I beg the Honorable Board of Directors of the Cruz Azul Mexicana to please take up in the next session the following motions which I wish to submit merely as a Mexican: (1) To establish a Sub-Brigade or a Delegation in South Chicago, (2) That such Brigade, or Delegation, be a subordinate to the Brigade of Chicago, (3) That the Sub-Brigade of the Cruz Azul Mexicana be granted an autonomy, that is to say, that it be free to take the initiative and to decide upon any problem that might arise, such as carrying out the work of charity as it may judge pertinent, organizing festivals in order to raise funds, etc., always in common agreement and with the cooperation of the Cruz Azul Mexicana of Chicago, (4) That the Sub-Brigade of the Cruz Azul Mexicana of South Chicago shall consist of a directing body elected by the Mexican colony of South Chicago in a mass meeting, so that it be composed of persons residing in South Chicago, who are familiar with the needs of that colony, (5) That on decisions concerning the management of funds, said Sub-Brigade be instructed by the Honorable Board of Directors. Having not the least doubt that this Honorable Board will give due consideration to my motions and accord them their support, since they have an altruistic aim, I remain with the utmost respect,",

Since its inception up to this day, this organization has gone through a series of difficulties, because of lack of elements in their ranks who possess financial resources. Although the personnel which composes this society is very competent, they cannot make a front to all the obligations that the institution in itself demands. Because, as I pointed it out before; they need the financial cooperation of the Mexican merchants and the colony in general.",
                "The doctors, nurses, persons visiting the sick, the president and finally the entire personnel receive no salary, their purpose being to aid our countrymen in distress. But, what can the members of this society do without money? Is it possible to solve all the problems that may arise, with good-will alone? No, because in cases like this, good-will is not enough, for we are living in a world in which money is the support of life.",
                "And, money is the problem with which a charitable organization is confronted with, and it would be a gross absurdity to think that with good-will alone everything can be done. Especially in these cases the 'will,' demands a prompt appearing of funds on the contrary any aim on this direction will be shattered to pieces upon the stone of failure. The question of raising funds for the support of this society has been carefully studied, and it has come to the conclusion that this can only be done through the organization of festivals, whether these be recreational or in commemoration of the struggle and deeds of our Mexican heroes. Only in this manner can such work be carried out effectively. The idea is very good, magnificent, but, I would add to this, that it is the inevitable duty of all of the Mexican Colony in Chicago and vicinity to contribute freely with its share every time they are solicited.",
                "Since it is the duty of every good Mexican, to be vigiland over those of our countrymen who are dispossessed and wandering through the streets, nearly begging some bread, not for them, but for their children who cry because of a lack of food, without shelter, or in bed sick, fighting between life and death without any protection or resource than the aid of our charitable institution.",
                "Let us not forget; all the Mexicans who today enjoy a partial security, that perhaps tomorrow or a day after they may be in their ranks, begging some bread for our children due to unemployment. Then we will have to resort to the above mentioned society and it in gratitude may open the door and give help. Members of this society, must bear in mind that the aggrandizement of the work which they have decided to carry on, depends upon the fulfillment of the sacred duty. that they of their own volition have imposed upon themselves."

Her husband deserted her and her four children, two of whom are sick in the hospital. The afflicted mother is engaged in a life and death battle with her misfortunes.

We wish to congratulate the Sociedad Femenil Mexicana for this humanitarian deed and it is our belief that the Mexicans and Spanish-Americans will give their share be it small or large to a desolate mother whose sole resources are those given to her by a kind public. A good example has been set by the Sociedad Femenil-Mexicana. As soon as the society heard that there was no money to bury the boy its members decided to meet and to find out what they could do to help a grieving mother. It is up to the Mexican colony, or rather to all those who speak Spanish to show once more that they are really united and hospitable.

                "I had the honor of being the director of propaganda of the worthy Cruz Azul Mexicana which failed and of which at that time Mrs. Refugio Alaniz was president. As at that time no other charitable society was in existence, the no less respectable Sociedad Femenil Mexicana was organized under the leadership of Mrs. Barron. Instead of speaking of union and solidarity, would it not be better to lend complete support, to the Sociedad Femenil Mexicana? Our financial support is the one mostly needed. If we spend one and two dollars for little festivals which only deprive us of sleep, why can't we attend instead the festivals organized by the Femenil Mexicana? In that case more Mexicans would attend the entertainments organized by those charitable women who in many instances put aside their domestic duties in order to give aid to our children, widows and unemployed. By coming to their affairs we improve the financial condition of this benevolent institution. Thus we would not only help financially, but at the same time build up a Mexican institution devoted to charity which would be economically sound.",
                "Why should we want a Mexican center which might become a center for gossip and breed jeolousies, because Mr. so-and-so was not elected president or secretary and wanted his name to appear in print?",
                "On the other hand, if we help an institution of charity whether this be the Sociedad Femenil Mexicana or a similar one, we are promoting the formation of good Mexicans, and the education of our helpless children who fortunately or unfortunately speak the English language much better that their own beautiful Spanish. With sufficient funds, we could afford to pay an instructor to teach the Spanish language and Mexicanism as well, not only to our children but also to us adults who need it so much. If on the other hand a Mexican Center is formed, the past shows us how unsuccessful we have been in such undertakings. Having formed such a center, we would have to keep away from groups that indulge in dancing and similar frivolities.",
                "Two real festivals a year having as object to help the charitable and cultural institutions would be sufficient. There are now one or two groups which have an athletic or social purpose. In the main they devote themselves to dancing and little week-end parties, without any other purpose than to provide a good time for a group of conceited youngsters. Their dances are immoral to their contortions ridiculous and the flappers whom the young men escort have a very doubtful reputation.",
                "The presence of these young people keeps our decent families away from those places to which all of us would come should order, morality and good manners prevail.",
                "Let us be contented and help the only charitable institution that we have, the Sociedad Femenil Mexicana, let us give it our complete moral and material support. The society above mentioned within a few days will give an entertainment for the children, let us help them, and forget the \"editoriales.\"",

It is on that day when we get ready to make the children happier, through obtaining better medicines for their health. Do we by any chance remember the more than one million children, between the ages of 10 and 15 who are employed by industry? What a misfortune, that the work and youth have to be associated together! These are among the less privileged and must receive special consideration. This question may be considered from many angles.",
                "These children must have the right nourishment, appropriate clothing, sufficient hours of sleep, and physical examinations to discover those defects susceptible to correction, these things must be done every year. One must insist that the factory or the place where they are employed should not expose them to danger and should allow them the time and place to play. Even after these problems are being solved, we must be sure that the seclusion necessitated by their work and the duties other imposed upon them, do not diminish their vital strength, nor injure their health in general; this would make them physically incapable in their future life. It is the duty of the community to facilitate the work in all its' phases so that the child who works may have sufficient hours of rest and play. Children who have this responsibility must play enough and this should be done under close supervision and guidance.",

Are we trying to give them an opportunity in life, equal to that possessed by those with a higher social rank? Will they through our efforts derive a favorable idea of the justice of our nation for its less privileged class."

                "This pamphlet is based upon information gathered by Robert C. Jones in a survey of the Mexicans in Chicago during the years 1928-1931. The survey was carried out under the direction of United Religious Survey of Protestantism in Chicago and presented to a Sub-Committee of the Comity Commission of the Chicago Church Federation. This Committee recommended the publication of a pamphlet based on the findings of this survey and appointed an Editorial Committee to assume charge of the publication, consisting of M. N. English, R. H. Elliott, S. C. Kincheloe, Victor E. Marriott. Through the open windows of a second-story room opposite Hull House on a mid-summer Saturday evening come the jazz strains of a gospel hymn being lustily sung in Spanish. If we were to trace this music to its source it would lead us into the midst of a revival meeting of the Pentecostals. There in a crowded room we would find a Mexican Evangelist, eyes shining and face flushed by his enthusiasm, leading the singing, while an orchestra made up of a cornet, two drums, three triangles, and a piano beats out the rhythm with a will. But we do not wish to loiter long within its doors. There are other interesting things to be seen along South Halsted during this twilight hour. The strange Spanish signs upon the shop windows put us in the mood for exploration and we turn our steps southward along the Mexican Boulevard. First we pass a restaurant whose brilliant painted walls are covered by designs reminiscent of that Indian culture which Cortez and his followers so ruthlessly destroyed in their conquest of Mexico. In the next block we pause before the window of a music store and glance at the display of ukeleles, guitars, violins, and wind instruments. This little shop makes phonographic records of music as played and sung by Chicago's finest Spanish-speaking artists. And from here the records may find their way to the portable phonographs in the boxcar homes of Mexican railroad workers all over the United States, or even in the little far-away shacks which house the migratory laborers in the sugar-beet fields.",
                "Across the street a Mexican woman of middle age, straight black hair caught up in a knot at the back of her head, modestly garbed in a long brown skirt and green silk waist, stands beside her husband. They are looking at the primitive metates in the window of a grocery store - those crude ironing boards with their stone rollers for crushing the water soaked kernel of corn into the paste from which the Mexican bakes his thin cakes of unleavened bread, his tortillas. The woman is evidently considering a purchase. A well dressed young Mexican man passes by, escorting a Mexican girl who is smartly attired in the most modern fashion. They are probably on their way to a dance of the Aztec Club in Bowen Hall at Hull House. The older woman gazes after them in stern disapproval. Then she shakes her head. Such an immodest dress for a girl to wear in public! And to think of any young girl being out on the streets alone with herlover! Such things are never done in Mexico! The young man and woman are passing on up the street. As they go by a pool hall several other young Mexicans watch them enviously. Rubio always was a lucky dog! And to get such a pretty girl.",
                "The largest part of the Mexican immigration has been made up of single men or of men who have left their families in Mexico. This makes competition for the women very keen among the young men. However, the Mexican is such a graceful dancer that he can often overcome the barriers of difference and secure a partner from among other nationalities. Miss Anita Edgar Jones has even found some Mexicans taking wives among the Norwegian, the Polish, and the German girls.",
                "Out on the street the fortunate Rubio and his companion are pausing before the window of a Jewish clothing merchant to admire the splendidly attired wax figures of a bride and groom. The Mexican temperament loves the color and gayety of any festive occasion - especially of a wedding. And these two are young and in love. But this is not the story of Rubio. Let us return and step inside the pool hall.",
                "The Mexican pool hall, of which there are more than fifty in Chicago, is quite as much patronized as a social center, news dispensing agency, and mutual aid society as for its more obvious purposes.",
                "And although the Mexican is growing to do more business with the banks which are located in the immediate neighborhood of the colony, the proprietor of the pool hall remains one of his most trusted bankers. Here the newcomer to Chicago can most easily fraternize with his follow country-men; be informed of the ways of the city; secure such small, friendly loans as he may at first need; inquire about the best way to find work; and later leave with the proprietor for safekeeping such amounts from his weekly wages as he may be fearful of carring upon his person or of leaving in his room in the cheap lodging house where he stays. But let us end our leisure walk down Halsted now and complete our survey of this largest of Chicago's Mexican Colonies by swifter method of general description.",
                "The colony centers around Halsted between Harrison and 15th Street. That is to say, it is located in the near West Side, a locality which has been receiving newly-arrived immigrants for the past half century and also, though scarcely by accident, a community which has some of the poorest housing in the city.",
                "Here where rents are cheap, where employment agencies are near at hand, and where numerous industrial plants are within easy reach, is a natural place for the immigrant to begin his life in Chicago. As the successive waves of immigrants have come into the city they have always settled in such communities and then pushed outward to occupy better residential districts as their economic status has improved. As newest arrivals in the immigrant flood the Mexicans are found living in the poorest quarters in the city. The Mexicans of this colony, however, though numbering between seven and eight thousand, do not wholly fill the districts.",
                "Between Harrison and Polk Streets and especially on Halsted and Blue Island, the Mexicans are in the midst of a Greek settlement. Between Polk and Roosevelt Road there is a heavy concentration of Italians west of Halsted and of Poles to the east. North of Roosevelt Road a great many Jews and Russians are to be found. Along Halsted Street the north and south traffic jostles and bumps and clangs its way. Maxwell resounds with the din made by the vender on the curb market as they scream their strangely assorted wares and haggle over a difference of a few pennies on a sale. Up and down the treeless back streets dilapidated two and three-story houses elbow each other for room and struggle to give shelter to many families who overcrowd their interior.",
                "On week days the Old Town Boys' Club of Newberry Avenue reaches out to serve more then two hundred Mexican Boys. Firenne House on Gilpen Place has its clubs for Mexican Mothers and their little daughters.",
                "The Infant Welfare Society with headquarters at Hull House labors to teach the mothers of the neighborhood how to overcome the rickets-producing effects of the smoke-dimmed daylight. And Hull House itself opens its classes to hundreds of Mexican students. There they are to be found in the pottery shop, the studio, the musical organizations, the dramatic association, the English classes, and the Social groups.",
                "The members of St. Mark's Presbyterian-Congregational Church hold their Sunday School and worship at 1213 Gilpen Place. The Methodist have a Church at Polk and Sholto and the Baptist at Monroe and Morgan.",
                "In addition there are a number of other missions of the Seventh Day Adventist, Pentecostal and other sects. But at the Church St. Francis on Roosevelt Road the predominant Catholic background of these immigrants reveals itself. There at special Mass conducted for the Mexicans nearly a thousand worshippers often kneel and are comforted by the beauty and upreach of the prayers offered in the universal language of the Church of Rome. There at a shrine at one side of the church their own national patron saint, Our Lady of Guadalupe, gazes upon them. From there they go out after the miracle of the Mass has been consummated, assured once more of their soul's salvation. Such, in brief outward view, is the picture of Chicago's largest and perhaps oldest Mexican colony in the city.",
                "Reference to the map on the opposite page will reveal at a glance where the chief Mexican colonies are located. The two most important areas in addition to the one already described, are the Stock Yards district and the So. Chicago area. In the Stock Yards district there are three distinct colonies, the largest of which is concentrated around Ashland avenue and Forty-six Street.",
                "The University of Chicago Settlement has served as a center for the Mexicans in this community for a number of years. The Settlement has employed a part-time Spanish-speaking worker and several Mexican Societies have had headquarters there. This group is employed mainly in the Stock Yards. The smaller groups to the south and east of the Yards find employment with the several packing houses, the American Can Company and the railroads."

Strong words continued for few minutes, at the end of which, Federico asked his wife to a bed room where they could speak with more liberty. Aurora agreed to the suggestion. Mrs. Rodriguez and the other occupants of the house suddenly heard Aurora screaming desperately and hurried to the room, but just before they got to the room they heard three detonations. When they opened the door Aurora was found on the floor mortally wounded.",

While being arrested he showed no resistance. When he was interrogated at the Police Station Chavez said that he suspected infidelity of his wife and that his suspicion increased greatly by the act of his wife when she took the marriage certificate away from home.",

While in jail, Ramirez suffered an attack of pneumonia, and died. The Immigration Department, estimated Ramirez's case to cost the State about $700.00 besides the oxygen administered during his illness, which cost about $34.00 a day.

He had been attracted to this city by an advertisement which he saw in his homeland and which offered a course in aviation. It was his idea to study it so that he might secure a license to fly and then return to his native land to serve his country. Once here he made inquiry as to merits of the school which had advertised in his homeland. He learned that the school had an extremely bad reputation. Thereupon the young man decided not to enter this school. It was then that he met Captain Venegas, who was giving private lessons on the theory and practice of aviation. Young Dezas' interest was aroused to the point where he decided to take the courses offered by Captain Venegas.",
                "He paid the Captain one hundred and fifty dollars for the theory course of flying lessons which were given in groups for a period of several weeks. At this time the Captain conducted the classes at 1826 South Michigan Avenue, where young Dezas lived together with Enrique Moncayo and Libardo Rodriguez, both also from Colombia.",

In the meantime only one of the students was financially able to make arrangements to pursue the practical end of the study, and this student was Benigno A. Dezas.",
                "On the 21st of last March young Dezas gave two hundred and seventy five dollars to instructor Venegas as his contribution toward the purchase of a plane to be used in taking flying lessons. Captain Venegas had told his pupil that he already had obtained money from two Mexican and one American students which together with his and that of Dezas' would be sufficient to obtain the flying machine.",
                "The young man was pleased with this arrangement and in the presence of one of the students, Enrique Moncayo, Captain Venegas gave him a receipt which indicated that the money was to be used for the purchase of a plane.",

The shooting occurred when the policeman, dressed in plain clothes, attempted to question three Mexicans who were passing by.",
                "Those apprehended were, Max Garcia, 27 years old, 3040 E. 22nd St., accused of being the murderer; Jose Garcia, 26 years of age, of the same address, but not related to Max, and Alfonso Reyes, 29 years old, 8425 Mackinaw Ave.",
                "Max Garcia was seized by officer Daniel Collins, partner of Szewcyzk, shortly after the shooting. The others, Jose Garcia, and Alfonso, were apprehended and held as material witnesses in the case of the accused.",
                "Collins, in making a report of the case, said that he and the victim were making a round thru Buffalo Ave. when they encountered a group of three individuals who looked suspicious. When he and Szewcyzk went up to question them, one drew a pistol and opened fire on Szewcyzk, who fell mortally wounded. The trio immediately fled, two of the men running south in Buffalo Ave. and Max Garcia fleeing north. It was then that Collins ran after Max Garcia, shooting at him as he ran, and trying to protect himself from the bullets of the fugitive, who escaped.",
                "Garcia was finally overtaken in 88 St. and arrested. He still held the pistol in his hand.",

Chicago Ave., and Mr. and Mrs. Andrew Anaszewickz, 8837 Buffalo Ave., witnessed the cross-fire and were the ones who took the wounded policeman to the Illinois Steel Company's Hospital, where Szewczyk died a few moments after his arrival. The murdered officer lived at 9332 Colfax Ave. with his wife, Anna, and their five-year-old daughter, Angelina. His body was taken to the Walkowiak mortuary, 8803 Commercial Ave.",
                "At present the investigators are trying to disclose what led the accused to commit his crime, and whether it is certain that he shot the officer without the latter having given Max a cause to do so. Collins reported that there was no cause for the crime.",
                "Szewcyzk was dressed in civilian clothes when he approached Max Garcia and his two companions, and it could have well been suspected that Garcia might have felt that he was about to be a victim of a hold-up. As to the facts of this, we are not sure, because it was not possible for us to talk to the accused."

It occurred just a few days ago when Jose A. Duran, of 40 S. Halsted street, swindled over two hundred Mexicans on the pretense of sending them to work. He has mysteriously disappeared from his temporary employment office at 40 S. Halsted street.",
                "His confidence game consisted in collecting money from Mexicans seeking for work at the agency. In order to make the victims gobble the pill so artfully prepared, he distributed some attractive literature among the Mexicans. Among other things the place where these workers were supposed to report for work was at the Navy Yard of Cleveland, Ohio, where all kinds of work could be had. Of course those who didn't want to do labor could be used as electricians or mechanics. Five dollars a day was the minimum wage. Considering the lack of work that prevails at this time in this city, Duran's appeal must have had a good response. The literature in question offered a good job with free transportation, furnished rooms, stoves, coal, light, clean bedding, and dishes, all guaranteed for six months. The days for registering were from Oct. 15th to 22nd, and the day of departure for Cleveland, Oct. 25th. On October 20th Duran disappeared. The departure for Cleveland was quite a joke that has been felt by more than two hundred Mexicans. When they came to the depot they were told that the Mr. Deming who signed the literature was absolutely unknown. When the workers had convinced themselves of the truth they went to the Desplaines Police Station to lodge a complaint. The police promised to do everything possible to find Joe Duran, alias A. B. Deming.",
                "Jose Duran is married to a girl from Argentine and it is said he was in financial straits. It is believed that in order to avoid suspicion for his disappearance, he suspended the enlistment of workers the day he left, telling those who asked to go to Cleveland that all the vacancies had been filled. It is estimated that Duran collected about $3,000. Many people paid him $15, $10, and $5. Some not only paid their fee, but also paid for those who were penniless. No one suspected the insolvency of Duran and everyone had faith in him. The swindle was cunningly planned. The date to carry it out was precisely at the time when hundreds of Mexicans converge into the city in preparation for the winter season. Duran knew that this was the time when most of the workers had received their half month salary and was the only time in which his project could bring results."

Ladra Spanish born, and a former student at the University of Indiana, is the proprietor. Senor Ladra, affectionately known as \"Tony\" is a man of parts. He is an authority on bull-fighting and manufactures his own \"banderillas\" for decorating purposes only. He imports the barks from Spain.",
                "Over Tony's door hangs the fighting cape of his friend, Ortega, the highest paid torero, or bull fighter, in the world. If you are fortunate to be in Tony's for supper some night when Luis Catarelo, known in the bull-ring as \"Silveti Chico\", and Alfredo Velasco are there you will see an interesting exhibition of a mock bull-fight.",

Herlinda Rodriguez, a former actress of Mexico City, will become so excited that she will cry, \"Banderilla el toro\"! She wants the banderillas placed in the toro Velasco's neck, and Catarelo will oblige- by waving the banderillas. Both of these toreros have fought in various American exhibitions of bull-fighting and will tell you that it is more dangerous than fighting against bulls in Mexico or Spain. Each has received several cornadas, or horn wounds, from bulls who had all the advantage.",
                "Because in this country the bullfighter can not even slap the bull, but the bull can gore the fighter. They will tell you this work is \"muy malo\". After the \"bull fight\" and while you are eating your tacos in Tony's - a dish for which he is famed you may witness \"El Jarabe Tapatio\" or the Mexican Hat Dance, if Senorita Herlinda Rodriguez gets excited over the singing of \"La Cucaracha\" which you can rest assured she will. She will toss a sombrero on the floor and dance around the rim as girls in Mexico. After you have heard it once you will start humming it. And after you have heard it several times you will sing it in your sleep. The song which has many verses as our own \"Frankie and Johnnie\", is about a quarter of a century old in Mexico. But it is generally known as \"Pancho Villa's theme song\". Villa's soldiers marched to this tune and they made up many verses to disconcert the Carranzistas. Notably among these verses is the one where they were going to weave a hat band from the whiskers of Carranza to place about the sombrero of \"Valiente Pancho Villa.\" Other verses can't even be hinted at.",

This office wholly adheres to the proposition made by the author of the article because of its great transcendence to the Mexican people and because some day we shall demonstrate to foreign countries that we know how to be united and form part of the civilized communities to which we have a right to belong. Ignacio Valle says: \"The fact is amply known to the public that the Mexican Band of Chicago has firmly maintained its principles with abnegation and patriotism in the midst of vicissitudes, because \"art\" is the supreme vehicle of patriotism among all civilized peoples. Everyone of  knows perfectly well that the whole artistic personnel of this band is entirely formed by Mexican workers who, even though being worn out by their daily tasks devote three hours of their spare time in order to .  In short, theirs is the task of a just and honest . work of when I say, \"our band\" it  not only in Chicago but  as well. In the many concerts they have given in Chicago and in many cities in the states of Michigan and Indiana, they were warmly greeted, having  clamorous success in Detroit, where they were heard by our own people and strangers as well. It is only just that we should compensate the work done by the young people composing this musical organization that has honored us; it is just that we bring forth our contributions; it is just also to show them our appreciation with something, even if it is a small thing, so that the  of this philharmonic group can materialize their efforts.  on a very small scale I would propose to my countrymen in business to contribute with a fixed amount every month, intended to . A small monthly fee  country-men would be of great fraternal significance for our young musicians. \n   of Chicago established the components of this young organization would put more courage and could work with more energy; they would improve more and more in their studies; they would see that the Mexican  appreciates their work. Then, the citizens of this noble, cultured and hospitable country would be convinced that we are lovers of art; that we cultivate music, literature, painting, and , that we know how to take part in the concert of progressive and cultured peoples and above all, that we know how to help each other  foment the advancement of youth initiating itself in a life of music. With a little concerted effort the Mexican merchants of Chicago we could do much, because it takes but one brick to finish a building. We do not have to cement this building; all that we have to do is to give the finishing touch to put the last brick or stone and the glorious building, which forms the Mexican band of Chicago will be terminated. I hope that this idea will find approval among my fellow-businessmen, and in the hearts of all good Mexicans in general.\"",

It is concerning something different, and to begin with, there will not be any directing body or fixed dues, neither will be excluded from its program those topics which are omitted by other groups. This society has been already formed.",
                "Dear reader, don't shrink your shoulders, or sceptically say that this is nothing new to hear of a new group being organized in the bosom of our colony. It would be news if we could hear that something good had been done by some of our existing groups. No dances or banquets which only serve to puffed up with pride, but something worthy of being proud of, something that can show that we are useful, not only good to eat and dance. It is dealt now with a society that will not exploit the impetus, nor our feelings, a society that may help us to live better, amplifying our horizon and indicating the most propitious path during our transition on earth.",
                "There would not be any object in organizing a group to be the same as the others just for the simple pleasure of one being called an organizer knowing perfectly well that this group could get nowhere, nor could accomplish anything, were we to follow the same pathway of those that have been a failure. The organizers of the Anahuac Club before they decided to act upon, they considered the possibility of joining some of the other groups in order to avoid the formulation of a program for a new one. But, after thinking it over and after a conscientious study, they arrived at the conclusion which gave origin to the formation of the \"Club Anahuac\". They prefer to start at the bottom to point out the way that must be followed in the development of this work without having to wait for the approval of an assembly who never approves innovated measures. The degeneration of our youth is shamefully, and one can hardly believe the state of ignorance in which the majority of our countrymen are to be found.",
                "All the societies that have existed until now, have left this point completely untouched, the majority are more preoccupied in things that shine, without stopping one moment to see whether their work is constructive or ridiculous. This is to cover their appearance which have been their high hill, They have not realized that one can't get very far when he presents a false front. All this and more has been considered by the organizers of the Anahuac Club, and on these bases the program of this Club has been formulated. This Club shall not have rules or by-laws to violate, neither has stipulated any dues.",
                "Ours will not be a parliamentary discussion, but we can speak of everything that concerns human life, that is, everything that is discussable. Conferences and debates will be the best forms to be used in ventilating our problems. Absolute freedom of thought will be the motto at every meeting. Each person will have his own place, the place he may be capable to conquer. As you may already see, the constitution of the Anahuac Club, and its program makes this a different organization.",
                "As far as the objective is concerned, it cannot be any better. The purpose now is to develop the various elements among our people and expect from it the betterment of our colony, a real improvement and not an apparent one. We must pursue on the route to defeat the worst enemy of the people, \"ignorance\". Let us see to it, that all whose who may come in contact with our group open their eyes and look at things from the more superior planes, from the point of view of a man that is free.",
                "In conclusion the \"Ahahuac\" wants to progress for all. Should the reader wish to affiliate with the \"Anahuac\" all that he has to do is to come in person to 1139 South Ashland Avenue. Remember that you need no money, the \"Club Anahuac\" has no treasurer because we do not want to accumulate funds that may provoke greedy people."

A reunion has taken place, the main object was a banquet, but no one suspected the outcome. Most of the guests spoke without making the least effort to find a particular topic. In the meantime a subject was brought foward, although it was an old one, whenever it is on discussion it provokes a heated debate. And it compromises those who tackle it especially if they are representatives of social groups, who are ready to undertake their part justly. Those present at the reunion were mostly members of the Alianza Fraternal Mexicana who in adapting the most appropriate method, as societies usually do, to meet periodically in a place where no formality is demanded with the purpose to intimate their friendship and prepare themselves for the social activities in harmony with the needs of their group.",
                "Those who have some experience in directing societies approve this sort of reunions because they have come to realize that in such a manner, they will get to know their members better when they express their feelings without the selection of terms for their speech as it occurs at the meeting hall. After finishing the fancy food, which was accompanied with beer, that is, when I happen to come into the place. Then the discourses began and turned out to be very compromising though apparently did not seem, but, automatically they were obliged to initiate the work pertaining to the confederation of the Mexican societies of Chicago, a task that these societies pursued without any results.",
                "The president of La Alianza Sr. Jesus Maldonade, in answering to the exhortation of this writer, he said that he would do all that was in his power to carry out the consumation of the work on unification which until this date, has been one of the major problems in our colony. Sr. Maldonado said, that he was sure to count upon the support of the members of La Alianza for such objective, and I believed he is right, if the other members who approved the presidents view spoke with sincerity.",
                "For my part, I sincerely wish that something good may come out and what was said Friday night at the banquet, be not merely an inspiration of the beer. No one can deny the urgent need for the Mexican colony to be justly represented. And if that representation cannot be obtained through the social groups, I can not see a more adequate form. Certainly this is difficult for we know that many of our social leaders do nothing gratis and others accept nothing except a place in office to dominate others.",

It is not possible to wait any longer, because the duty is urging us to move forward.

Many look at me with suspicion because they say that my name is not a Mexican one, without seeing that my work is so. For instance I have always excluded myself from receiving favors from American Institutions. I have never accepted anything free, not even a hall to hold my meetings, therefore, I have always had my own hall, so as not to be depending upon the \"Yankees\". Not because I detest them, but because I feel that so long as I owe them no favors, I could'nt be indebted to them in anyway, consequently, I can consider myself independent and free.",

These young Mexicans who are studying aviation in this country are doing it with a view of returning to the Mother Country qualified and ready to serve her in whatever manner they may be able.",

H. A., Alianza Hispano-Americana. Reading the false statements contained therein, people not acquainted with Mr. Santiagosa or his work in favor of Mexico may think that these reports were prompted by jealousy or bad faith. The article is signed by Mexicans who do not know the injustice of their assertions. It is impossible to explain for instance, how his work could be considered anti-Mexican.",
                "Mr. Santiagosa, as a worthy ex-president of this Lodge is supported by thousands of Mexicans belonging to almost two hundred and fifty Lodges in Mexico and in the United States. Often he has given all the proceeds of his dramatic plays to Mexican societies and families. In his repertoire he has some plays by Mexican authors such as Manuel Mayo whose play was copyrighted by Mr. Santiagosa. He uses Mexican actors and has greatly contributed to the organization of patriotic celebrations. At the present time he is lending his cooperation to a Mexican exposition which will take place in the United States. We could mention many other points but our purpose is not to praise the gentleman, Mr. Santiagosa. We simply want to inform the Mexicans who do not know him that he is worthy of the esteem of all the Mexicans and that El Humo with its poisonous pen cannot tarnish his clean record. Although the sheet referred to criticized the artistic work of the Arte Musical, we do not wish to discuss this point now. We all know that persons who lack good taste are unable to appreciate goods of fine material. Our Lodge very much regrets that the Mexican Gazette of Detroit, Michigan, which ought to give an example of dignity should select such an able person for the topic of its column, \"Fairy Tales.\" Large societies with branches all over the world have supported and honored Mr. Santiagosa. It is a pity that the defamation of an honest person should give pleasure to some people.",

This feminine society deserves all the support of the Mexican colony. Its existence is necessary for the welfare of the children, besides being worthy of the Mexican woman.",

Another attraction is the exhibition of paintings at the termination of the dance. At this exhibition there will be an opportunity to obtain a precious piece of work at a very low price and with the assurance that the money paid for it, will be used for a very deserving and humanitarian cause: to aid the Mexican children. Mexico from its columns, calls its readers to cooperate in one from or another to the aggrandizement of this society who with so much ardor is working for the interest of the Mexican. With such groups as the Sociedad Femenil Mexicana, the colony is destined to progress."

The experience advises us on this occasion to comply with out duty, that is, to honor the memory of our heroes, in a loyal and respectful manner and not within that feeble concept of patriotism which is converted into verbosity which for many long years has prevailed in the spirit of our oldest sisters. To such, instead of calling it a manifestation of gratitude to our heroes; we can just as well call it manifestation of tolerance and inculture. Then, year after year, instead of us seeing the Mexican groups of Chicago as the real patriotic flower, we have been able to contemplate only the darnel of a false patriotism.",

Because, always a number of individuals will crowd around, and whose interests are linked to a personal profit; finding therefore, in our national days, a good pretext to satiate all their passions and cupidity.",

We must bear in mind that the country belongs to all, and is there for all; for this reason only, we shall celebrate the 5th of May wherever the majority so desire, but, without any charge.

Many of our countrymen are only waiting for such national days to procure a profit for their own pockets. Of course in some instances the proceeds are used for a good cause. But in many cases this is a false pretext. As we know, there are many days besides our national holidays that we can exploit, for all the causes that we can possibly think of. We need not to outrage the memory of our heroes. We must suppress every tendency aiming to disrupt the unity of our colony. To accomplish so constructive an undertaking we should try to analyze our historical events and obtain an exact meaning for the application of our patriotism.",

Due to the fact that Mexico at that time was traversing a difficult economic situation, the three foreign powers, France, England and Spain anxious to receive the payment of a best which Mexico had failed to pay on time, decided to force Mexico, by the use of intervention. Don Benito Juarez, President of Mexico, who knew that several thousands of soldiers had disemoarked in the Port of Veracruz, appointed the able jurist Don Manuel Doblado, to explain to the interventionists the economic situation of the country. Spain and England convinced of the of the situation decided to wait, but the representative of France, Mr. Saligny said \"My signature is worth as much as the paper that is written on.\" The French Army was under the command of Marshall Bazaine and immediately advanced to Puebla where they met stern resistance and defeat by the army of General Ignacio Zaragoza who fought on the hills of Loreto and Guadalupe, Puebla."

On it will appear our well known artists who will sing native songs and dance native dances, which add so much color to these Mexican festivals.",

A member of the Committee gave us this information: \"For the night of the celebration we should get all the interested people together thereby strengthing more and more our friendly relations with those who are not familiar with our country and its people\".",

It can frankly be said that its success was due primarily to its director, organizer and teacher Professor Francisco Calderon. This self-denying Mexican, was able to organize and turn into a well disciplined body fifty-seven men who compose the Mexican Band of Chicago. All of the musicians are well uniformed and this musical organization has become the pride of the Mexican colony in Chicago. This Band played in some of the States of the Union, such as Michigan, Wisconsin, Indiana, Illinois, etc. However its life was comparatively short and not so pleasant. The Band was betrayed by its beloved teacher who took over one thousand dollars and disappeared from Chicago. This money belonged to the Band, Calderon was the keeper.",
                "However, the members of the Band did not become angered by this act, for they were convinced that this sum of money could not compensate the years of work and the time which Calderon had dedicated to them. They felt sorry for the absence of their teacher and pleaded with him to come back. They realized that their ingratitude rather than his ill behavior was to blame and only wish they had done something to aid Calderon financially since music was his only source of income. After Calderon's disappearance the Band had about three different conductors but were not very successful although these conductors were very competent. The Mexican Band continued in existence up to 1931.",
                "As for the Orquesta Tipica Morales (Morales Typical Orchestra) which was organized by the Morales Sisters, in the year of 1925, this consisted of sixteen young women. All of them wore Mexican costumes and because of their youth partly, they became very popular in the colony.",
                "They also played in various Cabarets and Theatres in Chicago and in nearby towns. These young women deserve a great deal of credit for their devoted persistence to the art of music. Although most of them got married and could not continue in their career, the Morales Sisters have kept the spirit of the music alive until today.",

As a consumer you pay taxes from the manufacturing of an automobile up to the most simple cosmetic. Your automobile license money also enters as revenue.

We lament very much the attitude of the latter, because one deviation cannot be cured with another. The remedy in such case would be to proceed with serenity to the examination of principles, and at the same time the conduct of its exponent.

They are celebrating the Independence of Mexico after they have slaved our people; they commemorate our Father Hidalgo and condemn his work; they read the Act of Independence which is in itself a profession of faith and deny its contents. Hidalgo and those who signed the act of Independence as well as the other heroes were believers and Catholics.",

And they do not only blaspheme against God, but they also glory themselves upon their crazy atheism threatening God as a pariah, as an inhuman and criminal being. Disgraceful, little by little the whirlwind of the divine ire shall fall upon them and there shall not even be left a memory for those to follow. \"The Congress of Anahuac solemnly declared that they shall not profess or recognize other faith than the Catholic Religion, nor they shall permit or tolerate any other; that they will protect with all its power, and will watch upon the purity of its faith and Dogmas\".",

                "With the object to make known the \"Intimate Proclamation of Christ the King a leaflet was reprinted by the Mexican Youth of Chicago. It seemed as an act of destiny that one of these leaflets came into my hands. The original was printed on Dec. 25th 1932 by the Mexican Liberty League for the rights of Man. It was disguised under the Intimate Proclamation of Christ the King in order to provocate and insult the Mexican Government. This is a very ridiculous thing to be tolerated. In view of this fact, I am going to permit myself to point out some of the mistakes contained in the above mentioned. I shall begin by asking the members of the so called Liga Libertad de los Derechos del Hombre, to please go to school first so that they may be able to define words; Citizenship, Revolution, Right and Man. Because in their utmost inconsistent sheet they exposed the ignorance and clearly show the clay from which the coward, and traitors are made of.",
                "Those who with all pretuberance call themselves Defenders of the Rights of Man. Tell me, gentlemen, \"defenders\" how can you justify the assertion made in your first paragraph, \"that the right of citizenship have been taken away from the Mexican people by the Revolution\"? Gentlemen defenders, please take notice that the revolution in Mexico means the enlargement of brains, depuration of conscience and it is the tree where the right of man may fructify. Gentlemen, can you explain the difference between Mexico as an Empire and Mexico as a Republic? According to what reveals in the contexture of your second paragraph it seems that you have not the remotest conception of History, for if you had, you would not blaspheme so stupidly as you do. By making the absurd comparation of the Act of Independence which in reality expressesl \"That the Catholic Apostolic Roman Religion\" would be the only one to be recognized nationally\"; it is also true that this occurred when Mexico became independent from our Mother Spain, today our Sister, the Spanish Republic.",
                "This, as it is natural, it was a step that Mexico took, as we commonly say; \"It came out from a burning coal, to enter the vivid flames\". Because our people continue to be chained to the same slavery since it had to obey a Monarchical Government. Now you still say, that all the constitutions that have ruled Mexico, with the exception of those issues during the revolution have been written in the name of God and with the authority of the Mexican people\". I cannot explain myself such an \"exception\". Do the gentlemen defenders believe that the Act of Independence did not spring from a revolution? Do you also believe that the glorious Constitution of 1857 was not issued in the name of God? Gentlemen defenders, I think it would be worthwhile for you to know that the Laws of all the countries have been issued in the name of God. The most meritorious statesman of the Americas Lic. Don Benito Juarez, in spite of you opposition and that of the Cossacks with of soutane was a real Christian, and his laws have taught us to be Christians and comply with our duties to humanity.",
                "Christ came to the world to teach men the Laws of Reform- the (New Testament) to free humanity from the tyranny of those who believed themselves Gods on earth, thereby usurping the rights of Divinity. In a likewise manner, Juarez the Mexican Messiah came to teach us to respect the real God, in other words, gave the Mexican people the right to respect God as a God, and Man as a Man. Undoubtedly, as soon as Christ was informed of this so called proclamation there at the right of \"His Father\", is repeating the very same words He said when He expired on the Cross; Pardon them God, for they know not what they do."

The occasion was the celebration of the \"Winter's Solstice,\" under the auspicies of the Hon. \"Hirman\" No. 6 and \"Lux-In-Umbra\" No. 50, both being Masonic Lodges of Chicago and South Chicago respectively. Perhaps, the organizers of the brothers of these magnificent groups; didn't expect such splendid results as those which were obtained at this reunion. A conjunction of artistic elements and skillful orators participated on this pleasant program, all being very happy in the fulfillment of the same. An overture was played by the orchestra directed by Prof. Medina.",
                "Jose' Garcia L. made the official address, it was very conscientious and reasonable, and for this he was very much applauded. Raza de Bronce Race of Brass, a poem written by Amado Nervo, a distinguished Mexican poet was recited by Roman H. Fortoso, who had a moment of real inspiration, he was also awarded with an ovation. Other sketches of art and equal attraction followed. Also some songs were courteously offered by Daniel Ramirez, accompanied at the piano by Prof. J. Vazquez.",
                "There were some variety numbers gallantly offered by members of the Infant Drama and comedy group which was conducted by the intelligent Mrs. Andrea G. de Rocha. After a short interval in which the children were given toys, then, the emblem of the Herman Lodge No. 6 was delivered, amidst a ceremony in which the brothers of the order distinguished themselves with their conduct and good discipline which was evidence of an advanced instruction. But, undoubtedly the highest reward had been reserved for the Hon. Alvarez del Castillo and Yolanda Diaz who made very eloquent dissertation. Alvarez del Castillo in brief but conscientious phrases told us the history of our worthy National Mexican Rite. He placed an emphasis in the fact that the Mexican Rite is legally recognized by the Great Masonic family of the Universe. Thus, weakening the prejudices which some elements try to diffuse without knowing the significance of our Masonic Society. We, the Masons of the world consider ourselves linked by an indestructable fraternal love and for this reason our society has no frontiers, because our members reside in every ambit of the terraqueous globe."

This is a very important event, because of the ability of these athletes and a large number of friends and sympathizers.

                "Even the enemies of the administration should be given the opportunity to exercise their citizenship rights. Many of our countrymen who are in exile, had read the good news published in the press. Convinced that hatreds and prejudices had been dispelled, some of the exiles, with great optimism embarked, homeward bound not knowing what disappointments were awaiting them.",
                "On their arrival at the frontier they were met by custom officials who told them, some rudely, some in a friendly manner: You cannot disembark! If the hapless one argues that there is no law which prohibits a Mexican from entering his own country, he is told that nevertheless he may not enter the country. He then tells the custom official that the trip has consumed almost all his savings, that he has given up the position he had abroad and that in the future he would take no part in politics. He further explains that he had consulted the Mexican Consul before leaving and that he was assured by him that there was no obstacle to his return, because every Mexican has a right to return to his country whenever he wishes. Why is that, when one arrive here, the conciliatory attitude described in the press proves erroneous and the information furnished by the Mexican Consul turns out to be deception. Now my situation is desperate. Without me, my family cannot stay here because I am their sole support, and they can't return with me because I am unable to pay the fare for all of us.",
                "If the custom officer is friendly he will give to the passenger a confidential explanation. - Listen, your name is on this list, and although I feel very sorry for you, I have to follow the instructions, not to let any one whose name is on the list, cross the border.",
                "But, as I wish to please you, I shall ask for new instructions and as soon as I get the information, I will notify you. This is the only consolation a custom official can give to a Mexican exile, who wants to return to his homeland and finds out, that because his name is on the list, entry is refused to him. In the meantime, the boat is ready to leave and our Mexican must return, with his family or alone, according to his financial situation. He alone will have to solve this problem. He has become the victim of a cruel game because of his trust in promise. Here certainly is a need for regulations.",

                "Those who have worked with the Mexicans and those who have studied the situation say that the Mexican is here to stay. They point to Texas, Los Angeles, St. Louis, Denver, Topeka and many other places where Mexicans are known to have permanent residences and to have been in the country for several years.",
                "Of 32,000 who entered in six months of 1928, 20,000 were men, more than half of whom were married. Over 6,000 were children under 16 years of age. Dr. Emory Bogardus of the University of Southern California says that while practically none of the Mexicans come expecting to stay, yet in a large group studied in Southern California, many of them were found to own their own homes. The number of Mexican children regularly enrolled in the schools, in many of the cities of the Southwest, points to their permanency of residence and to their increasing number. For instance, in El Paso Texas, the school population is 70 per cent Mexican. In July, 1928, there were 465 American born and 1047 Mexicans.",
                "Mexican labor is becoming an increasingly basic factor in certain lines of industry. Most of the Mexicans who come to the United States work at unskilled labor. They are much in demand for the reason expressed by many employers, that they are, not radical, easily controlled by those in authority, and willing to take orders. In the North, East, South, and West, the Mexican is being used. Lumbering, agriculture, mining, grazing, railroad construction, all demand his labor. They furnish the great supply of transient labor for the perishable crops of the Southwest. Much of their work is seasonal and they drift from one occupation to another, from state to state, and between seasons are often idle and unemployed.",
                "It is reported that in the Imperial Valley in California, each year Mexican labor picks 25 tons of raisins, 25 tons of walnuts, 5 million boxed of lemons, and 25 million boxes of oranges. In three counties of Colorado, 18,000 cared for 110,000 acres of beets, more than two thirds of its entire beet acreage.",
                "They travel with the crops and the jobs. Whole families of them may be seen loaded in old half broken-down Fords, going from the oranges to the cantaloupes, then to the grape picking, and then to the walnuts. From the beet field they go to to whatever work is offered them.",
                "In the Southwest, they are the principal highway builders and almost exclusivelu, the railroad section hands. They pick much of the cotton in Texas and Arizona; they tend vineyards, citrus orchards, walnut groves and melon fields in California; they care for the sugar beets in Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, and California; they are in the copper mines of Arizona and New Mexico.",
                "Women, too, are numbered among the workers. Though women have not migrated as much as the men, they are being used throughout the Southwest, in industry. Their entrance into industry has been gradual, but they are there in considerable number. In the agricultural districts they are engaged in many tasks, weeding, chopping, and hoeing beets, picking and packing fruits.",
                "Mexican labor is found in the construction and maintenance-of-way gangs, as soon as the weather opens up in the spring and as late as it will permit in the fall. The vice-president of one western railroad states that his road has steady employment for about 1,036 Mexicans, and during the summer when construction work is in progress, an employment of as many as 1,478. The engineer of maintenance -of-way of another railroad, states, that his road employs approximately 9,000 Mexicans. Only 4 per cent of these, he states, are employed in other than maintenance-of-way forces. Practically all of the western railroads employ Mexican labor.",
                "One road reports normally 1,800, the number increasing to about 2,900 during the peak season in track work, and to some extent they are employed in the store departments. Another reports employment of as many as 2,600 in 1926, mostly used as track men all over the system. According to an official of another railroad, his railway employs 500 to 1,000 Mexicans in track work in Iowa, Illinois and Wisconsin. Many of the great industrial centers claim their quota of Mexican workers.",
                "They are to be found in the steel mills of Gary, the slaughter and meat packing houses of Chicago, Kansas City and Omaha, the mines of Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado, and railroad construction work and maintenance-of-way. In Chicago, the 1925 Report of the Department of Public Welfare, lists 1,042 in the steel mills, 606 in the Coundries, and a considerable but uncomputed number in the railroads and packing houses.",
                "In one large cotton mill in a southwestern city, the entire force of 400, is made up of Mexican women and girls. Many of the girls appear under the age limit set by the Child Labor laws. Mexican women are also found in the garment factories making overalls and jumpers. Being good needle workers, they are used also on finer work, such as infant's and women's wear.",
                "The practice of contracting for family labor is not uncommon expecially in the cotton, fruit and beet fields, where whole families are hired to care for a certain acreage. In the early morning at the market places in some of the cities of the Southwest, where labor agents hold forth, whole truckloads of workingmen and their families, are seen being taken to the fields, where jobs have been secured for them.",
                "Family labor brings its quota of child labor. Child labor is used to a great extent in the beet fields. In a personal visit to the beet fields, many children were found to work \"from sunrise to sunset.\" A 1926 study in Colorado, made by the National Child Labor Committee, listed 650 children doing some kind of farm labor, 292 of these assisted those growing beets. The children work long hours in the sun doing the topping and weeding. Especially in the beet industry of Colorado, it is claimed that the labor of children is needed. Except among a few, local sentiment seems to be with the industry and a general opinion prevails that the work of the children in the beet fields \" doesn't hurt them.\"",
                "The Knights of Columbus Mexican Welfare Committee of Colorado, holds a contrary view. It insists that \" the welfare of the child should be superior to the needs of industry,\" and that if Child Labor laws are enforced, the industry will quickly find out how to adapt itself to the new condition, and be the better for it.\"",
                "Wages",
                "The wages of the Mexican workers are very low. Priests and Bishops speak often of the poverty. The Committee on Mexican Immigration, for the Federation of Labor, in one state declares, the Mexicans in the agricultural district in the Southwest, are working for as low as $1.50 a day. It was stated by an official of the Chamber of Commerce, that they receive as much as the American worker, especially in the Imperial Valley. There is discrimination in the wages paid to Mexican and American labor. In certain railraod maintenance-of-way gangs Mexican labor receives twenty-eight to thirty-two cents an hour while at the same work American labor receives forty-two cents."

The score was 52 to 26 in favor of the Y.M.C.A. But we must take into consideration the fact that the boys of Coach Ochoa have played since the year of 1927. On the night they played against Loyola, they were tired out, because on the previous night they had played in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and had arrived here at 3 o'clock in the morning. For this reason they were unable to attend the dance that the Club Atletico Cuauhtemoc, had organized in their honor, for the night of the 27th."
