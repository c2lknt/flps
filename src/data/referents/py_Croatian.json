                "Sunday, February 28th, the branch of the Croatian Unity \"Matija Gubec\" gave a public lecture entitled \"Friends and Enemies of the Croatian People\". The lecturer was Dr. Biankini. The lecturer requested all present to register as members of the branch, because it it sad - as he said - that in such a great Croatian settlement as Chicago, there are only twenty-five members.",
                "Of course anyone who registers as a member has to pay one dollar, otherwise he cannot become a soldier for the national cause.",
                "Ten munnutes were given to registration. Eleven registered. Then the lecture began. We bring just some excerpts from Dr. Biankini's lecture:",
                "\"England went to war to defend international law and justice. If God grants it, Russia will occupy Constantinople. After the Allies are victorious all Slavic nations will be united and form a Federative Union.\"",
                "\"Russia is,\" said Dr. Biankini, \"in social matters more perfect than any one civilized state.\"",
                "\"In Russia public opinion was for war. Conservatives and liberals united for the defense of little Serbia.\"",
                "\"The war is now between Germanism and Slavism. If there ever was, now is the time to unite and to shout, that other nations may know what we want.\"",
                "The lecturer proceeded in this tone glorifying Russia and abusing Austria.",
                "Of course, nobody knows what is meant by \"liberation by Russia\" and \"unification of all Slavic nations.\"",
                "It seems the imagination of some people penetrated into special worlds, which enables them to look upon Russia as a liberator.",
                "Russia is not willing to give freedom to anybody in her own lands how could she give it to others. In these dreams, just remember the Polish nation to see the \"brotherly\" love of Russia. Dr. Biankini accentuated that, at the meeting as the people may hear from every one of those present. But when Mr. Mijo Trcak wanted to tell his opinion, he was forbidden to talk because he is not a members that means he did not pay one dollar. At that meeting the right to speak cost a dollar. This method prevents anyone from contradicting those who pay a dollar. They are unanimous from the start.",
                "There was a commottion in the hall when Mr. Trcak was forbidden to speak.",
                "It seems that certain gentlemen fear freedom of speech, the more so when that furnishes the possibility that someone could be able to name and uncover the arch onemies of the Croatian nation."

This condition causes great worry to their parents, especially those who do not understand the reasons for their children's attitude.",

Much, too, depends on the child's home training, his temperament, and his personality.",
                "In many cases, the child is alienated by the rudeness of his teachers. Considerable blame must likewise be attached to the \"dryness\" of the curriculum, to the uniform requirements and method of instruction, which demand of each child the same interest and the same ability in all subjects, without regard to his natural inclinations.",
                "However, the parents should not be dismayed when their child displays a lack of interest, or is backward in school. We may point out, for their benefit, that there have been many people who were poor students in school, far below the average, but who later became outstanding men and women: inventors, poets, artists, and good citizens in general.",
                "It is dangerous to abuse a child, to call him \"lazy,\" \"stupid,\" \"dumb,\" and the like. And it is even worse to beat the child in an attempt to make him like school and to make him study. Intelligent parents and teachers can succeed much better with reason and kindness than with rudeness and force."

We recall when the preachers and ministers proclaimed from the pulpit that drunkenness was the greatest cause of crime and poverty. And so Prohibition was enacted in order to save society. Of course, one could not expect the millenium immediately after Prohibition was introduced. So we waited. And what did we find we found that a special class of people had arisen that began to make whisky, wine, and beer illegally. Thousands of these parasites became rich. It seems that the Government is unable to cope with this evil. It has been proved that in many places the authorities and the criminals work hand in hand. In this way, Prohibition has created a new kind of crime.",

Misery is at least as widespread today as it was two years ago, and, in fact, distress is growing from day to day. Unemployment is increasing; when the workers spend their savings, they will have to go hungry. Crime is one the increase, too. Criminals are being hung every week in Illinois. New York and San Francisco are experiencing a great crime wave.",
                "How is all this to be explained. Some are of the opinion that every criminal is a mental defective who does not understand the nature and consequences of what he is doing. He will readily risk his life for money. In former years, such individuals cursed their impulses with liquor; drink made them apathetic, and they were not able to commit crimes for lack of courage. Today, these poor people have no whiskey or beer in which to drown their misery and despair; and so today, there is plenty of reckless courage in these people.",
                "In previous years, it was said that very few criminals committed crimes while completely sober. Now they are saying that people become criminals because of lack of alcohol. What conclusion can we deduce from all this That alcohol has no effect on crime? No, that would not be true: alcohol does have an effect on crime, but it is not the main cause, nor is it even an important factor. The real cause has been completely untouched by Prohibition and is still with us: We mean the widespread misery, the general chaos in society, the bad working conditions, and the maladjustment and oppression upon which our social system are based. No laws, no restrictions, no prohibitions, no miner reforms introduced by bourgeois nations will help the worker. Crime and poverty will be overcome only by the victorious proletariat, which will abolish private ownership and create a new economic order and a new culture."

The chief reason for so many divorces in America is that people consider marriage a contractual relation, which endures just as long as the two parties care to stick it out. In most cases, no deep feeling unites the couple; no attempt is made to know and understand each other, and thus provide the foundation for a lasting union.",
                "The notion that the husband has to support his wife is a legal right to which the latter clings tenaciously. If the husband is unemployed, the wife will seldom make sacrifices: she insists on her right to be supported. This egotism repels many a husband; he loses his illusions about married life, and leaves home because he sees in his wife, not a friend but a partner who sticks with him as long as life is agreeable. Marriage in America today is not a union of souls; it is a matter of \"joining hands,\" and for that reason the marriage tie is very loose, so that divorce results easily.",
                "Statistics show that most divorces are granted in the first years of married life; divorce is considerably less frequent in subsequent years. Often, the children are the tie that keeps their parents together.",
                "The great number of divorces in America is an evil that is rooted in the present-day [economic] system. The worker is a slave to need and to economic conditions. This oppresses his spirit; it is difficult to be in love when one is hungry. When a woman is driven into marriage by hunger, she cannot choose:she will accept anybody able to provide her with a better life, a life free from worry. The worker's lack of security is also a cause of marital strife,and he is driven to alcohol instead of endeavoring to improve his lot.",
                "The courts and the moralists deplore the large number of divorces, but do nothing to prevent them, to change the capitalistic system, the principal source of this evil.",

                "We are herewith submitting a few hints and suggestions on the proper upbringing of children. It is now up to the parents to adopt them and benefit by them.",
                "1. Use the utmost caution to avoid instilling fear into your child and letting it get a permanent hold. Don't tell frightening stories to your children, as our parents used to do, and don't let others try it.",
                "2. Teach the child to be obedient. This doesn't mean to develop in him a feeling of inferiority, or an attitude of submission. The behavior, and the language, of parents, teachers, and other adults must be such as to inspire the child with respect and obedience. Naturally, the child should not be asked to do anything improper, unjust, or harmful, and he is perfectly within his rights to refuse to do anything of the kind.",
                "3. Train your child not to \"pick\" his food; he should eat whatever his mother sets on the table, whether she is serving a meal for the entire family or for him alone. An exception may be made in case of a physician's order, or in case the child has a violent dislike for certain foods.",
                "4. Teach the child how to meet and overcome his difficulties; tell him they are inevitable, that one must expect them, and that life is not all play, but is real and earnest, with opportunities and responsibilities. If you do everything for the child while he is small, he will become soft, weak--in fact, plain lazy--and will never be able to fight his own battles.",
                "5. Teach the child to be considerate of others, to do something for them now and then, even things he may not like to do. This training is necessary in order to keep him from acquiring habits of greed, selfishness, and vanity. A person who cares nothing for his fellow man is his own worst enemy. The greatest pleasure in life is derived from doing good to others, especially when it makes them happy.",
                "6. Teach your boys and girls, while they are still very young, to perform small but useful tasks. This does not mean that the child should be considered a slave and made to do heavy, onerous labor; it does mean that the child should be taught to do light, useful work. Make him responsible for some small task for the house or for his own needs. A normal child enjoys working in the home, and a well-trained child will not depend upon his father or mother, or the maid, to do his own work.",
                "Never ridicule or laugh at things that children take seriously, even if they are absurd. Try to explain to them, and make them realize, exactly what is wrong, so that they may know better next time.",
                "When we realize the profound effect of the impressions received in childhood, we no longer wonder in the least that the science of child training has formulated these rules in the conviction that parents should abide by them to the letter. These rules are the foundation for the child's future life, a foundation which must be strong in every respect."

Not only were they obliged to overcrowd their rooms more than whites, but they had to pay more rent than the whites. Many colored families had to endure starvation, in order to pay the high rents and keep off the streets. Colored people could rent lodgings only in their own districts, and there they were overcrowded.",

In other works, write organized workers must either peacefully watch colored workers take their jobs, working longer hours for less money, or they must undertake the job of organizing the colored orders and in that way eliminate the danger of losing all that the workers have gained up to this time."

His aim to organize separate unions by trades was fulfilled. From its start the A. F. of L. grew. But Gompers was by his education, by his nature, by his social position,not only a conservative but a reactionary.",
                "His organizing talent was not for the creation of militant workingmen's unions to lead an uncompromising class struggle, but it was for cooperation, like his colleagues Legien, Thomas, McDonald, etc.",
                "Gompers hated Socialism as well as all progressive ideas. Also he was the greatest enemy of Communism. No led a bitter fight against industrial unionism when it became a necessity in this country after the great industrial expansion of America. He also hated those who wanted to make the reactionary A. F. of L. a tool of a class conscious struggle in the labor movement. Among them was Comrade W. Foster, one of the greatest enemies of Gompers.",
                "During the war Gompers was with Wilson and his fourteen points, the most faithful servant of capitalism.",
                "If there was a strike, Gompers was the first to end this strike in favor of capitalism. Through his efforts many strikes were lost, many workers' lives sacrificed on the altar of Wall Street. Gompers was even against the name of Socialism. He watched to see if there was any danger to capitalism in order to warn it in time. For the same reason he went to Mexico. Gompers did not travel there for the benefit of the working class, but to protect the interests of American capitalists who were after the natural wealth of Mexico.",
                "Gompers was born in a capitalistic society and reared there; in working men's ranks he was a faithful servant of capital; for it he lived, traveled and served to the end.",

However, they were forced to hear the accusations, which could not be minimized.",
                "Fitzpatrick proved that the workers receive wages on which they cannot get along. Then he touched upon the corruption used by the companies to keep their workers out of the unions. \"There were,\" he said, \"many union men who did not mention to their own wives that they belonged to a union, from fear this fact would be made known, and the workers fired from their jobs.\" Not only that, but the companies watch that such a worker is not employed in any other place.",

                "At the hearing, J. Kennedy, president of the butchers' union gave the information that the companies played a dual role. They have slaughterhouses in New York, where they were forced to sign with his union. The same union asked several times to be recognized in Chicago but was always refused.",

The union paid burial expenses. The poor woman had no money to buy bread. Her husband was injured at work and died at the County Hospital. She is left on the street with three children. Her late husband earned 27 cents per hour. They lived in one room, paying eight and a half dollars per month rent.",

Also this family has just one room, two children on the floor in the kitchen. The family has no bed sheets nor blankets. Everybody covers himself at night with his own clothes. Their food consists of coffee and bean soup. If the husband is sick, the wife goes to work in his place. Her job is then to clean killed hogs.",

She continued that the workers have been organized only six months, the women two months. But the employers are great enemies of the unions.",
                "The attorney for the Wilson firm refused to give any explanation about wages paid by that firm. Pressed by the judge, he declared that it is forbidden him by his firm to talk about this matter. It was proven that all firms act in accord on how much to pay their workers.",
                "Because the arbitration will take few days, the court asked both parties to decide how many hours daily the hearings should last. The workers' representatives asked for eight hours, the companies' representatives declared five hours were enough.",
                "During the hearings, the organizer of the American Federation of Labor, Kitulski, revealed how brutally the workers are treated in the companies' work shops. The companies have private spies and police and maltreat their workers. Kitulski said: \"I protest against the acts of the private police of the companies who beat up workers if they are late for work. I protest against the treatment of foreign laborers who are subjected to abusive language of vilest kind. Just because these workers do not understand English, they must not be treated like cattle. They were lured by agents from Europe to make slaves of themselves in the slaughterhouses.",
                "The other day I came to the house of a workingman. He had not yet come from work and his wife was also away. In the house were seven children without shoes and stockings or socks. The children were compelled to stay inside. Fifty per cent of the workers in the slaughterhouses, who are foreigners, are starving. The company officials handle women just as brutally as men.\"",
                "Agnes Nestor from the Women's Trade Union League stated that men who are getting 21 cents per hour are laid off, in their place are hired women, who are paid 20 cents per hour. These women must work just as hard as men do. Even in the killing department women are employed. Though the women do there the same work as men, they get just 20 cents per hour.",
                "Mrs. Nestor protested because women are employed in the killing department. Women must do work, which is not fitted for them, while the men must rot without work.",

Working conditions are terrible and particularly so in the textile mills and chemical works. No attempt except that made by the young workers of the Young Workers (Communist) League, has ever been made to organize these young workers for a fight for full economic and political rights. What are full economic rights? Membership in trade unions, equal pay for equal work, etc. Only recently has their been a tendency among young workers to fight for their rights in the political and economic fields. That is the position of the capitalist parties in regard to this question. They disregard this question entirely. Not in any of their platforms have they even hinted at this question. Not one of the capitalist parties desires to have the youth vote or receive full economic rights.",

The blame lies with the leaders, who are in the service of capitalism and not in the service of the working class, but its enemies. With a change of leaders the unions will begin to climb.

(2) Constantly it is necessary to organize unions against bureaucracy in the union itself. Bureaucracy stands against the working class. (3) It is necessary from separate unions to make one great union. (4) It is necessary that all unions, however small and dispersed, become one large union and give it a certain political direction.

                "The fight of the steel workers against the gigantic trust which sucks the blood out of hundred of thousands of workers in America. The struggle is hard because there are among the workers many foreigners whom they try to extricate from this struggle and make them slaves of American capitalism in the name of thankfulness, for the benevolence of American capitalists who are willing to exploit these workers.",
                "The capitalistic press started with lies to discredit the American worker. If there is nothing to report we are informed how workers return to work, how factories open, how workers are tired of strikes. All such news has the tendency of making the workers weak, to break up the strike.",
                "It seems here the people know the lies of the capitalist press and nobody believes them. Some paper will bring the news that this strike is the work of Russian bolshevicks, but that turns out to be a lie.",
                "The organizers of this strike are without exception of Irish extraction, which can be judged by the names J. Fitzpatrick, E. J. Evans, J. E. McCadden, J. L. Beaghan, J. McGraig, J. Williams, H. Young, H. M. Runsee, De Young and . Foster. If there would be just one Russian name it would be a help to capitalistic lies. But because that is impossible, the papers report that bolshevick agitators appeared some place and were dispersed.",
                "One day we will hear that this strike is the work of the Irish Sinn Feinn. The number of strikers is not known. There are around 300,000 of them.",
                "If the trust insists on killing the workers as it was done in 1892 at Homestead and McKeesport, some other trades may join the strike and the other industries will be paralyzed. The coal miners of Pennsylvania, the seamen and railroad workers are ready to strike.",
                "Saturday, before the strike started, the Wisconsin Steel Company at South Chicago closed its doors. This was considered the real start. That same day twenty-five organizers of the American Federation of Labor held a conference. They declared this will be a one-hundred-per-cent strike. In Waukegan the union secretary asked that one hundred workers be sworn in in order to keep order.",
                "The company swore in 300 sheriffs, whose duty it is to provoke the strikers and beat them up.",
                "In the State of Pennsylvania the companies swore in sheriffs by the thousands, who will be ready to kill each worker who is fighting for his interests.",
                "Statistics show that in all factories the number of strikers is 518,000. At South Chicago there are about twenty factories on strike, in Gary, Ind., six factories, at Indiana Harbor, Ind., eight factories, at East Chicago, three; Hegewish, two; Hammond. six."

So thought the bourgeois politicians of the 18th century when they led the bourgeois revolution against the feudal lords; and capitalist politicians of today think likewise.",

Regardless of how melodious their motto is, and how much our upper crust boast that it made St. Radic a genius, we openly declare that behind this phrase deceit and confusion are hiding. Justice! For whom? Is it justice for workers and peasants or justice for capitalists and landlords? Before we Jugoslav workers follow this confusing motto, they should ask the foregoing questions. Justice is an abstract word. What is justice for one class is injustice for another. That which is justice for capitalists and landlords is injustice for peasants and workers, and vice versa. When one baron or lord owns more land than ten villages together that is justice for the owners, but great injustice for the peasants.",

At a recent gathering of about 300, in commemoration of the death of the late St. Radic,here in Chicago one of the speakers said Radic's greatest service and genius was due to the fact that he always had a longing in his heart to emancipate humanity. What Radic carried in his heart we don't know. We know only that of which he spoke and what he did, and from this basis we make our deductions and form our conclusions. But if for the sake of argument we allow that he did, then what? We know know that mankind is divided into two classes: poor and rich, exploiters and exploited, tyrants and serfs. Longing for the emancipation of all humanity doesn't mean emancipation of only those who need freedom and are struggling for it. The capitalists and landlords have no use for the emancipation of humanity. They are not enslaved nor exploited, but they are that part of mankind which lives off the great majority of mankind: the workers and peasants. These are the ones that wish for their class to be relieved of the yoke of capitalist and land-lord slavery. We Communists, however, think differently than Mr. Radic and his followers. We workers demand freedom for workers and peasants, from Belgrade's bloody regime, and freedom for all workers of the world who are enslaved by the capitalist tyrant system. This is in plainly spoken language what the working class should undertake. We don't call our program a motto as some pseudo emancipators do, who, under their various-cloaked phrases and words, such as justice, equality, freedom, humanity, etc., hide their policy of class serfdom for the working people.",
                "But emancipation from the capitalist regime will not come with magic words (hocus pocus), as our pseudo-intelligentsia want us to believe. Emancipation for the enslaved class, workers and peasants, colonial people and various national minorities, comes by way of organization, relentless struggle against capitalist tyrants and their cause. There is no other way out but to fight, and we contend that various patriots and chauvinists who come to the workers with their words of justice and humanity, are interpreting justice in the interest of the capitalists' and landlords' class, under misleading phraseology."

                "First, this is the first time the Jugoslav fraction will operate nationally along lines of a completely centralized party. Until now we had a federation in unity with other federations, which at best could be called the \"Communists' conference of America.\" Later we accepted centralization, but in practice we worked as a federation. Eventually the party re-organized but traditions of the federation did not disappear. As language fractions are not separate political bodies, but principally propaganda auxiliary means by which the party in general operates among Jugoslav workers, it is logical according to the proletarian party rules and according to the party constitution that the central committee has a right to appoint language committees. This is one step ahead in the course of our centralized party.",
                "The deepest impression left by the plenum's first meeting is the change of the general party policy among Jugoslav workers in this country. Another significant effect of this plenum will be the manifestation of solidarity in the Jugoslav fraction. We must admit that we had misunderstandings: but we also affirm that our enemies wishes that our fraction would split and be dissolved will not be fulfilled.",
                "We had manifested our solidarity in the past, but this present manifestation of unity will show excellent form.",
                "In the first place the unity of our movement will be expressed in future political work, while in the past our movement was seldom so remarkable.",
                "The plenum's intention also is to solidify this work with organized measures which will move our forces and put every effort on a responsible basis and furnish new elements to our ranks, freedom to rise to the necessary height in our movement and work.",
                "We are confident that plenum in this direction will be significant and will manifest interests of the movement and the working class as a class. The members of the plenum will acquaint themselves with new requirements in movement and create necessary decisions which they will later bring before other members of the fraction. They will be the controller of the situation and experiences of our party so that we all can benefit from them. The plenum will also be a school for our movement, a school of class struggle against our political enemies."

Is it not a problem if a small band of lazy men have all the riches of society in their hands and dominate that society, compelling those who are creating riches to live in poverty, while the lazy bones and the felons have all the luxuries? That is a great problem. Who works to solve that problem? The bosses, who are in control of everything, do not want to. They work to keep conditions as they are. But such a situation does not suit the workers in this country or in other countries. They are the ones who according to their historical position are called upon to change the standard of things.

Because he proclaimed the truth about nature, religion, and customs, and that is considered \"un-American\".",

That is the declaration of the representatives of capital in the United States, of its agents and of all the factors which mold public opinion, and they think that any political movement or economic theory is defeated if it is declared \"un-American\".",

Are the agitators to blame that many things cost 500% more today than years ago?",

At the same time the federation will organize the Jugoslav workers in America under the flag of revolutionary socialism, then she will accomplish nobly her task in the universal socialist movement for the liberation of the international proletarians."

                "The American capitalists pointed to Great Britain as their most dangerous competitor and all that was said could be considered true to some extent. According to the commission's report the average weekly wage is twice as large here and at the same time, working hours are shorter. Both things taken into account show that wages per hour are fourteen per cent higher than in England.",
                "But - according to statements of the commission - the unfavorable conditions are equalized by two things: First, the English manufacturers must have for the same amount of production twice and one half as many workers, at the same time, the use of horse power is eighteen per cent higher.",
                "One more surprise is in the report of the investigating commission. The ship-building industry of England is the oldest and best in the world. So it would appear, shipbuilding must be most profitable for British shipbuilders. But it is not so. The British, to increase the value of $1,000 of raw material to the same amount,have to spend more also in shipbuilding. Exactly $79.00 more than Americans ($679 against $600) Taken into account that most products are sold in England much cheaper than in the United States, we can draw two conclusions: First, the profits of the American capitalist must be extra high; second, the strain of the work must be frightful, because only by unmerciful exploitation is it possible for the American capitalist to drive out of the worker more value in production than in any other country of the world.",
                "That the overstraining of workers in the United States is a common thing is well known.",
                "The Taylor's system and other refined methods, control of the workers' every minute, are introduced in many factories. He who is not able to give the requested quantity of work is thrown on the street. It is no wonder that a workman of forty is considered an old man. Some times younger men do not get work.",
                "This murderous exploiting system must end. That will be done by a conscious working class, organized in the economic as well as in the political field - in workers' unions and the Socialist party. It is these how the purpose to put and end to exploitation of man by man, one class by another."

The number of proletarians grew. Farmers and tradesmen who were forced to quit augmented the number of unemployed workers. Today the worker has to fight with his fellow worker for his daily bread.",

But the most distressing fact remains that there were \"leaders\" and\" prominents\" who led the workers' struggle from the right path, who misguided the workers for the benefit of capitalism. Yes, Gompers, Mitchell and others rendered great services to capitalism. If they did it voluntarily or against their own will does not change in the matter.",

There capital is the ruler. In the legislature there sit representatives of capital to make laws, order taxes and tolls. The cost of living goes higher. The government sends the army against strikers. The Courts prosecute any labor movement. Boycotts are declared to be against the law. It is impossible to enumerate all evils against labor caused by capitalism for the reason that the workers did not recognize in time that their fight thru Trade Unions is insufficient. They neglected to lead a political fight. The workers supported capitalistic parties, did not care to send workers as law makers to have influence on economic questions. The capitalist did understand the political impotence of the worker and took away and grabbed these few things which the worker had acquired in the previous struggle.",

                "In the course of time many changes occurred. Labor Day is not what it was before. To appear friends of labor the capitalists made Labor Day a legal holiday and by that robbed the Day of his sharp demonstrations of parades. The befooled workers were led by the political capitalistic speculators and parties. The consequence of all this was that any workers' movement is persecuted, the courts and authorities suppress strikes and organizing of workers -- and call it a conspiracy because the political powers are misused."

There were many faults but the biggest, the unpardonable one, was the neglect to lead the fight on political ground, on which ground the working classes of Europe have made great successes.",
                "The American worker laid stress to fight through trade unions. Organized in trade unions the American working classes fought for better working conditions, better wages, shorter hours, etc. Strikes in many places were organized and by and by the conditions were improved. But what happened? In spite of many successes in the fight, the workers are in bad circumstances, the conditions are getting worse day by day. Working hours are lengthened, wages reduced. In one year more was lost than was gained in ten years. The unions are paralyzed. The cause for all that trouble is the method of the fight.",
                "In the trade unions' fight there was no backbone. There was nothing done to make the accomplished gains permanent. There was nothing done on a political ground. Politically there was neither fight nor success.",
                "The American worker thought that he lived in a free country and did not watch nor see how enemies of the working people robbed them of freedom. While the American workers neglected an independent political action, the capitalistic class took and holds all the political power, more than in any other country. For that reason said class is oppressive and arrogant. For that reason the rights of the people in America are abridged. Just on account of its political power the capitalist class in America dominates everything. Any movement of workers is persecuted. Against the strikers they send the police and the army. The Supreme Court declared even a boycott illegal. All that shows the mistake that the working class made by not leading a political fight along with the trade union movement.",
                "But things changed recently. The working people see their way clear. They admit that along with the trade union movement there must be a fight for political rights. In all workingmen's circles they talk about an independent political action and the Socialist Party is growing rapidly.",
                "The working class is convinced that it cannot trust the empty promises of the capitalists. It has to have its own politics. It must vote for workingmen's candidates, who in turn will take care of workingmen's needs."

We must, if we want to overcome this foggy darkness, and keep out of these entangling nets, have at least $100,000 which will enable us to go ahead with our work.

All the extreme merits or faults of their candidates have not to be taken seriously.",

                "Much money was spent, much energy used, many false statements made, many people were misled. All that was done in order that everything may remain as it was before, regardless of the person that was elected. All the candidates were branches of the same tree. For that reason it makes no difference, of course, to the people, who is elected."

The Russian government, for the sake of sordid gain, has been poisoning and wrecking its own people, knowing that an exhausted, drunken people cannot win the war. Tsar Nicholas arrived at the conclusion that the abolition of \"vodka\" would win the war, and with one stroke of his pen stopped the production and sale of liquor. All the Russian people have changed since. Former miserable slaves became the dread of their enemies. There is no whiskey in holy Russia, but sacred patriotism, and enthusiasm for human and Slavic ideals.",

The Huns of modern times, the Germans, have been figuring that their Jewish agents would easily foment a revolution among the Russian people against their native country as they have already lost everything through drink. They figured that with Jewish help they would be able to subjugate all of Russia and bring her under the influence of their Germanic culture.

This idea was favorably accepted, and in 1868 a law was passed in Congress decreeing an eight-hour working day for all workers and employees of the government.",

The workers of Chicago kept their promise. On May 1, 1886, twenty-five thousand workers left work.",
                "The capitalistic press, aided at first the workers' demand for shorter hours as a just one, but changed its mind when the workers stood their ground. The result was the well-known Haymarket affair, which cost its leaders their lives and which set the movement back for many years.",

Only death can liberate them from burdens of work. If they lose their limbs, they are free from work but are lifelong beggars.",

The attendance of that lecture was miserable, according to the statement of the president of this \"Branch\". The scant attendance may be attributed to whatever reason one cares to, I will not try to explore that. The lectures was Dr.Biankini. The theme of the lecture: The Rebirth and Ideals of a Nation. Whoever tried to guess the nature of the lecture from the announced title must have been mistaken. Under \"rebirth\" Dr. Biankini understands progressive ideas of the modern social life; legislation, hygiene etc. The \"Ideals of a Nation\" are to him the same, that school \"philosophers\" taught for centuries and centuries. It was to be expected that the honorable Doctor was going to speak about new Ideals, which are moving the world. But we must not forget that the lecture was held by the \"branch\" of the \"Croatian Unity\" which is noted for its backwardness.",
                "Let us hear more details:Dr.Biankini proved with statistics that there are more of our people from Croatia, Dalmatia, Istria, Bosnia and Hercegovina in America than it is believed. On may count in the United States over one million people of our blood?",
                "We are not so few, but we are without influence, because we're not organized. Besides, our people are one of the most neglectful ones. One of its first shortcomings is the habit of settling in dirty sections around factories where there is no sun, air, nor light. The wives of our workmen take 10 to 15 men as \"boarders\" work for them from dawn to sunset. Overburdened with work, they are not able to devote much time to cleanliness. These conditions are the reason for such maladies as diphteria, tuberculosis, and trachoma, which prevail among our people here. Because their mothers have to work so hard the children cannot develop as they should from the start in their mother's womb. When they are born they do not have the necessary care, so it is not surprising that the mortality of children in our communities is terribly high. A nation, which wants to continue as a nation and to progress as such, must be healthy. Now the lecturer mentioned of modern legislations in some states, where there are strict health rules, maternity aid, etc.",
                "Never did I expect, the honorable doctor to mention those causes,, why our people live in such bad conditions, exactly as we socialists know them to be. Neither did I expect, that he was going to propose the same remedies as we Socialists do.",
                "But at the same time I never expected the honorable Doctor to say what he really said: A shortcoming of our people to settle in unclean streets around the factories, that spouses of workers keep a great number of boarders and are overburdened with work.",
                "That is what Dr.Biankini says. But the question is, are these shortcomings the fault of our people or is that not hard, unavoidable necessity, because otherwise the worker could not live whether in time of unemployment or during the preparation for \"rainy\" days. Dr.Biankini mentioned frequently the social question, the social relations. But we can not be satisfied with such superficial explanations of the most tragic social consequences.",
                "If Dr.Biankini had conceded, that the people are not to blame, for the miserable living conditions of our people in America, but the economic conditions which are characteristic and are the sequence of our social structure of today, he would have been forced also to do something against all that; he should have said the condition must be altered or changed from the ground up - completely as we Socialists do demand it. To do so he should be a Socialist. But he is not a socialist - he is a bourgeois and a member of \"the Croatian Unity\". For that reason he is satisfied to propose, as a remedy against evils from which our people suffer; the progressive legislation as in foreign lands, and to recommend hygienic rules and fewer but healthier children. But to call for a fight against the cause of all social evils, against the capitalistic system - he is far, far away from that. Alas! The purpose of \"The Croatian Unity\" is not to teach to fight but to stullify the brains, to make them stupid and through verbal confusion to make them incapable for thoughts and life.....",
                "It is not enough - continued Dr.Biankini that the people are physically well and materially strong, but they should be strong of soul and mind. They must have ideals, they must cultivate certain virtues. He counted seven of them: character, audacity, justice and so forth, in the end; religion. Without religion a nation can not exist and then added in conclusion; a man without faith in God is a beast.",
                "\"They say - the doctor continued - that science progressed so far, that it is not necessary to dispute about God anymore. But I, as a man of science, was confirmed by science in my belief in God\".",
                "I was astounded when Dr. Biankini said, that a man without religion was a beast. Then all the philosophers, starting with Democritas, throughout the centuries up to the present time must have been beasts. Were savants, like Renan, Strauss, Feuerbach beasts they who studied religion more than anyone else? No they were not, the same as people who have religion are not beasts. Doctor! I think you did not know what you are talking about: God forgive you!",
                "About Rev. Relich, who as the president of the \"branch\" closed the lecture. I do not want to say much. I want only to mention that he repeated the lecturer's assertions about religion, man and beast, adding that all those are \"felons, robbers and miscreants\" who divert people from religion and their priests\".",
                "Now, I wish somebody would prove that \"The Croatian Unity\" is not in the service of black reaction, as it was pointed out by Radnicka Straza last year."

                "Dr. Soskor, a Serbian student of dentistry had been a member of the Jugoslav Volunteer Legion during the World War. After the armistice he completed his studies and started to practice in Chicago in 1919. By 1922 he had a large practice at 31st Street and Wentworth Avenue. At about this time an ex-priest, Mr. B. Milosevic came from Europe with the hope of starting a movement for a national church. For this movement some sort of periodical was necessary and this publication called for financial backing, which Mr. Milosevic lacked. Young Dr. Soskor was easily persuaded to come to his assistance and a partnership was formed to publish a monthly magazine named Novirod. This magazine, ably edited, was so educational and high class that it did not find enough readers in the colony, as the majority of the Croatians were not used to reading about psychology and philosophy.",
                "Dr. Soskor, seeing that his venture was not going to be profitable, withdrew his support and terminated the partnership. Dr. Soskor's enthusiasm for fresh adventures carried him to Hollywood in 1928 where he wrote a play and wished to direct it himself, but after a year's time and effort he found the movies hard to crash and returned to Chicago. He can never forget his embarrassment when one producer, upon interviewing him, remarked, - \"What does a dentist know about directing a play?\"",
                "Dr. Soskor, politically a bold Jugoslav, is an admirer of President Roosevelt."

                "Man was not born to live alone. Man needs companionship. Man alone was not able to defend himself against wild animals or against the elements of nature. He established a family. Several families formed a tribe, and several tribes a nation. Man alone can do hardly anything well. One makes tools, the other uses them in cultivating soil, to give us bread and clothes, the third one builds dwellings to give us shelter, the fourth makes all kinds of articles in a factory necessary for life, etc. This mutual activity created all the necessities and luxuries of life.",
                "While it is true that today's progress is the work of mutual activity, it is also true that all men do not equally enjoy its results. This injustice brought about many movements aiming to right that injustice. Time only can tell if the collective movement on which our building and loan association is founded is just an unsuccessful experiment or a solid foundation for the economical liberation of humanity.",
                "The idea of collectivism originated when man helped his neighbor to build a home, to cultivate his fields or helped him with other necessary work. That must have been at the dawn of civilization.",
                "The cooperative or collective movement started in England at the end of the 18th century, when the weavers of Rochdale organized the first cooperative.",
                "From that movement developed a mighty cooperative movement to which twenty-five million people belonged.",
                "Here in America we have many successful cooperatives. Fruit growers in California and Florida, farmers' cooperatives in Minneseta, Michigan, Texas, etc., fisheries on the coasts of both oceans, gardening cooperatives on the Atlantic coast. In most of these cooperatives you will find Croatians.",
                "To this chain of collective and cooperative activities belong also the building and loan associations.",
                "What are those associations?",
                "The shortest definition is: the building and loan associations are financial institutions founded on a cooperative basis. Under the control of the state, their aim is to help the members to own their own home and to pay for it under the easiest terms.",
                "In the building and loan associations the members save collectively and loan money to their fellow members from their realized savings. The profit derived from such business is equally divided among the members. The business is conducted collectively for a common profit. Like other cooperative enterprises the building and loan associations appeared around the year 1798.",
                "In America the first building and loan association was established at Frankfort, Pa., which town is today a suburb of Philadelphia.",
                "The associations are united in a league under the name United States League of Local Building and Loan Associations.",
                "What is the difference between a building and loan association established on a cooperative foundation and between financial institutions organized on another principles?",
                "In capitalistic financial institutions the control and management are in the hands of the few. You may have some shares, but you have no vote. In the building and lean association each member, even with the smallest investment, has a vote. Not only that, but he may also participate in discussions and has the right to elect and to be elected an officer or director of the association.",
                "In capitalistic institutions the depositor is a dead letter, without significance without value, while in cooperative associations he is a live unit, which acts and takes part in all the proceedings.",
                "The depositor possesses voice and power, which in capitalistic institutions only privileged persons have, especially those who command large investments.",
                "Our Croatian people who came to this country from villages, where the cooperative idea is strongly implanted, did not pay much attention to this kind of economic organization for many reasons of which the first one is our lack of understanding of business in general and the second one is our lack of great business ability.",
                "How could a peasant coming from a village have these abilities? But after a short while our Croatian grasped those things of which he was ignorant for lack of early schooling. He saw what other nationalities were doing, and so he did the same thing.",
                "Little by little in denser Croatian settlements appeared Croatian institutions and foremost among them the First Croatian Building and Loan Association of Chicago, Illinois.",
                "In normal times while men are working regularly they deposit their membership dues in the loan association. The other members accept loans on which they pay interest, which in turn is paid out to the depositors as dividends. The association, taking money from one member and loaning it to another member is nothing else but an intermediary between parties. The money is not left with the association but only certain financial papers remain there as a guarantee that the deposited money will be returned with interest. As long as people are working everything runs smoothly. But when employment fails the members are few, the deposits and payments occur seldom and the association must limit loans and repayments to depositors.",
                "The First Croatian Building and Loan Association acted at the start of the financial crisis as befitted the situation. It was saved and that is of the greatest importance. And yet, as far as the conditions did allow the association helped, however modestly, its depositors.",
                "In the modest but careful operations of today, this association waits for the opportunity, like a ship to lift anchors. The association survived. We must be grateful for that.",
                "Officers and directors of the First Croatian Building and Loan Association: Mike Knafl, president; Michael Juricek, vice-president; Mike Staresinic, secretary, Simun Lackovic, treasurer; Frank Halaus, John Knafl, Thomas G. Latkovic, Josip Mlaker, assistant secretaries; Mile Biondic, Vinko Kovacic, J. Siranovic, trustees; F. J. Petru, notary public; F. L. Petru, Attorney.",

                "This book shows the causes which led to organize this association and how it was developed and its influence on the life of our Croatian people in Chicago and vicinity.",
                "It is also our wish that this book should become an interpreter of the present conditions of this institution as well as of its activities in the past. To show of what benefit it has been to our people, which in turn will serve as a true guide for further work.",
                "The Starting Point",
                "One day, 1910, three friends came together by chance - Tomo Lackovic, Mike Staresinic, and Josip Mlaker. Their conversation turned to our social life, which was very active in those times. Charitable and cultural societies were springing up among Croatian immigrants. Although there was social progress, a void was left. There was not one banking institution to take care of the small savings of our Croatian workers, to teach them to save, to keep their money for times of need, and to help others by their savings.",
                "These three friends felt the need of such an institution. They decided then and there to establish such an institution. They set a plan and made the necessary preparations for the establishment of the first Croatian building and loan association.",
                "Thoughts were put into action. The first meeting was called for the 10th of May, 1910, at the residence of Simun Lackevic, 1819 S. Fisk Street. On this occasion Tom Lackovic explained the necessity for the Croatians in Chicago to organize a financial institution and made the motion to establish the First Creatian Building and Loan Association, Chicago, Illinois. This motion was seconded with great enthusiasm.",
                "Mr. Cyril R. Jandus, a notary public, had the application for a charter ready. The application was signed by Tomo Lackovic, Mike Staresinic, Janko Mulig, Ivan Bozic, Petar Hergeg, Aleksa Braje and Simun Lackovic, who are charter members.",
                "With this act was laid the foundation for the first Croatian building and loan association. The next meeting was held at the same address on May 16th, 1910, at which meeting were present Mike Staresinic, Josip Mlaker, Ivan Bozic, Inocent Miller, Jankolovrencic, Simun Lackovic, and Tomo Lackovic, who became the first members, upon the declaration of Tomo Lackevic. After the registration of the new members Tomo Lackovic was instructed to start, and it was resolved that as soon as one hundred shares were subscribed the first public meeting would be called and officers and directors would be elected.",
                "The first public meeting was held June 20, 1910, at the same address. On request of Tomo Lackovic, C. R. Jandus explained to the assembly the by-laws, also the law according to which the association had to function. At the same time the purpose of the institution was explained as well as the duties of the members, directors and officers.",
                "The first officers elected that day were as follows: Juraj Soic, president; Andro Pozgaj, vice-president; Mike Staresinic, secretary; Tomo Lackovic, treasurer; Anton Vidicek and Josip Mlaker, assistant secretaries; F. J. Kovacevic and Simun Lackovic, assistant directors; Dragutin Miskatovic, Josip Malker and Anton Vidicek, trustees; C. R. Jandus, notary public and attorney.",
                "The assembly voted to put the secretary and treasurer under bond. The officers declared that they would work without pay except the secretary, who will receive one dollar per week. It was resolved to hold meetings each Wednesday evening at 1819 S. Fisk Street, at the same place and time business is conducted today.",
                "All above named members, officers and directors of the First Croatian Building and Loan Association are considered as pioneers of this first Croatian enterprise. They spent much time and labor among our people, visiting their homes or locals in order to convince the Croatians that they should save. It was a thorny path at the beginning. This small crowd of determined men we have to thank for the existence of this Croatian institution.",
                "From this short presentation of facts we see that the Association was established in the home of its present treasurer, Simun Lackovic, its faithful servant from its inception until today.",
                "Activities and Work of the Board",
                "Each beginning is hard, especially that of an institution to which our people were not accustomed. The beginning was made more difficult because there were men who out of ignorance or of suspicion spread fears among the people, saying that for such an enterprise we lacked experienced men.",
                "The administration surmounted these difficulties and invested its own money to gain the confidence of the people.",
                "By such action the officers and directors won the trust of the people in the association.",
                "A junior section was established. Parents paid for their children fifty cents per week. Also a so-called class \"C\" was formed. The member paid at once $75 and received a share of $100 par value. If the money was withdrawn before maturity the depositor received 4% interest.",
                "Affiliations",
                "After the first difficulties the First Croatian Building and Loan Association was successful. Its membership increased by granting loans in small instalments for building or purchasing of homes.",
                "To enlarge its business the association decided in April, 1912, to establish representative offices in Croatian settlements around Chicago and vicinity. Such an office was first established in South Chicago, June 26, 1912, at George Lalic, later on, this office was taken over by Frank Radocaj, 9627 Commercial Avenue.",
                "In 1913 another branch office was established among brother Dalmatians at 2344 Wentworth Avenue. A third branch was opened in 1916 in North Chicago, 1102 Sheridan Road. This branch was opened at the request of Croatians of that section. For the same reason a branch was opened at Lyons, Ill. The fifth branch office was established at 5943 S. Justine St. Thus the business of the association was spread over all the Croatian settlements in Chicago.",
                "The previously mentioned class \"C\" was not a success, therefore class \"D\" was introduced, on which $100 was to be invested at once, bearing interest every six months.",
                "On September 25, 1922, a class \"AA\" was introduced, payments extending for three and a half years. Both innovations were very successful.",
                "The association bought from the government bonds and war stamps totaling $1,083.80. The bonds were redeemed by the government in 1922, the war stamps in 1923.",
                "Acceptance by the people",
                "Our first Croatian Building and loan association was accepted by the people as a real national institution. Numerous letters expressed their good wishes at our 25th anniversary. Not only private persons but also societies became members and invested money in the association, giving, by so doing, their own members an example.",
                "Through small deposits the members were possessors after some time of larger sums of money, which enabled them to enter business independently or to buy their own home. By the accumulation of small deposits the association was able to grant loans in small installments, thus promoting self-assistance. Figures show that mortgage loans were granted to the amount of $4,100,000. This means that the Creatian people owned that amount and many came to own their own homes. The books also show that $3,800,000 were withdrawn. This generous amount was the result of small saving deposits; their owners avoided by these proceedings to become public charges or to depend from their friends and relatives.",
                "From the first 500 shares the association had thus become a great business institution.",
                "But also somber days did come with the arrival of the depression. The value of real estate dropped. The First Croatian Building and Loan Association and its members were hit hardest through this devaluation. Although many financial institutions went bankrupt the First Croatian Building and Loan Association weathered the storm and awaited better times.",
                "In these days of grief the management tries means and ways to help the members to save their homes and savings. Many homes were saved. They would have been auctioned off under other circumstances. The association has fulfilled its duty during the most trying times for our Croatian immigrants.",
                "We must stress these facts to encourage our people not to lose heart, but to rally around their own institution and to save the First Croatian Building and Loan Association for themselves and their compatriots. By chance the 25th anniversary occurs during these hard times. But the First Croatian Building and Loan Association has overcome all the difficulties.",
                "Conclusion",
                "It can be seen from our statements that the First Croatian Building and Loan Association did not limit its activity just to the city of Chicago, but extended its business beyond the city limits. Also, it did not just collect deposits but made loans, too, making it possible for many to become owners of their own homes.",
                "The junior section numbers now a few hundred members. By such a procedure the parents have taught their children to save instead of squandering the money.",
                "It is remarkable that of 12,600 building and loan associations in this country and 966 of them in the state of Illinois, not one went bankrupt or closed its doors. In this hard depression the business of such institutions is badly obstructed. Claims are not paid in time, but everybody gets his money surely if slowly.",
                "Retarded payments are due to the fact that debtors are not able to meet their installments regularly because of unemployment. Retarded payments are not the fault of the management as many believe.",
                "The First Croatian Building and Loan Association operates according to the State laws. Each member of the board is bonded. This association is a member of the U. S. League, State of Illinois League, Cook County and Czecho-Slovak League, also of the Federal Home Loan Bank and as such it is under state supervision.",
                "(Signed) The Board of the First Croatian Building and Loan Association.",
                "Congratulations to the First Croatian Building and Loan Association on its 25th anniversary from Tom Lackovic, charter member and first treasurer.",
                "Three thousand miles away I join the magnificent celebration and congratulate the First Croatian Building and Loan Association in Chicago, with ardent wishes to keep up and to proceed with the work so that the children of our Croatian immigrants will be able to celebrate the 50th anniversary and through it remember their fathers. All in honor of our Croatian nation.",
                "My special congratulation goes to the Board of Directors of the First Croatian Building and Loan Association for their arduous work and for their ability to withstand the crisis without losses. Have this work continued so that this, our financial institution may prosper and be a sign and an example of the cultural ambitions of our Croatian people.",

The heir was willing to sell the shares, but afraid to be defrauded, requested the office to do it for him. He received the answer,that not one of the seventeen companies was registered and could not be found anywhere. The shares could not even bring the value of the scrap paper on which they were written.",

The so-called prospector finds a place where, he thinks, there must be gold, he organizes a company of share holders. Most of the shares he retains for himself. With the money received for the shares sold the work is started.If gold is found to reimburse the share holders very well. If there is no gold found the work is stopped. The company exists no longer, all money invested is lost.",

It is even more so a play about the picturesque peasant life in an old country village, with all its venerable, century-old customs and traditions. Seeing this play, young American-Croatians can learn more about the real old country life than they have ever learned from all the stories told them by their parents. Besides there will be our national costumes, our national songs, tamburica orchestra, and the inevitable Kolo dance. In all, about thirty people appear in \"Gypsy.\"",

But do you understand them, and would you take the trouble to learn to understand them? This play is an intimate portrayal of the country of your parents. See how difficult it must have been for them to adapt themselves to your world, and you will not be too stern in your criticism of them.",

In appreciation of their good work, members of the club Sloboda, at their regular meeting held May the 14th, unanimously voted to contribute a sum of $25 to the Radnik Fund and because members of the club have always supported Radnik and wish it to be among the first in this campaign.

                "Last Sunday February 21 the Jugoslav educational association gave a grand entertainment with a program of speaking and drama and dance in the Croatian Hall in South Chicago. The Kezele orchestra from Joliet, Illinois, played for the dance and between the acts.",
                "Right in the beginning I must admit that a large attendance was not expected this time. One of the reasons is because of the Lent. Many of our countrymen otherwise craving for wholesome entertainment are still under the influence of the church and religion and somehow abstain from plays and entertainment during the religious season. The extra large attendance surprised all the members and many sympathizers. The surprise was more noticed because the Catholic priests were talking from the pulpit against this entertainment urging the people not to go and commit a \"sin.\"",
                "Now I don't know exactly whether it was because of this forbidding and condemning the entertainment, or some other reason, but the people were curious and the largest crowd came to see the play, hear the speech and enjoy the evening.",
                "Early in the evening all the seats in the large hall were taken, the gallery and the aisles were packed. At 7:30 P. M. Mr. Ivosevic opened the program and suggested that all be quiet during the speaking and the play. Then he introduced Mr. T. Cvetkov, editor of Novi Svijet, who in short outlined \"The Emancipation of Balkan people.\"",
                "Mr. Cvetkov in the short time of thirty-five minutes briefly outlined the recent history of the Balkan, when they fought among themselves, their suffering and the price they paid.",
                "Asked if there is a way out the speaker outlined one way: that is, for all workers and farmers of the Balkan States to organize, agree on a Federation of the Balkan and get rid of their exploiters. The Balkan people are not alone in this struggle, and they would receive moral support from millions of workers and farmers of the world.",
                "The well-known group \"Nada\" from Chicago played right after the speech.",
                "The play was acclaimed by all and one could see the gratification in the audience. There were many From Gary, Whiting, Hammond and other surrounding towns. After the play all must have felt reborn because they realized deep in their hearts that at best killing and massacring brothers can only serve as a disgrace to society and civilization.",
                "Comments were heard from many level-headed people openly praising the Jugoslav Educational Association which sponsors this kind of educational entertainment. It is hoped that even those whom the priests forbade to come were not disappointed.",

These leaflets were written after the school of Marx, Lenin and Radek, pointing out the Croatian Day to be an assault on your pocket and mind.",
                "But that was of little effect. Those who considered themselves Croatians came to the celebration.",
                "The committee in charge had not only much work, but also great responsibilities. Our enemies worked full speed and bad weather also had to be taken into account. A failure of the celebration might have caused great expense, which would have had to be borne by the Croatian church and school, just for the profit of whom the celebration was intended.",
                "Thanks to the courage of the committee, the consideration of our Croatian merchant, Mr. John Radosevic, and of the Gambrinus Brewery, the preparations progressed in the hope that the Croatian people would respond, making the celebration a moral and financial success.",

                "The celebration started with a parade from the Croatian Catholic church through the loop of South Chicago, to Mackinaw Avenue. In the parade participated the school children (boys and girls), forty members of the Croatian Ladies' Club Branch No. 1, Chicago, in national costumes, with flying colors. Then came members of societies of the Croatian Fraternal Union, the Catholic Croatian Union, and other independent organizations. Thousands of people, when the parade disbanded, proceeded in buses, trucks, automobiles and street cars to the picnic. It was estimated that 10,000 were present at the mass, which started at 10 A. M., at which officiated Rev. S. Andrijanic, assisted by Rev. B. Jerkovic and Rev. B. Bilandic.",
                "During mass the Croatian Singing Society Velebit rendered holy songs under the direction of Prof. Ivan Horvat. The sermon was given by Rev. Jerkovic. He spoke about the attacks made against the church and against the Croats. The hearers applauded, forgetting that this sermon was a part of the mass. This proves that the people adhere to their Roman-Catholic church and their Croatian nationality.",
                "After mass a lunch of barbecued lamb was served. There were many speakers, among them Alderman W. Rowan of the 10th ward. He praised the Croatians highly for their love of religion and their love of their old homeland.",

Mr. Brown stated that an attendance of over 51,000,000 participated in the uses of the many park facilities last year, and much larger attendance was expected this year.",
                "Several of the publishers expressed regrets that Governor Horner and some of the members of the Legislature were inclined to cut the park pegged tax levy from its last year appropriation $9,000,000 to $7,6000,000. They pointed out that Chicago's parks are poor men's gardens and recreation havens, which serve the best interests of our thickly populated city. The parks furnish our young people places for wholesome recreation and education, thereby building characters and keeping our younger generation away from bad influences which are productive of crime, they said.",
                "Mr. John Lindrup pointed out that there are other places where cuts can be made and thought it unwise to take it out on the poor by penalizing the Park District. \"Chicago's parks, small parks, playgrounds, field houses with its many activities bring untold joy and pleasure to the millions of Chicago citizens and to other millions form near and far who come here to enjoy our fine parks and beaches,\" he said.",
                "Peter S. Lambros made an earnest plea in behalf of the parks and complimented Mr. Dunham on his fine work in the interests of the people of Chicago. He said: \"Every citizen of Chicago should use his or her influence with the Legislature not to cut the tax levy and cripple the Park System because our parks are the finest in the world and they are the best salesmen we could have to sell the greatness of Chicago to other people of this country and the world.\"",
                "From the expressions voiced at the meeting it was plain to see that the public will favor the continuance of the fine service the parks are giving and that no reductions in that service would be advisable.",
                "It certainly would not be fair to the Chicago taxpayer to reduce any of the splendid facilities that the parks furnish to our people."

                "A short while ago a campaign was started for the Radnik and directing instructions were sent to all party sections as to how they may proceed to help pull Radnik out of the present crisis. When the Chicago section thrashed out this question it elected a committee to make plans for a successful campaign.",
                "The committee arranged the plans and called on the members of the Chicago fraction to submit a plan which divides the city into various colonies, and assigned a group of comrades to start work in their districts. They also called subscribers and sympathizers to a gathering where they were asked to volunteer for agitation.",
                "The Wentworth colony has already acted. Many were present at the gathering. Comrade Bosuric explained the part which the labor press is playing in contemporary class society, and the only way through which workers can realize and learn their class duty and educate and prepare themselves for the eventual struggle which is approaching.",
                "The comrade also touched on the part which the workers' press played in ex-monarchist Russia, where Pravda was the spark of that volcanic outburst of 1917. It buried tsarism forever and established the power of the peasants and workers over one sixth of the globe. It founded the basis of the Soviet revolution which follows the policy of the Russian Bolsheviks, tore down the old and corrupt order, and built a new one. That is communism under which there will be no exploitation.",
                "At the conclusion of the comrade's meeting it was called to order. All comrades volunteered to work; they will agitate in pairs. A long and constructive discussion followed and it was decided that a banquet would be given on May 19 to the one receiving the largest number of subscriptions.",
                "I might mention that during the discussion great interest was shown in Radnik. Workers realize the importance of the labor press. Here is one example: When we spoke about premiums and prizes for those qualifying in the three-month drive for subscriptions, some declined the premiums and offered them toward the spreading of class consciousness among workers. The greatest premium, if we succeed in multiplying the number of workers, is to share our ideals so that we may build a revolutionary movement.",

For that purpose a collection of $94.25 was made for traveling expenses. A workers' paper was to be published but there was no editor available.",
                "At that time there lived in Croatia a young man who was in the way of many of the leaders of the labor movement. He was a Social-Democrat, but quite different from all other leaders. The working men liked him, the authorities hated him, other leaders disliked him. Keen, but clever; a born revolutionary, he was driven from place to place. He was not wanted by anybody, until finally he was drafted into the army. He was Milan Glumac.",
                "For his own good as well as that of the Socialist Party, Glumac was chosen to go to America and start Socialist propaganda among Jugoslav workers. Glumac wrote to his comrades in America: \"Dear Comrades: The Central Committee of the Socialist Party wants me to go to America. I accept because of my personal situation and your needs. It will help the movement and myself to evade the army into which I was drafted though sick. We will work shoulder to shoulder against capitalism. I am ready to come.\"",
                "A few months later Milan Glumac was in America. At a meeting for publishing a Croatian workingmen's newspaper, the Radnicka Straza, he said: \"Comrades! Contemplating in this short time the life of our immigrants, I came to the very sad conclusion that the worst elements among them are their leaders, who are the meanest frauds, the boldest adventurers, bearers of stupidity and immoral outcasts. With such leadership our people is doomed. They are ready to commit any crime against the immigrant, without remorse or feeling of responsibility. That means it is our duty to enlighten and to organize the Croatian workers in the Socialist ranks. Be not deceived, that will not be an easy matter, but against capitalism and its servants we must lead an unmerciful fight.",
                "All were in accord with the above statements. Glumac moved from Allegheny to Chicago, where a Socialist branch was also organized. A short time after, on December 25, 1907, the first number of Radnicka Straza was published.",
                "On its first page was a fiery proclamation addressed to the Croatian immigrants written by the editor, Milan Glumac.",

Long enough you have been cheated by them. Take your fate in your own hands. Join a great circle of working men. Take care of yourselves. Do not allow wolves to take care of the sheep.",

Forward, for the holy work and justified struggle! We must not remain miserables and slaves forever. Forward! Subscribe and read Radnicka Straza.\"",
                "After only a few years of strenuous work, the Jugoslav Socialist Federation grew larger, and the newspaper had more subscribers. All the work rested on Glumac. There was no money to hire co-workers. The editor and his wife shared the office of Radnicka Straza for their living quarters. The place was crowded and dark. Many persons unemployed came to the office to get warm. Life was full of misery, but Glumac never complained. When his presence was most needed he became sick with tuberculosis. That was in 1911. Glumac left to recuperate in Missouri and later in California. He returned to his dingy office, where he died January 5, 1913.",
                "When asked how he became tubercular, he related his life story thus:",
                "\"I was born in 1884 at Bosanski Samac. I was born of poor parents who had me learn the printing trade. That paid little and was a killing job, at least during my apprenticeship. I worked here and there and became a typesetter in Budapest, where I worked for the Narodna Rijec (People's Word), a Socialist paper. I also wrote articles and did well because I read much and did propaganda work since I was 18 years old. After that I went to Narodni Glas ( People's Voice), at Novi Sad, as editor, with the duty of going out to towns and villages to agitate. I did this work gladly. In the town of Srijem (Sirmium) I held one of my most successful meetings. From afar came peasants on wagons and on foot, under red banners. The meeting, most demonstrative in form, was calm and very dignified.",
                "\"The next day I was taken to jail by gendarmes. Without any hearing I was told (I was) to be deported to my domicile as a person dangerous to public peace and order. On the spot I was ordered to leave, guarded by a policeman. Traveling on wagon and on foot I reached, after a long wandering, my domicile. Even the weather was against me. It was raining and cold. I was compelled to remain overnight in jail in my wet clothes and that was the start of my sickness.\"",

Look around and you will see the Labor Party attacked from all sides; attacks are made against American Communists from all sides. A united front of reactionaries is evident on all fronts, beginning with the department of justice, the 'yellow' Socialists, all are against our movement. Facing this, what must we do?

                "In the spring of 1907 they wrote from Allegheny, Pa., to the Central Committee of the Social Democratic Party of Croatia and Slavonia, asking for moral help; also for the sending of an editor who would be able to work in a shop and at the same time edite a newspaper. The undersigned, evading the military service for king and fatherland, chose the service for Socialism and accepted the position.",
                "It was decided, on October 13, 1907, at a meeting in Allegheny, Pa., to establish a Croatian Socialist newspaper.",
                "Having in mind the progress of our Socialist cause, Chicago was chosen as the location of the newspaper. Chicago and vicinity will remain as it was, the heart of Socialism and proletarian revolution in America.",
                "I came to Chicago with some fear because I did not know anybody there. But I met some comrades at Chicago with whom I was connected in Zagreb, Croatia, in our Socialist cause. It was only natural that they were enthusiastic to establish a Croatian Socialist paper in America.",
                "At Christmas, 1907, times were bad. The industrial depression was in full swing. Thousands of Croatian workers were without work. Many tried to escape from the promised land, \"Dollarica,\" (America).",
                "Our enterprise, to start a Socialist paper at such a time, looked as daring as pernicious, not only to our supporters but also to our enemies. Both expected our first edition would be the last. Our enemies denounced us as anarchists. Those who were not three years in the country could be deported. The police were fed up with demonstrations of the unemployed and waited just for the occasion to get hold of the \"revolutionaries.\"",
                "But all the persecutions suffered by the Radnicka Straza did not wreck it; the Croatian workingman recognized that the paper was the only paper which was his paper, his faithful guard and leader in his struggle.",
                "From a modest start in the midst of poverty and misery our Radnicka Straza was developed, a herald who called the Croatian workingman into the proletarian fight for his liberation. The start as well as the keeping up of this newspaper for five years exacted many sacrifices of poor proletarians, who suffered much, not minding so heavy a burden, expecting neither glory nor compensation.",

                "The opinion on the merger of both newspapers is divided. Members of the Croatian section, and one member of the Serbian section, think that it is easier to agitate for and propagate Socialism with two newspapers, one written in Latin, the other written in cyrillic. These members see in the merger a step backward. The Serbian members, except one, of the Serbian section point out that there will be no progress for our press if both papers are not merged in one.",
                "It is necessary to point out the reasons for and against such a merger. For the merger was Comrade Frank Petrich, publicly in the Slovenian paper Proletarec. He is for the merger of the Serbian and Croatian sections as well as the newspapers, because the financial condition of both is weak. By a merger the number of subscriptions would increase and assure the edition of a new newspaper.",
                "Comrade Spasoje Markovich made also a plea for a merger because, as he said, the Serbian and the Croatian are one people with two names; their language is one language with two kinds of alphabets. Comrade Markovich suggests to merge both papers into one under the name Radnik, printed with both alphabets.",
                "To answer these reasons for a merger I must say that the financial standing of the newspapers is not so bad. As to using both alphabets in one paper I must say, In the Serbian section there are 150 members, but their newspaper has 800 subscribers.",
                "There are 600 Croatian members and the newspaper has 1,800 subscribers.",
                "Among those readers there surely are 50% who are not able to read cyrillic letters. But among the Serbian readers are a considerable number who do not, or will not, read the Latin alphabet. A paper printed in both alphabets would not count more subscribers than the Radnicka Straza has today.",
                "But such a newspaper prevents the agitation for our cause among those who for whatever reason do not read both alphabets. The main purpose of our papers is to propagate Socialism, and then national unity and other things.",

Hundreds of them wanted to help but they were pennyless. One more thing. At the time when the paper was started many swindlers and adventurers cheated our Croatian people who lost confidence in similar enterprises. Our paper was met with distrust at first but to thousands of workers our organ is a welcome friend today. To keep up the paper much trouble and efforts were necessary. After a day's work in shops and factories the comrades came to the office to work on the paper late at night. They demonstrated to be able to wield the pen as well as the hammer. Not only their work but also their earnings they donated to keep up the paper. That was done by our workers all over the country who did recognize the importance of a workingmen's press. There we are in the third year now. From a small crew we number thousands at present. In the same manner workers of other nationalities are rising. We are becoming more numerous. One day we will conquer the world. The Radnicka Straza will continue to fulfill her duty in the fight for the working class with more force than ever. Her program will remain THE AWAKENING OF THE WORKING CLASSES AGAINST ALL THEIR OPPRESSORS AND MALTREATORS.",

No sacrifice is too big to be offered in this fight. For that reason it is the duty of all honest and sagacious men to participate in this struggle and sacrifice for their lives."

                "I wanted to point out the personal frictions, the intellectual leadership, the diplomatic efforts and work, but what is of most importance the great number and active help of our people who are immigrants, these the leaders could appeal to and point them out as a living part of our Fatherland, as people, who did have the right and could speak and determine their fate and their national destiny. - in those times, when the majority of the people could not do so in their own Fatherland.",

By this time, of course, the material did grow, a material which must be used for a background of events, for those who want impartially to judge and to comprehend that spirit which existed in the immigrants. Without that comprehension and understanding it is impossible to know the part which our immigrant played in the great war, to the admiration of all those, who did have occassion to see him and to know him better. A part by which he laid a cornerstone in the building of his Fatherland, but also his part in the upbuilding of the world's civilization. Because he became connected in his fight with greatly advanced people, sponsors of sublime ideals.",

In the interim the misery, taxes and assessments which drew them from their homeland grew larger. On the other hand, the development of great industries in this country held the immigrants back from returning home. Restriction of immigration and bad conditions at home, as well as a forced Americanization, are also reasons why the immigrants stayed in this country.",

The purpose of their coming was not work, but business, connivance and speculation and to live on the workers. Little by little this kind of immigrant was augmented by newcomers who became small proprietors, merchants and tradesmen. A separate, distinct group, of which the attitude was inimical toward the working class. This element invaded the benevolent organizations, where most of the workers were represented. Then they succeeded in wresting control of the organizations for themselves over the members' heads. As there are different political currents in the old country, they developed also among the immigrants here. Wo we see benevolent associations of immigrants divided into political groups.",

Many Socialist leaders instead of remaining true to the Socialist cause and its principles, brought Socialists from other lands who became traitors to the proletarian cause.",

In 1916 about 30 locals of both Croatian unions became members of this corporation. In 1918 both unions decided that their members be assessed two cents per month for the building of an orphanage. In 1921 this assessment was raised to five cents and in 1924 to ten cents per month for each member. At the end of 1925 the contribution of the National Croatian Union was $138,668.18, the Croatian Union of Illinois, $45,000, the Corporation for the Building of the Orphan Home, $23,146.70.

Many changes that were made in the last eight years were made at the request of the State Department. For instance, that the home must have a playground, its own nurse, dentist, etc. The state insists that the children have the best facilities for their mental and physical development. The supreme board as well as the committee in charge of the home try their best to give such facilities to the children, which sometimes is impossible, like keeping the place from being overcrowded.

The intention of this association was to support these children by means of various contributions. But after several years our biggest benevolent organization, the Croatian Fraternal Union, extended its support to the association so that the desired goal could be reached sooner.",
                "We worked industriously on all sides, contented that our dreams were materializing, not suspecting disruption. When the C. F. U. took everything in its own hands we thought that, if ever, now it must go ahead smoothly. The association was eliminated and the C. F. U. with its president, the famous Chicago \"master,\" Mr. Cazolic, had a free hand.",
                "After reading recent correspondence from various sources and persons the heart breaks to hear and see that some children, after being subjected to maltreatment, were told they must also pay if they wish to remain in the orphanage. Why is this done and what is the meaning, why do the members pay their monthly assessment when unfortunate widows must pay only to be abused and humiliated?",
                "We have thousands of children in America who should be taken care of, they should be considered first. Why take those unable to pay and why assess those unable and poor. Every child in Desplaines knows there is something wrong somewhere. We have six buildings and a school, and in Villa Detroit (name of one building), one Swedish lady reigns alone. Four of the buildings are empty and have had not fire in them all winter, walls are cracked and crumbling, while thousands of our children throughout America are hungry and freezing. What do they intend to do with these buildings? Do they want the elements to destroy them unused?",
                "The president and officials seem disinterested. The C. F. U. convention is approaching and we will discuss this question. The building must be filled with the children and if there are not enough children, we have old folks, old members, that have been ruined under this system and must sell pencils on the streets for a living.",

Eight boys and eight girls, all dressed in national costumes, clasped hands and formed the circle. The Vrbancic Brothers String Orchestra furnished the music. This part undoubtedly would have come out the best if it was not for the interruption. The dance was in proper order and everything was going well when a few priests entered ceremoniously into the hall. Then the whole clan got stirred up and rushed to greet them, how to them and provide proper seats for them. A real riot and disturbance was created and the young dancers and players were neglected. One would rightfully expect, even of a priest, to be more respectful in a case like that, and remain at the door at least until the act was over.",

Whether this society as a whole knows it on not, it is obvious that \"Hrvatska Zena\" is a tool of some newspaperman or some individuals who have been late spreading some patent Croatianism among our people for their own selfish interests. From this we see that many put on good clothes for pure patriotism and display.",

The history of our immigration in America teaches us that clergy and chauvinism are very bad company and lodges and clubs run by them have a short life.",

Only we workers and friends of labor can save our brother workers from savage assault and brutality, and also make the strikers' struggle a successful one. The Gastonia strikers are facing their fate - this is the burning question of all the working class and their friends. They are facing heavy material losses, but they are determined to stick and to depend upon our ever ready and unlimited help. Fifteen courageous workers will be burned to death in the electric chair, and many have been convicted and sentenced to long prison terms; only our solidarity and cooperative work can save them. They need our help at once. Can we allow our fellow workers in this fatal moment to suffer. Our answer must be no! It was with this thought that our first conference decided to call all Jugoslav workers to help their striking brothers in Gastonia. Elect your representatives and send them to this convention. Elect at least two from each lodge or club.",

(Croatian Radisa and Serbian Privednik are the respective people's organizations established for the purpose of taking care of the orphans of the World War to provide food, clothing and education for stranded children.)",
                "On several occasions we have proved and will expose in the future that Hrvatski Radisa is nothing, but an agency to sell youth to cheap large Croatian manufacturers. On the other hand, what Serbian Privrednik is, the following letter from one of their students proves:",
                "\"As an apprentice of Privrednik I hate the institution. Privrednik is not doing a thing to stop the exploitation of youth, much less to improve the position of students and their conditions in existence and education.",
                "If any apprentice complains to the supervisor or committee against the master and demands an intervention, he is told: 'Well, you are an apprentice. That is your lot, shut up and stand him until you grow up.' Privrednik is raising a very thin class of qualified workers, out of which they intend to make enemies of the working class. Therefore, Privrednik may be called the central for skilfully molding fascists from the workers' ranks. That is the principal aim of Privrednik. It was plain to me when they came to us with this question: How may a student be a valuable orthodox Serb? Then they teach the student to answer thus: A valuable orthodox Serb must obey his master, must always pray before he goes to bed, go to church on Sunday, congratulate his master on his birthday and kiss his local priest's hand. And above all, a valuable orthodox Serb must never oppose his master's wishes.",
                "\"Recently, idiotic circulars were sent to Privrednik students, here is one: It is understood that no sensible person will quit his position - regardless of how bad, - before he secures another and better one. It is disgraceful for a young person to be unemployed (bum), bums get into questionable society, violence and eventually ruination. Be a man, keep your job, watch your company, avoid unscrupulous liars, bums and lazy failures, or you will, sooner or later, suffer because of them.",

                "According to the above, Privrednik is educating the youth to be future strike breakers, who will not hinder the healthy development of our home industry. My advice to every apprentice would be, if anybody from Privrednik tries to influence them, tell them: 'To devil with Privrednik, down with them! Long live independent syndicates!'\"",
                "(Signed) Revolutionary Apprentice.",
                "The article from the apprentice is very accurate and fits Hrvatski Radisa with this difference, that Radisa's idea of being valuable is that he must be a good Catholic Croat, while Privrednik appeals to the orthodox Serbian.",
                "On this occasion we appeal to our working people to be careful, watch that false propaganda, don't lead them in strike breaking, especially now. There is a contest in this propaganda, therefore we must say to the gentlemen: Neither the Hrvatski Radisa nor Srbski Privrednik, but labor unions and youth workers' organizations.",

                "Almost four hundred sturdy Croatians met in a hall at Center Avenue and 18th Street, in order to protest against the licentious ruling of the Hungarian government and its henchmen, the baneful Khuen-Hedervary in Croatia. Conditions there are known to our people from newspaper reports. Martial law exists in many towns today. The soldiers shoot people without mercy and whoever is arrested is tried and hung mercilessly. This is the reward of the Croats for having defended the Emperor and his government in 1848, against these same Hungarians, who today are oppressing them, and this because they are defending the rights given them by law. There are no rights in Austria-Hungary and as a Croatian student predicted: \"There will be no rights for the Slavs in Austria until the hoofs of Cossack horses beat upon the market-square of Vienna.\"",
                "The meeting of our Croatian brothers was dignified. The chairman was Mr. Juraj Mamek; vice-chairman, Ivan Bozie; treasurer, J. C. Jankovic, secretary, T. Lackovic; auditor Stivelic. Before the meeting was called to order, voluntary donations were brought to the treasurer's table. It was impressive, the way those hard, calloused hands contributed for the home-land, how willingly and how enthusiastically they contributed money earned by sweat and blood upon the altar of their \"Home-land\". Each of them gave at least a dollar, though we know, that Croatians are mainly workingmen and that they have no wealthy people among them. In the meeting the following was accomplished: The resolutions committee consisting of Messrs. Dr. Bianki, Pavel Hajdic and Ivan Bozic composed two telegrams; one directed to the National Defense Committee at Zahreb calling on the brothers to continue the fight for Croatian rights; the other to Franz Josef, present Emperor of Austria, in which he is called upon to put an end to the reign of the Hungarian monster in Croatia. There was collected since Thursday by means of subscription sheets and in the meeting a total of $355.80 and $51.00 for telegrams. Certainly a distinguished showing of the conscientiousness of our brother-men.",
                "One more word. It is our duty as Bohemians, to make collections for the benefit of our Croatian brothers and help them in their battle with the savage Hungarian hordes. Croatians live among us, associate with us, and participate in all our national undertakings. At the protest meeting, when martial law was declared in Prague, they took part in our meeting, spoke at the meeting and collected contributions for us. They celebrated Bohemian Day with us in 1893 contributing almost $1000.00 for the occasion. However it is now time that we showed, that we sympathize with the unfortunate Slovak nation, which is being set upon, destroyed and murdered, and that as true Slavs we stand with them."

He referred with concise brevity to the ancient Greeks and Chinese, to the Romans and other nations which had at some time achieved a high degree of civilization. He pointed out that each of them had received other peoples into its midst, had taken over the best in their cultures, had adopted their most useful customs, and had emulated their finest traits, thereby enriching its own native civilization. The speaker urged that this hospitable reception of \"foreign\" elements should be practiced by America, which is nothing more than a mixture of various nationalities and races....",
                "Mr. Cotton also urged the children of the foreign-born to learn, in addition to English, the language spoken by their parents, since they have such a ready opportunity to acquire a knowledge of two languages. It was likewise his opinion that the children should make their own the best that their parents have brought over from the old country--its poetry, its music, its beautiful dress, and its high ideals--and should acquaint the American public with these aspects of the culture of the Old World. In this way, he said, a twofold purpose would be served: first, the children would know two languages, and would thus broaden their mental horizon, their culture, and their knowledge of languages; and second, American civilization would be enriched. (We don't always find ourselves in agreement with all this talk about high ideals. We have observed too often that the English element here regards itself as superior to all others, and that the Germans consider themselves the most cultured, ueber alles.--The Editor.) In this way, he continued, the prejudices of chauvinist Americans against foreigners would be dissolved. Americans would realize the significant contributions the immigrant could make toward increasing the cultural wealth of America, and in this way a more advanced civilization would gradually emerge.",
                "Mr. Cotton urged his audience to participate in the ensuing discussion. The response was gratifying; some agreed with his views, others disagreed. Several people maintained that his ideas were not feasible in view of the obstacles offered by the American school system and American public opinion.",
                "One of our well-known leaders, George Mamek, in a brief talk, criticized sharply the cruel, materialistic philosophy of life professed by most Americans, who think in terms of their pocketbooks, and forget their souls. It is in that spirit that they bring up their children, and it is that philosophy which gradually communicates itself to the immigrant, especially to the one who comes here to improve his economic condition. Mr. Mamek's words were enthusiastically acclaimed. After considerable further discussion, the following resolution was offered:",
                "\"Our Credo",
                "\"1. We believe the presence of a variety of people stimulates creative cultural activity.",
                "\"2. We believe our children should be brought up in such a way as to develop their individuality.",

Biankini started Hrvatska Zastava, later the Jugoslovenska Zaatava. Most Croatian newspapers had their beginning in Chicago. Up to now some forty have appeared.

The capitalist employers, who dominate the government of the United States, want, by introduction of severe laws against immigrants who are mostly workers, to intimidate them and make them refrain from demanding higher wages and better working conditions through their trade unions, also to prohibit their participation in strikes. The capitalists want to hold the big stick over the heads of workers who dare to fight for the betterment of their living conditions.",

If the capitalist employers are able to force the immigrants to work for lower wages and under bad conditions, and create a lower working class of immigrants, they will be able to do the same thing to American workers. The fight against registration is not only a fight of the foreign-born, but also of American-born workers.",

                "The first period of immigration, the so-called \"old immigrants,\" brought great conflicts, because the \"old immigrants\" came mostly from Western Europe, the Scandinavian countries and Germany, being for the most part tradesmen and industrial workers who easily assimilated with the American working class.",
                "This old immigration did not form a great obstacle for a uniform American working class. But then came a new wave of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe (Russia, Austria, Italy and the Balkans) which led to a conflict between the native and foreign-born workers.",
                "The English, German and Scandinavian tradesmen were Americanized quickly; those tending to agriculture moving West to become farmers instead of remaining in the cities.",
                "With the new immigrants it was different: They were farmers and rural workers settling in industrial centers of the East and becoming factory and mill workers. Peasants and rural workers from Russia, Poland, Hungary, Italy and from Jugoslav lands remained foreigners in the United States as to language and customs. These immigrants, coming from villages, settling in great American cities as industrial workers, represented quite a different stratum from that of the old city aristocracy of workers who were proud of their trade.",
                "The old immigrants were able to read and write; the new were illiterates. The old ones learned English; few of the new ones did. The old ones became citizens of the United States; very few of the new ones did before the war The new immigrants occupied in cities closed settlements of their own nationality.",
                "Each new wave of immigrants, bringing millions of foreigners, increases the stream of unorganized workers with a lower standard of living than the real American worker. This has caused a conflict between the native and the foreign worker; between the organized natives and the unorganized foreigners. Friction between the skilled and unskilled labor grew: a social aristocracy originated among the workers. On the top of this social pyramid was the skilled American worker, in the middle appeared the semiskilled working man, and the base was made up out of new immigrants working in mines, steel mills, etc., as a great unskilled mass of workers performing all kinds of heavy, dirty and dangerous work for the lowest pay.",
                "We will not be able to understand the role or the history of the \"Knights of Labor,\" the Western Miners' Union and Industrial Workers of the World (I. W. W.) nor we will understand the question of dual unionism, the cancer on the body of American labor movements unless we try to understand and investigate the difference in the structure of the American working class.",
                "This difference is shown by the fact that the skilled American workers' aristocracy joined capitalism as an ally. On the other hand, that explains why every revolutionary workers' party appearing in America was a party of foreign-born workers. That goes for the Socialist as well as for the Labor Parties, simply because the majority of the workers in factories and heavy industries are foreigners who are exploited, ill paid and oppressed.",
                "The three different features: dual unionism, the workers' aristocracy with capitalistic ideology, and the fact that each revolutionary movement is caused by foreigners, show the difference which existed among the American working class.",
                "The World War and the years after the war brought a big change in the structure of the American working class. The conflicts, if they did not disappear entirely, are at least smoothed. The differences between skilled and unskilled labor are vanishing. During the war the great demand for labor improved wages of unskilled workers. The standard of living for these workers became better. The wages of skilled workers did not go up in the same proportion, but the standard of living for skilled and unskilled labor was equalized.",
                "Before the war and mostly during the war, the unskilled workers became organized in trade unions. The steel strike in 1919 shows the first big battle of organized foreign workers. They became a new factor in American trade unionism. W. Z. Foster, who was the leader of the steel strike of 1919, says that the foreign workers behaved better during the strike than the Americans.",
                "It was a long road from the unorganized strike breaker to the organized striker for the foreign-born worker in 1919. The same happened in 1922 in the miners strike. The relation between the unskilled foreign laborer and the skilled American worker changed. They are not strikebreakers, but strikers. They struggle shoulder to shoulder. Thus the conflict between the working class of America is disappearing.",
                "The war stopped immigration to America; the working class is not increased from foreign lands. Mass naturalization of foreigners during the war helped to decrease the differences.",
                "All changes made in the past few years in the structure of the working class hold today. This process is not yet finished, but the changes effected a conciliation so that we are able to speak of a solidarity among the whole American working class.",
                "Only the great equalization of the different categories of the American working class made it possible to conduct great strikes in mining, railroad and textile industries, where more than a million persons were in action. Only such an equalization made it possible for the few hundred trade unions to accept the resolution for a general strike.",
                "The amalgamation of the whole American working class in a homogeneous body created the idea for a great American political workers' party, which would represent the interests of the whole American working class."

And on Christmas, 1912, the Croats of South Chicago did have a Croat priest, Reverend Father Soric, to celebrate Mass. From that time on, many of the leading Croatians of South Chicago became interested in having a church of their own and a Croat priest. They succeeded in getting the Reverend Ivan A.

George Violich, a Croatian pastor from Joliet, Ill., asked the Pope to send a Croatian Franciscan to Chicago as pastor, and have a new Croatian parish organized. With this purpose in mind, Rev. Father Leo. F. Medich came to Chicago in May, 1912. On August 22, 1912, Rev. Medich received orders from Archbishop Quigley to organize a parish at 25th and Went-worth Avenue. At that time there were in that district several Croatian families, 210 from Dalmatia, 200 from Croatia proper, 50 from Istria, 35 from Slavonia, 10 from Bosnia-Herzegovina, altogether about 5,000 souls.",

There were other plans to buy another church or to build a new one, but with the consent of Rt. Rev. Dr. Quigley, the archbishop, it was decided to use the newly purchased church at least temporarily. The Croatians were satisfied, waiting for the newly acquired Protestant church to be consecrated soon, after the Roman-Catholic ritual.",
                "The Chicago papers brought the news that the Croatians had bought a church which would be called \"Croatian Roman-Catholic Church of Saint Jerome.\"This fact was misinterpreted by some misguided men from Dalmatia, and they started a harangue against the pastor and archbishop, saying that they were not Croatians, but Dalmatians, and requesting that the church be called Dalmatian, not Croatian.",
                "A committee was sent to the bishop to tell him that in the colony there were no Croatians, but only Dalmatians. The archbishop saw at a glance that they were a misguided and uneducated lot who did not know the history of their own country. He explained to them that Dalmatia is just one part of the Croatian state, that there is not a Dalmatian nationality, and that even if they are from Dalmatia, they are Croatian, remain Croatian and nothing else. This explanation did not satisfy the malcontents and one of them said to the archbishop: \"If the church is not called Dalmatian, we will not support it.\" But the archbishop did not change his decision that the church should be called Croatian.",
                "The few malcontents started against the bishop and pastor a campaign among the parishioners, urging them to use violence. The night before the dedication the windows were smashed on the rectory. After that, a strong police force was ordered around the church for protection of property and keeping order during the dedication ceremonies on December 15, 1912.",
                "As soon as Dr. J. E. Quigley, with his entourage of clergy, started the ceremonies, the few malcontents started a demonstration against the bishop and the pastor. The police cleared the church of demonstrators and the dedication proceeded quietly. After the dedication of the church the bishop gave a beautiful sermon, congratulating the Croatian people. The bishop said that he loved the Croatians, that he knew their history and the Croatian merits in the defense of the Catholic religion and their country. Dr. J. E. Quigley cautioned those coming from Dalmatia to be calm and said that Dalmatia was and is a part of Croatia, adding that he could not accept there any other nationality than the Croatian. The bishop implored the people to honor their pastor, because he had confidence in him.",

Vukonic bought a church, a school and a rectory at 28th Street and Princeton Avenue from the Swedish Protestants. On Decoration Day, 1923, the solemn dedication of that church was held.",
                "A parochial school with four nuns as teachers was started. The school staff was increased to five, then seven, and later ten sisters as teachers. There were more and more pupils in the school. In 1925 an addition of four schoolrooms was built. In 1927 was the first graduation from St. Jerome's School.",

Constant absence from such schools is considered as a great sin and will bring the name of boy or girl into the Black Book, and will bring complete refusal by the priest to perform marriage ceremonies when time arrives for such occasion.",

They feel justified to use such power or force in cases of insurrection or outbreak against their influence. Great numbers of our people paid already with heavy fines for their resistance to \"holy\" influence, or are being branded as \"broadminded.\"",

                "The real cause of the people's resistance is of financial nature; people grow tired of being supporters of the clergy, and as a result they do not care for church as they used to.",

It is hard to find an authentic record of the first Croatian who immigrated here, for no printed matter concerning the arrival of our pioneer travellers is available. We know that the first Croatian newspaper in Chicago, Zora, was edited by Jhon Kovacevic, but to secure a copy of it is impossible. Nobody cared to preserve it for future generations. A few of the early immigrants, still alive, remember others who came here twenty years before them or in the early Seventies. There were only a few of these and they were not segregated. Ten years later a few hundred were found where the loop is today. They had about fifteen saloons on State, Clark and Wabash Avenue. They called themselves Austrians and must have had some organization because they carried buttons inscribed with \"Austrian\". Their career in the loop ended during the panic of 1893, which impoverished them. In spite of their disagreements the Croats and so-called Austrians got together and organized a benevolent lodge. To satisfy both nationalities it was named \"Slovenska Sloga\". One side thought it would win the other to its belief. Neither of them succeeded. The Austrians as such disappeared and the Croatians remained until they died, but \"Slovenska Sloga\" still lives.",
                "In 1891 the Archer Avenue colony had a club \"Strossmayer\". There were only about fifteen members in it. It was organized by the more intelligent Croats for the purpose of exchanging ideas and views on life. A year later, however, they turned it into a benevolent lodge. That was the first Croatian lodge in America. It still exists. A year later more immigrants came to Chicago, settling on Eighteenth and Racine Avenue. These people founded a lodge \"Crveni Kriz\" (Red Cross). At the same time the first Croatian newspaper Hrvatska Zora (The Croatian Dawn) appeared and soon after another was issued on the South Side, named Chicago, and renamed later Chicago Sloboda."

Our Jugoslav workers were compelled to wander from factory to factory, where they performed the heaviest work under the worst conditions. Another disadvantage for an unskilled laborer is the fact that he changes his work very often and the organization of such shifting workers is extremely difficult. Even if there were a possibility of joining a union, our Jugoslav workers are very slow to join organizations, because most of them consider themselves just transients. On the other hand, as former peasants and villagers, they do not feel the necessity for organization.",

                "We reported already how the Legislators in Washington are preparing again a law, to make immigration harder. President Wilson not only does not object to that, but is in favor of it. In the last election campaign it was announced, how Wilson in one of his historical writings expressed himself very contemptuously about the immigrants in general and especially about Slavs, Italians and Greeks, to all of whom he preferred even Chinese. Before the election he tried to smooth these statements, but he is more open now when elections are far away. His hatred toward the poor immigrants the \"patriotic\" Wilson showed also by addressing to the Commissioner of immigration Williams, a very flattering letter on account of his proper handling of immigrants, while it is known - that Williams treatment of immigrants was to say mildly shameful. Williams deported many without any reason, while others he held at Ellis Island pending a long drawn investigation. Ellis Island received the nickname of \"the devil's island\". All this was done to frighten Europe's poor to immigrate. Such a man is lauded by President Wilson!"

They laugh if you tell them that microbes, mosquitoes, flies, rats, and other animals are able to spread disease. They think that sickness is not caused by any outside agency but is sent by God. They say: 'If God sends us sickness and misfortune, he knows best what to do.'",

We know the Balkans better than do some of the conceited Americans who imagine that their civilization is the best, and that other people are just savages. We do not know, however, which Balkan country is meant by the above statements. In Serbia, Bulgaria, and Greece people know how to appreciate a doctor's knowledge and have more faith in a doctor than in a priest. There are not many doctors in proportion to the population, and some of the people have had no opportunity to profit by medical science. No wonder that some in their desperation depend on a priest, a sorcerer, or even a common swindler.",

In the same issue of the magazine we read that the police arrested members of a religious cult in Zion City, Illinois, because of immorality. They were lying on their backs, pretending to be possessed of the Holy Ghost.",

A while after his arrival, a university student, Luka Jukic, attempted to shoot Cuvaj, with the result that it was planned to abolish to rule Croatia by a commissary and Doicic made arrangements to return to America. But instead of Cuvaj, Baron Skrlec was appointed commissary, so Doicic decided to stay in Croatia and try his luck on Skrlec. On 18th of August, 1913, Doicic fired a revolver shot at Skrlec, injuring his victim's arm.",
                "For the attempted assassination of Baron Skrlec, Doicic was sentenced to 16 years in prison. He served in different prisons: Mitrovica, Szeged, Lepoglava, all together over five years after the defeat of Austria-Hungary he was freed. A month ago he returned to America. We asked Doicic what are his present plans in America. He said his intention is to inform the people about the new state of Jugoslavia. He said, \"In Jugoslavia is a great disorder. The aristocracy, the clergy and profiteers are taking away from the people all necessities of life.\" Doicic said he will propose to his people to send to the constitutional assembly at Belgrade, delegates chosen from the Jugoslav immigrants, as it is done by many other foreign nations like Italy and Lithuania. The Jugoslavs in America would be entitled at least to eight or ten delegates.",
                "Doicic will give a few talks in America about life in Jugoslavia. Workers ought to go to his meetings, to hear what he says and that will open the eyes to those Jugoslavs and Serbians who believe the monarchistic newspapers."

                "The Socialists in Serbia and Croatia were the first to advocate unity and brotherhood of both nationalities.",
                "But they did not base such brotherhood on similarity of race and language. They supported the existence of brotherhood on the general Socialist philosophy, that the workers and poor inhabitants of a state are enslaved, that they have the same interests, that their salvation rests only in a powerful organization of all international proletarians and in the introduction of socialism.",
                "While the Socialists were persecuted in those countries as enemies of the Fatherland the governing classes used all means to inflame hate between the Croatian and Serbian population.",
                "There exists in Croatia a political party whose sole purpose is to oppose Serbians as well as any other nationality.",
                "For any evil, which happened in the country, the governing class blamed the \"Jews,\" \"Hungarians,\" \"Serbians,\" etc. But these governing classes avoided showing that they were the real enemies of the people.",
                "The population had been told that their misfortune was caused by other nationalities and that they should not blame the king, ministers, aristocracy, bureaucracy and the army. In this manner every Croat was educated and similarly every Serbian. Especially from the time when Serbia became an independent state and had intentions of gaining Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Austrian government and bureaucracy presented Serbia to the Croatian people as the archenemy of the throne as well as of the Croatians themselves.",
                "Until a few years ago everyone who dared to talk about the brotherhood and friendship of Croatians and Serbians in the old country was considered a traitor. In America it was not much better. The old traditional hate remained in Croatian and Serbian workers. This hate did not break out in activity, but both nationalities kept away from each other.",
                "When the socialist Jugoslav agitation started in this country, then the more intelligent workers came to the conclusion that here does not exist any reason for both nationalities to hate each other, to be strangers to each other.",
                "Here it is quite clear: that they are slaves on the same level, that they have one and the same boss in the factory, in the shop, in the mine.",
                "Here the Socialists started to preach unity of all Serbian, Croatian, Slovenian and Bulgarian workers to join in one federation, because all these nationalities speak one language, with dialects, which is understandable to all Slavs.",
                "The Socialists organized the Jugoslav Socialist Federation, which has over 2,000 members today, owns two newspapers which spread socialism among Jugoslav workers in over one hundred towns and settlements.",
                "When our federation adopted its by-laws and took its official Jugoslav title, then appeared many newspapermen - Croatians and Serbians - who claimed and complained that the Socialists try to stifle the national feeling of each separate nationality.",
                "Now these same newspapermen use the word \"Jugoslav\" for Serbians, Croats and Slovenes (letting out the Bulgars) because the Serbian and Bulgar governments are at odds on account of war spoils.",
                "The patriotic current for the unity of Jugoslavs gained in strength during the European war, and reached its crest last March, after the arrival of a man from Croatia, Potocnjak, who induced a few people to work for the brotherhood of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.",
                "The unity of all the Jugoslavs in one state except the Bulgarians is asked.",
                "It seems that this state will be under the control of Serbia, or it will become that of which the Serbian bourgeoisie dreams, a greater Serbia.",
                "From the other side we hear openly that this Jugoslavia will have the friendliest connections with Russia. Sponsors of such a Jugoslavia send telegrams of greeting to King Peter, minister Pasic and to the Serbian army. That means that these will be a great factor in future Jugoslavia, for which priests, monks, doctors, attorneys, saloonkeepers, expelled officials are now working. All of these persons who never did have or expect to have now equal opportunities with the Croatian or Serbian people. They all expect fat positions in the future Jugoslavia. Many of them wait for recognition and medals from the Serbian king and the Serbian government.",
                "Evidently it is the aim of the propagandists of future Jugoslavia to unite three nationalities into one state, bourgeois and capitalistic, where the people will become greater slaves than the working class of America.",
                "The king, the ministers, clergy, lawyers, all so-called patriots will remain at the head of the future state. They will get high positions and oppress that same people whose interests they want to unite with the unite with the interests of their exploiters.",
                "Our patriots have only one method of establishing Jugoslavia and that is war which is criminal; war to help official Serbia, Russia and their allies.",
                "According to natural laws each crime bears another, each injustice is followed by a new one. Out of war never will come a Jugoslavia which will truly guarantee liberty to all her people.",
                "Such a Jugoslav Union would appear quite differently if it were the result of a struggle by all the Jugoslav nationalities as they are, if such a Jugoslavia would have as her foundation cultural development and intelligence.",
                "At present we do not see here how the Serbian and Croatian people at home can even dream of a unity as a result of this war;on the contrary.",
                "There is exasperation and misery. The old hate became stronger on account of the conflict of Croatian and Servian armies on the battlefields and inimical agitation by Serbian and Austrian authorities.",
                "The true and only possible brotherhood between the Croatian and Serbian people will be accomplished by the consciousness of the working class and poor peasantry of both nationalities. For such a solution only the Socialists stand today.",

                "There is no other way. The only way is Socialism, which will create permanent brotherhood between all peoples; because only Socialism can break the difference of interests in society of today."

The attendance was more numerous than expected. The meeting was very instructive. Instructive, in so far, as it pointed out clearly the contradictory comprehension and interpretation of the political situation in the old homeland; the disorderliness, naivety and superficiality of our so-called \"patriots\", on the otherhand the fundamental and matter of fact discussion by our Socialist Speakers.",
                "Dr. Ante Biankini resided at the meeting. The recorder was D. Miskatovic. Of the many speakers, the first was attorney P. Perich, who spoke about the settlement between Croatia and Hungary, and Hungary's violations of that settlement.",
                "Anyone who expected to hear from Attorney Perich, a speech to clear the situation, must have been disappointed; there was only heard a tedious recitation of year numbers, of names of governors, and a few catch phrases about the merits and heroism of our ancestors whose blood \"did run on the battlefields from the river Rhine to Belgrade, from the Baltic to the Adriatic.\" For that reason we have to be worthy of our Croatian name. The speech was just like a poem learned by heart without fire, without enthusiasm and without capacity to impress the hearers.",
                "Not much better fared was the next speaker, Attorney Ratkovich. He spoke about politics in Croatia and concluded with the statement that the salvation of Croatia consists in breaking up the Hungaro-Croatian settlement of 1866.",
                "A somewhat disagreeable situation arose, disagreeable for the Committee of Arrangements when Todor Bozovich, as speaker, was called to the platform. Instead a letter from him was read, announcing that he is not able to be speaker because to this meeting, presumably of Croats and Serbians, the Serbian Societies were not invited by the Committee of Arrangements. The Committee did have ready as speaker, Dusan Popovich. His merit was to be short in his talk. In one or two minutes he was able to say all possible regarding the unity of the Serbs and Croats.",
                "The next speaker was Max Relich, a Croat Priest, who spoke about immigration. Before he spoke about that theme, he walloped the Magjars, to answer Hungarian newspapermen with more chauvinistic aggressions from his side. \"A people,\" he said, \"must not forget offenses.\" As if there are offenses by one people committed against another people. But by overexalted men on both sides just like Rev. Relich himself. What about immigration? Here is what he said, \"Officials, the clergy, the better classes, in general, betray the people, the people in turn suffers from poverty and misery. But why? For the reason, that the Croat people, just out for fun, leave their homes. If the Croat peasant would not so easily leave his home, the authorities could not find men to serve them.",
                "But the way it goes, we not only lose our lands but even our beautiful language, in our homeland penetrate any strangers and foreigners.\" That is what Rev. Relich said.",
                "That is Max Relich, Evangel, that is his logic. He does not ask for the cause of poverty. What are the reasons for emigration? The people emigrate out of foolhardiness, of pure silliness. That is the way he solves the important problem. It is very seldom that anyone did make in that way fun out of the Croatian, Proletarian, who is obliged, for his daily bread, to wander all over the United States.",
                "In spite of all that, the president of the meeting, Dr. Biankini, expressed his thanks to Rev. Relich for his \"beautiful\" oration, which fact shall be recorded.",
                "Now, our Socialist comrades, T. Besenich and B. Savich took the platform. Their statements were in accord with each other.",
                "The source of all our misery is that we find in the capitalistic system of the world the same cause that we find in Croatia in the nationalistic oppression of the Croats as well in the economic life of the people. (Relich did protest this statement because in Croatia, capitalism has not developed greatly.) Though industrial capitalism is not developed there is, especially in Slavonia, capital belonging to the big landowners, who in unison with the Hungarian Feudal aristocracy are the bosses in both countries, Hungary and Croatia. The big landowners have the peasants pay all the taxes, keep them illustrated, so that the people are not able to liberate themselves. Though Croatia and Slavonia, as well as Bosnis and Herzegovina, are not developed in a capitalistic sense, on account of their natural resources they are able to be developed, and that fact induces capitalists, in this case the Hungarian and Austrian, develop capitalism and exhaust the land. They do it in full measure and they put the national oppression of Jugo-slavs in their service. The governments in Austria and Hungary are representatives of Hungarian and Austrian capitalists, and in their hands rests the government of Croatia also. The national oppression has the purpose to crush home capitalism and to protect foreign capitalists from home competition.",
                "The Austro-Hungarian capitalism does not want to be limited just to our lands. It wants to cross the border in to the Balkans, because that is the only direction possible for expansion.",
                "The newest political oppression in the south of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy it seems has the purpose to prepare the road and to make way for the capitalists to invade the Balkans. According to that, a struggle is necessary against the immediate absolutistic oppressors in the homeland, but at the same time an organized fight is necessary by all the outlawed and extorted against the perpetrators of all those evils, which are the consequences of the capitalistic order. Only by destruction of the capitalistic order, will it be possible to eliminate the abuses of one class by the other, as well the oppression of the weaker and more backward nations.",
                "The meeting was closed by Dr. Biankini, by pointing out that for the struggle in the homeland, material help is needed. A collection was taken up for that purpose; $350 were collected. Where to send the money will be decided by a committee. The same committee will work out a resolution after two others which were submitted at the meeting."
